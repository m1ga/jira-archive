<h3>Description</h3>

My client has reported a bug where they get the following alert:

Security Violation Detected
The application binary has been tampered with. This application will not run.
This application must close.

This also happens after the data has been deleted or the application has been completely removed and installed. This doesn't not happen to me though, so there are no logs.

Going back to Titanium Studio solves the issue.

   Though this ticket is not an exact duplicate, I do believe it relates to the error messages we give end users when something is going wrong.
   
   My expectation is that they are likely on a rooted or jailbroken Android device, which would then be an expected response. However, in more recent versions we disabled rooted detection by default.
   
   If this is _still_ happening, please let us know and we will reopen the ticket.</li>
