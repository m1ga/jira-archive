<h3>Description</h3>

When I build my Android app with a continuous integration build, 4.0.0.RC2, I get an APK of 21.5mb. When I build the Titanium SDK from source, my APK is 43.3mb.

I'm using the following command to build the Titanium SDK for Android:

<code><pre>
scons build_jsca=0 android=1 android_sdk=/Users/me/Library/android-sdk-macosx
</pre></code>

That's a big APK, and too big for us to be able to use an APK built with an SDK built from source in the Play Store. Any ideas what I could be doing wrong, or what could be causing this? Same exact app source, built after just changing the SDK.

   [~athorne] An APK is just a .zip file.  Can you unzip the two and do a directory comparison to see?</li>

   Ah. Silly me, [~ingo]! The difference is the continuous integration SDK removes the assets/Resources/iphone directory and the scons-built SDK leaves it there. I'm using Appcelerator Studio to package for Play Store, BTW.</li>
