   [~anfen] can you please try with a new android application?</li>

   Creating a new default Alloy app, with no changes made by me, causes exactly the same issue.
   
   If it it helps, I believe for some reason the "mail-merge" style token *<%- encryptedAssets %>* in the file F:\My Documents\My Dev\Mobile\Titanium_Studio_Workspace\Test\build\android\gen\com\test\android\AssetCryptImpl.java, is not being replaced with the encrypted assets, and so is blank, which causes the *"cannot find symbol"* error when trying to compile the AssetCryptImpl.java file.</li>

   An update was released today for *"Appcelerator Command-Line Interface"* version 0.2.283, I was using 0.2.282. After updating, the problem still remains with the exact same symptoms for both our main app and the basic test one you asked me to create. If it helps, you can remotely connect to my PC (VNC, TeamViewer, etc.) to test.</li>
