<h3>Description</h3>

see the image below. 
***I WOULD CLASSIFY THIS AS CRITICAL***

Every time I install Appcelerator studio on windows 8.1 and then reboot the computer. 
When I try to relaunch Appcelerator studio I get this error.

Please note, that if I uninstall and re install Appcelerator Studio and then run it. Everything works.
However, if I then reboot. I get this issue.

I am running windows on bootcamp on a 2011 iMac. This point shouldn't matter, but too much data is better than not enough.

   [~sophrinix] If you drop to the command line, do you see the CLI? Is it only Studio that can't find it?</li>

   I am unable to reproduce this, using:
   
   Studio 4.0.0.201505202026
   Appc NPM 4.0.0-rc
   Appc CLI 4.0.0
   Windows 8.1 & 8.0
   
   After a fresh install of Studio and a reboot, Studio is able to launch without error</li>

   it doesn't find npm.
   
   However powershell does (usually).
   
   I'm rebooting windows again. I'll try to get a screencast video only to you</li>

   I don't see this issue on standalone windows 8.1 machine, might be very specific to "Windows on a Mac with Bootcamp".</li>

   [~codexlabs] Can you please provide the below logs for further analysis.Please enable troubleshootting option from preferences before you do this.
   This can find in Appcelerator Studio-> Preferences-> Studio-> TroubleShooting-> Select 'Debug Level' to 'All'-> Click 'Ok'
   
   1. Diagnostic Log: You can find in _Help-> Studio -> Run Diagnostic Test_
   2. Workspace Log: You can find in _Help-> Studio -> View Log File_
   
   After restarting studio, please capture these information.
   
   1. Look in windows registry for_ "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Node.js”_ key with value “_InstallPath_"
   2. Is node.exe located in Program Files ?
   _Program Files (x86)\nodejs\node.exe_
   _Program Files\nodejs\node.exe_
   
   3. Are you able to locate appcelerator.cmd file in user AppData directory. For example, C:\Users\Admin\AppData\Roaming\npm\appcelerator.cmda
   _%APPDATA%\\npm\\appcelerator.cmd_</li>

   Hello [~sophrinix], are you still facing this error in latest studio build 4.3.0. if so, can you manually install CLI in command prompt 
   
   Run,
   "npm install appcelerator -g"
   
   "appc setup"
   
   Reply with your findings, Thanks.</li>

   I don't have reliable access to the windows instance that created this behavior. :-/ 
   
   If there isn't anyone else having this issue then go ahead and close it.
