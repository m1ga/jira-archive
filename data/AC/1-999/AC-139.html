<h3>Description</h3>

I just installed the latest launch from Appcelerator saying that it has many new features and name is changed from Titanium Studio to Appcelerator Studio. But unfortunately it is not even starting. My Dell Latitude 3440 Laptop is purchased yesterday. Prior to that I was using HP laptop and everything was working fine on previous version (Titanium Studio). Killed it from Task Manager several times and waited for even 1 hour, but no luck. Studio not even loads and stuck at its splash screen.

Please resolve the issue.
