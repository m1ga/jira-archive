   [~jspain] do you mean they cannot do production builds of Ti apps or cannot publish Arrow apps?  The latter is expected.</li>

   Here is the workaround from [~rtlechuga]:
   Logout from studio, clicking in the name at the right bottom corner
   Go to command line and type: appc logout –D
   Open studio, introduce credentials
   Try to package again</li>
