<h3>Description</h3>

Impossible to make Appcelerator Studio 4 connect with Xcode 6.3.2 and the iOS 8.3 SDK. Even running the sudo xcode-select -switch command. I have been working on this issue since yesterday when I noticed that I was not able to install app builds on my device. I downgraded my iPhone from iOS 9 to 8.3, since I thought that that was the issue. When I found that it still did not work, I upgraded Xcode to version 6.3.2 to get the iOS 8.3 SDK, but realised that Appcelerator still was showing iOS 8.1 version and informed med that I was trying to build using 8.1 when 8.3 was the right choice. I newer got Appcelerator to find the Xcode 8.3 version, so I went ahead and uninstalled the hole Appcelerator and Titanium apps, libs and settings. After doing a clean install of Appcelerator 4, I dont get it to connect with Xcode 6.3.2, or Android SDK for that matter. What does I do, I get behind all schedules. Does I have to downgrade my Appcelerator or Titanium, xCode and iPhones iOS?

   Hello, Try installing the latest Appcelerator Studio, build: 4.1.1.201507141126. Make sure your Xcode position is selected with "sudo xcode-select -switch Applications/Xcode.app"
   
   After installing studio. Try running "appc setup" which will check your CLI and if needs update it will update the CLI. 
   
   Thanks.
