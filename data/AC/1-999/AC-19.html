<h3>Description</h3>

The Android NDK is only needed to build your own modules, which is not something all (first time) users will plan on. They might find the red warnings/errors quite alarming, which doesn't contribute to their first time experience.

Maybe just next to the question *Do you plan on developing cross-platform apps?* the setup could also ask *Do you plan on developing modules?*.

<code><pre>
WARN   | The following ANDROID issues were found in your environment:

	Unable to locate an Android NDK.
	Without the NDK, you will not be able to build native Android Titanium modules.
	If you have already downloaded and installed the Android NDK, you can tell
	Titanium where the Android NDK is located by running '__titanium config
	android.ndkPath /path/to/android-ndk__', otherwise you can install it by
	running 'titanium setup android' or manually downloading from
	<a href="http://appcelerator.com/android-ndk." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://appcelerator.com/android-ndk.</a>

WARN   | Some issues were detected for your environment

	Please review the above found issues that were detected for your environment.
	You should resolve these issues before building or running a cross platform app.
	You can re-run setup once they are resolved to validate.

   I'm going to suppress warnings in general here, that should resolve this and any future non-critical issues.</li>

   Resolved in appcelerator 0.1.95</li>
