<h3>Description</h3>

I have problem with publishing to Google Play Store, Appcelerator Studio always opens Plans website, even if I'm currently on Indie plan. If I right click on my project and choose Publish, modal window opens so I enter all necessary data and click Publish, modal windows closes and nothing happens. Please can you help me? 
Thank you.

   Hello [~max87],
   
   Sometimes it may happen because of user validation so you may follow this steps then try to publish your app. 
   
   1. Logout from studio clicking on the name at the bottom right corner 
   2. Logout from CLI using this command: appc logout â€“D 
   3. Open studio again 
   4. Log in 
   5.Publish App
   
   Thanks.</li>

   Hello Motiur,
   I tried to log-off and restart studio but without success. I'm finally able to distribute the app from CLI(I've never used CLI before), so for now I'm good. I had to release application for my client at the moment when I wrote this JIRA ticket, I can try to logout from studio&CLI later and see if this help.
   Thank you for your help.
   Regards,
   Marian Kucharcik</li>
