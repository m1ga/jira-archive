<h3>Description</h3>

it happens way to often that after I build my app after switching to another branch on Git, the app crashes with a message it cant find a certain key in the config.json file (CFG.js). 

I think it's best to just always recompile it, since I cant imagine it being a performance improvement nor a stable solution to keep checking everytime if "the file has changed" (because obviously it does not work).

Cleaning the app is a solution which I unfortunately have to do whenever this happens. Its a costly process

   Hi,
   
   We could not reproduce this issue with this latest environment.

   Appcelerator Command-Line Interface, version 5.0.4
   Operating System
      Name                        = Mac OS X
      Version                     = 10.11
      Node.js Version             = 0.10.40
     npm Version                 = 1.4.28
     Titanium CLI
     CLI Version                 = 5.0.5

   Target Platform             = iphone, 
   Alloy Version: 1.7.22
   
   *Steps to Test:*
   1. Create an Alloy project and paste some data in config.json file.
   2. Then call that data to the index.js file.
   3. Create two branches for that project.
   4. Run that project Android and iOS, continuously changing branch. 
   5. Result: App run successfully without any crash.
   
   Thanks.
