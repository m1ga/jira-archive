<h3>Description</h3>

My app uses TI.Cloud / ArrowDB for new user signup / email verification / authentication.

Today had to disable "New User Email Verification" on Appcelerator Admin Console, because whenever a new user creates an account and clicks on email link to verify their email , e.g.

(link in email)
<a href="https://dashboard.appcelerator.com/#/users/confirmation/L3....." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://dashboard.appcelerator.com/#/users/confirmation/L3.....</a>[long token].....77k

they get a HTTP redirect to
<a href="https://platform.appcelerator.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://platform.appcelerator.com</a>

and they are unable to verify their email account. 
Instead , they should just get a message their email has been verified. 

This was working fine until today. 

I am able to repro the issue in production and development environments.
Thanks.
