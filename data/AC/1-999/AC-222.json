So either the docs are wrong/not clear, or the API doesn't work as described.\r\n\r\nAppcelerator docs at...\r\nhttp://docs.appcelerator.com/arrowdb/latest/#!/api/PushNotifications-method-notify\r\n...it says...\r\nchannel : String/String[] required\r\nName of the channel. For multiple channels, either comma-separate the list of channels or use an array of strings.\r\nThe name of the push channel cannot start with a hash symbol ('#') or contain a comma (',').\r\n\r\nThe two commands to send a push from linux/osx terminal (with curl)...\r\n\r\n    log-in...\r\n    curl -b cookies.txt -c cookies.txt -F \"login=MYUSERNAME\" -F \"password=MYPASSWORD\" https://api.cloud.appcelerator.com/v1/users/login.json?key=MYAPIKEY&pretty_json=true\r\n\r\n    send push...\r\n    curl -b cookies.txt -c cookies.txt -F \"channel=year3\" -F \"to_ids=everyone\" -F \"payload=test\" https://api.cloud.appcelerator.com/v1/push_notification/notify.json?key=MYAPIKEY&pretty_json=true\r\n\r\n...and that works fine.\r\n\r\nWe should just be able to modify the second one to push to multiple channels, like...\r\n\r\n    curl -b cookies.txt -c cookies.txt -F \"channel=year3,year4\" -F \"to_ids=everyone\" -F \"payload=test\" https://api.cloud.appcelerator.com/v1/push_notification/notify.json?key=MYAPIKEY&pretty_json=true\r\n\r\n...but that does not work, we get a...\r\n\"code\":400,\"status\":\"fail\",\"message\":\"Subscription not found\",\"method_name\":\"Notify\"\r\n\r\nAny ideas? Am I doing something wrong, misunderstanding the docs, or have I found a bug?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nAndy",

					"body": "Hi Motiur\r\n\r\nThanks for the comment.  I tested the channels independently, and they worked fine, so devices are subscribed ok.\r\n\r\nSo...\r\n{{curl -b cookies.txt -c cookies.txt -F \"channel=year3\" -F \"to_ids=everyone\" -F \"payload=test\" https://api.cloud.appcelerator.com/v1/push_notification/notify.json?key=MYAPIKEY&pretty_json=true}}\r\n...and...\r\n{{curl -b cookies.txt -c cookies.txt -F \"channel=year4\" -F \"to_ids=everyone\" -F \"payload=test\" https://api.cloud.appcelerator.com/v1/push_notification/notify.json?key=MYAPIKEY&pretty_json=true}}\r\n...both work and come through to the devices.\r\n\r\nSo I think that verifies the channels are working and devices are subscribed ok.\r\n\r\nIn terms of test code, it is all in PHP, however, to abstracted it, and to simplify reproduction, I adapted it into single lines you could use on a curl enabled shell.  So you can reproduce this with two lines pasted from the above post onto a linux/osx terminal.\r\n\r\nSo just log-in using...\r\n{{curl -b cookies.txt -c cookies.txt -F \"login=MYUSERNAME\" -F \"password=MYPASSWORD\" https://api.cloud.appcelerator.com/v1/users/login.json?key=MYAPIKEY&pretty_json=true}}\r\n\r\nAnd send to two channels using...\r\n{{curl -b cookies.txt -c cookies.txt -F \"channel=year3,year4\" -F \"to_ids=everyone\" -F \"payload=test\" https://api.cloud.appcelerator.com/v1/push_notification/notify.json?key=MYAPIKEY&pretty_json=true}}\r\n\r\nYou will have to edit the MYUSERNAME, MYPASSWORD and MYAPIKEY values, and also set up channels with these names in your environment, aside from those elements it should be quite simple to reproduce and validate.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nAndy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
