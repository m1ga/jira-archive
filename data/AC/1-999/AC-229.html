<h3>Description</h3>

I can not login to appcelerator studio so i can develop my application. i launch studio version 4.1.0, select default workspace, then it takes along time to verify the application. once it has done so, the login screen appears so i login, after another long time of waiting it says "ERROR : The registry server is currently unavailable". so i then  try to login with the CLI using "appc login" and the same thing happens. i have tried to reinstall the CLI but when i use "appc setup" it says "Download server is not currently available".

   Hello [~alantbarlow], What version of node.js are you using? Try running? It must be a proxy on your network which casing the issue. Check your internet connection. I suggest working through wireshark with someone that manages the proxy to see if you can spot anything out. Reply with your findings. Thanks.</li>

   Wrong Alan.  You meant [~alantbarlow].

   I am using node.JS version 0.10.37. i am on my home network with no internet proxy, the last time i was able to use appcelerator studio without this problem i was using the same network.</li>

   if you can notice on the "Appcelerator Studio Error.png" the studio launcher icon doesn't even show up correctly. that error shows up no matter what password information i put in the login box because it isn't even checking it... it just has the "Signing In" loader going for 1-2 minutes, then displays that error. </li>

   Hello [~alantbarlow], Can you try reinstalling the studio and check. If that fails, then try installing Appcelerator CLI through Command Prompt. First uninstall the studio and run "npm install appcelerator -g" after that run "appc setup". Make sure you have proper Node installed by "node --version". Reply with your findings. Thanks.</li>

   Reinstalling doesn't work I've tried. Here are the steps I've just done....
   
    In command prompt I used "npm uninstall appcelerator -g", then I uninstalled appcelerator studio, uninstalled node.js, uninstalled GET, installed node.js from appcelerator.com, in command prompt I used "npm install appcelerator -g", then "appc setup" which recieved an error connecting to download server, I then tried using "appc use latest" which recieved an error, I then tried "appc login" and after trying to login it recieved the registry server error, I then installed appcelerator studio from appcelerator.com and with it installed GET, then tried to login to appcelerator studio and received an error I'm assuming for having special characters in my password, then put random letters in password box which got past the first error and tried to login but without even checking what I typed in it gave the registry server error...
   
   Just so you know I recently changed my password after already having this problem, my password used to work fine before I changed it but it still give the registry server error.</li>

   i have successfully resolved the problem, somehow the proxy settings have been changed in my appcelerator studio. I opened appcelerator studio and clicked on "Proxy Setup" and "Native" was selected as the active provider. i changed it to "Direct" and the program became unresponsive, after waiting for it to become responsive again, everything listed above works correctly except for the part with the password having special characters. but in terms of this bug report, everything has been successfully resolved.</li>
