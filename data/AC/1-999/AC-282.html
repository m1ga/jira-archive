<h3>Description</h3>

Ti.Map 2.3.# freezes (at least, that is what it appears to do) at random times. Sometimes it doesn't at all, sometimes it does after a long time, sometimes after a short time.

It does however not really freeze, as it only doesn't allow for user input, like swiping, pinching and clicking. Things can still be manipulated programatically. Only way to let user input happen again is re-open the window Ti.Map is in, as in: removing and re-adding the map view.

As described in Environment, it only appears to be happening with 2.3.# in combination with Ti SDK 3.5.1.

Opened GitHub ticket for it too: [<a href="https://github.com/appcelerator-modules/ti.map/issues/112" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator-modules/ti.map/issues/112</a>]

Example is simple:
<code><pre>
&lt;View id="mapview" module="ti.map" /&gt;
</pre></code>

In my case I have an annotation added, but this doesn't seem to have an effect.
<code><pre>
    var annotation = Map.createAnnotation({
        image : icon || '/images/icon_map_scout.png',
        latitude : 52,
        longitude : 6,
        title : "test",
        subtitle : "test",
        canShowCallout: false
    });
    
    $.mapview.addAnnotation(annotation); 
</pre></code>

Related tss:

<code><pre>
"#mapview[platform=ios]": {
    width: Ti.UI.FILL,
    height: Ti.UI.FILL,
    compassButton: true,
    userLocation: true
}
</pre></code>

   [~topener] we can not reproduce this issue, please try also with the latest SDK and map module version.

   Hi! As mentioned. It works with TiSDK 4+, and it doesn't bug out with Ti.Map 2.2. </li>

   [~topener] If this is not reproducible with the latest version, please migrate your app to use the latest SDK and latest Module version.
