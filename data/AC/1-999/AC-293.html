<h3>Description</h3>

I took over a project from another developer. I imported the project, cleaned and ran it. I got the following error:

[ERROR] :  Application not registered.
TRACE  | titanium exited with exit code 100
ERROR  | Error: ti run exited with error code 100
    at ChildProcess.<anonymous> (/Users/jackspiegel/.appcelerator/install/4.1.2/package/node_modules/appc-cli-titanium/plugins/run.js:84:66)
    at ChildProcess.emit (events.js:117:20)
    at Process.ChildProcess._handle.onexit (child_process.js:820:12)

   I am new to this so I am not sure what you are asking for. I described what I did (imported a project from another developer) , the steps I took (I imported, cleaned and then tried to run the project) and the error message i got:
   
   [ERROR] : Application not registered.
   TRACE | titanium exited with exit code 100
   ERROR | Error: ti run exited with error code 100
   at ChildProcess.<anonymous> (/Users/jackspiegel/.appcelerator/install/4.1.2/package/node_modules/appc-cli-titanium/plugins/run.js:84:66)

   Hi,
   I have overcome most of the issues and paid for a subscription but the production Setting is still locked. I can't find any help on this in the forums and my project is frozen I REALLY NEED HELP QUICKLY</li>

   Hi [~jmspiegel]
   You will need to logout and login again so that the system can give you the new profile settings:
   
   - Logout from Studio, clicking on your name in the bottom right corner
   - Go to the command line and type: appc logout â€“D
   - Re-open Studio, enter your credentials to log back in
   
   Then check your production setting. 
   
   And for the Application not registered error: 
   If you are in an indie or free plan just create a new project with the same name and replace the app or resource folder.
   
   Hope this helps.</li>
