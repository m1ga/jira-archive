<h3>Description</h3>

When I first created an Arrow app using the Arrow CLI, it automatically created two instances of ArrowDB - one for dev and another for production. These ArrowDB instances were accessible as "Apps" inside the Arrow App under the "Apps" section in the Arrow Dashboard. However, recent upgrade (or something) has caused these apps to disappear. Now, those ArrowDB instances are no longer available in the dashboard ANYWHERE.

Attached are screenshots to help explain the problem.

   [~parijatsahai] I've been trying to replicate this issue with no success, here're my steps:
   - Create an arrow app from CLI
   - Publish the app
   - Wait for it to be available
   - Hit the url
   - Wait until the app gets deactivated
   - Check the platform, the app us not active anymore
   - I still can see the ArrowDB instance in my apps
   - After 24 hours I still can see the ArrowDB instance
   
   Do you think that I'm doing something different than you?
   I'm using a developer account to test this

   It is possible that this issue doesn't exist for newly created Arrow apps. My Arrow app was created prior to the dashboard and Arrow platform upgrade. My guess is that the dashboard upgrade caused the old apps to break from this standpoint. You'll probably have to either find an old Arrow app to replicate the issue - you can use mine although it currently is "stuck" in build error that requires Appcelerator Support to intervene - or you'll have to find an old instance of Arrow platform, create an Arrow app there and then upgrade that instance to replicate the issue.</li>

   Just wanted to point out that when I went to the browser history, I was able to find the URL of the ArrowDB instance that used to be available prior to Aug 3rd (looks like around the time Arrow was upgraded). Interestingly, the same URL still works and I can view my ArrowDB app from that URL. However, the original problem remains that it is not visible under the "parent" Arrow app nor separately under the Apps list.</li>

   [~parijatsahai] are you still able to replicate this issue with the latest updates? please let me know

   The issue still remains. If you look at my Arrow app on the dashboard, you won't be able to find the corresponding ArrowDB app instance.

   Here is the url for the arrowdb instance:

   Did you try to access the URLs that I mentioned in the previous comment? How can you not reproduce it?</li>
