<h3>Description</h3>

During the use of Appcelerator Studio, I get prompted for log in at seemingly random intervals after executing a build to a device.  Since opening Studio today, I have not tried to open Appcelerator Studio on another computer, nor or execute a build on another computer, yet received the prompt shown in the attachment.

According to the console log, also pictured, my session has 'expired'. It shouldn't be, as I've only had Studio opened for approximately 2 hours on this lasted occurrence.  Also, my account is still active, and like I mentioned previously, I haven't tried to use the account on another computer.

Expected:
Don't prompt me for login in the middle of a session

Actual:
Prompts me to login for no reason.

I understand with SaaS there is a need to prevent the sharing of accounts, but I can't think of any case where this prompt would be effective in preventing that.

   Hello,
   
   Tested this issue. It's not a bug. When anyone remains idle using Appcelerator Studio for a long time, then automatically session has expired. After session expiration, studio prompts us for login to continue again.

   What is considered 'a long time'?</li>
