<h3>Description</h3>

Sometimes, not sure how exactly to reproduce it, Studio would crash and not reopen with the error from the title.

In order to fix it I tried:

Deleting the Library/Saved Application State/com.appcelerator.studio (or whatever that folder is called): it worked once.
Re-installing Appcelerator Studio from scratch: utterly frustrating, I can't reinstall every day the software.
How can this be fixed?
