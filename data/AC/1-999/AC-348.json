		"description": "Royal Bank of London may keep your login session active for longer but the Appcelerator Studio thinks it needs to bother the developers often. On a hectic Monday morning, I closed the studio by mistake.  I started it again and went out to grab a sandwich, thinking that the studio would be up and ready by the time I came back.  Nope, it wasn't.  It was instead showing that red brick dialog box asking me to enter my login credentials.  Damn!  I pulled some hair, said a curse word or two and entered my long user-name and password.  [There's a positive side to the frequency at which the studio asks you to login -- you'll remember your credentials no matter how long and cryptic they are.] Anyway, it took a few more minutes before the studio was ready for me to continue my complex debugging.  You'd think that the studio would keep its session active at least as long as it's running!  Nope, that's not the case either. \r\n\r\nThough it's just a nuisance, it makes me wonder if the product folks at Appcelerator really care for their developer community. Why does the studio have to refresh the session so often?  Appcelerator is an open-source company based on numerous open-source contributions, including from their developer community.  Granted, you have a company to run and the run rate is high.  We want you to succeed and make money through subscriptions and even strike it rich through an IPO or an acquisition. But please remember, the developers don't have an easier time with the product. The amount of time we spend scouring the forums to get answers on version compatibility issues, platform differences, and the ever-evading portability makes one wonder if the tool and framework are worth it.  Sometimes it gives me the feeling of being stuck between a rock and a hard place. So you will be better off not introducing any new irritants like this one.",
