<h3>Description</h3>

When building on a mac that has a case sensitive file system using 5.0.0 SDK, two build directories named build and Build are created in build/iphone directory. Also two info.plist files, one named info.plist and the other Info.plist are created. This then causes two ipa files to be created, one in each build dir, neither of which are valid. This is blocking and does not allow an app to be built. The solution would be to make sure all the references to build and info.plist are the same case in the build process. See the attached image to see what I am seeing. Using studio 4.3.0.201509151348. Trying to launch using iOS 9 simulator.
