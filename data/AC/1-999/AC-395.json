		"description": "We are creating application that helps people find a great partner to spend evening together. First app version will be for iPhone. \r\nThe important application feature – give users the ability to call without disclosing their real numbers. We have found Sinch SDK as a solution (https://www.sinch.com/docs/ios/user-guide/). \r\nWe are trying to use Sinch SDK and Titanium (http://appcelerator.com/). We cannot found SDK for Titanium and have created Titanium module based on this https://github.com/ludolphus/rebtel-sdk-titanium. We have used latest SDK from sinch.com - 3.4.2. \r\nWe can implement this solution for iPhones 5,6 – call quality is good. \r\nBut if one of the callers has iPhone 4/4s – call quality is very bad. \r\nWe have checked CPU usage on iPhone 4 (when calling), result is about 60% for Sinch+Titanium app, and about 25% for Sinch xcode sample app.\r\nWe think this difference is a cause of our problem. Now we trying to find workaround for this. \r\nIn our iPhone 5,6 is installed iOS8, this devices has high-performance vs. iphone 4 therefore we don’t have this problem.\r\nHowever if we test this case with two xcode app – call quality is good. \r\nLet us know if you have any ideas on it, thank you. \r\nDetailed problem description: \r\nTitanium and Sinch integration problem: call quality on iPhone 4s is very bad. \r\nEnvironment: \r\n- Titanium SDK 3.5.0, \r\n- Mac OS 10.9.4, \r\n- Xcode 6.1, \r\n- iPhone 4s with iOS 7.1.2. \r\n- Sinch SDK 3.4.2. \r\nHow to reproduce this issue: \r\n- Start first app on simulator, connect to Sinch and play any music on your MAC. \r\n- Start second app on iPhone 4, connect to Sinch and call first app. \r\n- Answer call in first app, on iPhone you can hear sound from your MAC. \r\nResult: sound is interrupted, call quality is very bad \r\n\r\nVideo example: http://youtu.be/nq8ztcNtiLc, also see attached logs. \r\nBut if we use xcode sample from sinch.com sound is good, example: http://youtu.be/mTvcpAqfz3E \r\nIf you follow link below you can found all sources for test app. The sources contain: Titanium test project, Sinch module in folder ModulesSrc and Sinch SDK 3.4.2. After build Titanium makes xcode project that contains in build folder. \r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/we5reayb972kbev/emptyproject.zip?dl=0\r\n",
