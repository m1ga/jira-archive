<h3>Description</h3>

Occasionally, and this is not rare but I don't know how to reproduce this, the application crashes in native code where the crash originates from libhwui.so. This is happening on various devices with different versions of Android. I've attached several log files with stack dumps of that issue - search for "SIGSEGV".
One of my prime suspects is view animations. Other suspect may be low memory condition. These are just guesses though, as I really don't know what causes it and how to deterministically reproduce this. All I can say that if you run the app long enough - it will happen.
We get these crashes on two different applications that we develop.

   I know it's hard to reproduce but can you include a (animation-heavy) test case that - if you run the app long enough - reproduces the issue for you?</li>
