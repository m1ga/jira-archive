<h3>Description</h3>

Description:
----------------
Originally, I created my app project and called it "wcguest".  My app works great and Push Notifications are received on both iPhone 6 and Apple Watch.  I then decided to change the App Name of my app and it appears there is an issue with the app name not getting updated in all locations necessary.


Steps to reproduce:
--------------------------
* I renamed my project (using Appcelerator Studio GUI) to "wait checkr"
* I opened tiapp.xml and updated '<name>wait checkr</name>'
* I opened manifest and updated '#appname:wait checkr'
* I cleaned my project / deleted build
* Deleted app from iphone
* Deleted Push Device Subscription in platform.appcelerator.com
* Pushed app to iPhone
* Opened app and re-subscribed to PUSH
* Sent PUSH message to device

----WORKS----
iPHONE:
* In Settings > app name is updated to "wait checkr"
* In Settings > Notifications app name is updated to "wait checkr"
* iPhone DID receive the PUSH notification and the app name on the PUSH Message shows the correct new name, "wait checkr"
WATCH:
* Watch > Notifications > app name is updated to new name "wait checkr"

----Does NOT WORK---
* Watch DID receive the PUSH notification.....BUT in the PUSH Message the app name still shows the old name "wcguest"
*

   Sorry, what exactly do you mean by test case?</li>

   [~amwinsauto] please review the documentation on how to submit a test case [here](<a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#</a>!/guide/How_to_Submit_a_Bug_Report-section-29004732_HowtoSubmitaBugReport-CreatingaTestCase)</li>

   My issue is with the "app name" displayed when receiving a PUSH message sent through Appcelerator (iOS) - ti.cloud.  Even if you had the app, how would you create a PUSH to then receive a Notification since that uses my Arrow DB and APNS Cert?
   
   The issue is where does Appcelerator get the "app name" to use in PUSH Notifications? That is not a configurable element inside AppC's "receive PUSH" methods....so it must be either pulling from the name of the Local Project, the last segment of the bundle ID, or the Arrow Project Name.
   
   I renamed my local project and deleted all the previous builds and that didn't fix the issue.  I suspect it is pulling from the Arrow Project name.  Is there a way to quickly rename the Arrow Project name to test?</li>
