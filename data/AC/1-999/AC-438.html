<h3>Description</h3>

Images in ListViews no longer load as they scroll onto screen, they now wait for the scrolling to finish before loading. Furthermore if the user scrolls without removing their finger from the screen and stops the scroll with their finger, instead of letting any inertia complete the scroll, then the image never loads.

This occurs in all Titanium SDKs (back to 3.5.1). It works correctly in XCode 6.1, but does not work in XCode 7.0

This may/may not be related information for AC-204

   [~martz256] Have you made sure to check the iOS9 App Transport Security? (docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#!/api/Titanium.Network)</li>

   Hi @hansknoechel The ATS was just left at Titanium default (i.e. a clean project) which is turned off i believe. I also tried enabling it which has exactly the same result.
   
   I assume that if ATS was an issue the image would never load? I can get all of my images to load, the non-loading is based on how the ListView is manipulated / touched, i can manipulate the ListView again to get them to load.
   
   e.g.
   1. Touch the bottom of the screen and scroll blank images into view. Ensure that the list is not moving as you remove your finger. The images will not load.
   2. Touch and move the list slightly, give the list a little inertia and ensure it is moving when you remove your finger. When the list stops moving the images will load.
   
   In XCode 6 the images loaded as soon as they appeared in the view, now they are waiting for the scroll to stop.
   
   If it would help for me to create a video of the issue I can do so.

   Hans, I have been doing a few more test to find out exactly when this happens and it seems that it is more of a Titanium SDK issue than as XCode one.
   
   *Works Correctly:*
   Ti SDK: 3.5.1
   XCode: 6.1
   
   *Does Not work Correctly:*
   Ti SDK: 4.0.0.GA, 4.1.1.GA, 5.0.2.GA
   XCode 6.1
   
   *Does Not work Correctly:*
   Ti SDK: 3.5.1.GA, 4.0.0.GA, 4.1.1.GA, 5.0.2.GA
   XCode 7.0.1
   
   I will now upload 2 videos... one which shows it working correctly and one showing the error. Note in the issue video that the images only load after I 'flick' the list and let it settle itself.

   [~martz256] This issue is related to TIMOB-19647 right? Just trying to find all issues we resolved with the fix.</li>
