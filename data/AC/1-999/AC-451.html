<h3>Description</h3>

I have recently upgraded to Xcode7 for the ios 9 support and after that I was trying to run my old app which I have created in Appcelerator SDK 4.1.2
Post discussion with one of the APPC team member I got to know that we should use SDK 5.0 for XCODE 7. But that still did not work.

Then I thought to try creating a TItanium app using command line 

<code><pre>
ti create -p ios -n sampleTitanium
</pre></code>

After running this command I got following options and I selected option# 1
<code><pre>
What type of project would you like to create?
 1)  Titanium App
 2)  Titanium Module
 3)  Apple Watch™ App
Select a type by number or name [app]: 1
</pre></code>

After hitting ENTER I get this error and which is weird
<code><pre>

   Hi [~shivanibhanwal],
   Make sure you have latest release version of CLI with "sudo npm install -g titanium” then “appc use latest"
   
   Once that step is done, check your CLI configuration with either "ti sdk" or   "appc ti sdk"  from the terminal. You are looking for what SDK is [selected]
   
   Make sure you have something selected. Preferably the same SDK you have set to build your project with.
   You can set the SDK with "appc ti sdk select" and choose from the list. Let me know if this works for you.</li>
</ol>
