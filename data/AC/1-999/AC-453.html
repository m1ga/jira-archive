I want to create a model based on several tables including multiple instance of the same table (PERSON) where different people serve different roles. So, there is one row for OFFICE_VISIT but then there are two joins to the PERSON table for 1) the patient and 2) the provider. 

I have been unsuccessful in defining a model based on multiple instances of the PERSON  table - Is there a way?


Because I was unsuccessful, I decided to create a view that includes all the tables in a join. The view works but Arrow refuses to build a model because there is no primary key.

   This was resolved with an unanswered question?
   
   The issue is that I can't create a model on a VIEW apparently because there is no primary key (on a view).

   Let me add that you can't create a composite model when the joined tables have multi-column primary keys.</li>
