<h3>Description</h3>

I have a app with the following flow:

app.js -> login.js -> intermediate.js -> firstPage.js -> Two Separate Location

Two Separate Location:

settings.js -> changedate.js
intermediate2.js
login.js has a login view (window). intermediate.js has no view but get some parameter from login.js and consume webservices pass data to firstpage.js. first.page has the main view one window with tagroup. then if i want to go to settings.js, it has a window with a tabgroup. then if want to change date i will go to changedate.js which has a window with tabgroup. now by changing date i want to go firstpage.js.

And i am done with this. But this causes memory leaks after 2 or 3 times of changing date (sometimes at first) as far as i observe. i did not remove any window, listener.
Now my questions is how to delete all previous window with tabgroup?? and expecting suggestions wha can i do??
