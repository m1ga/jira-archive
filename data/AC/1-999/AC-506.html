<h3>Description</h3>

If I use a signature file with signature algorithm SHA256withRSA script _build.js stores "SHA256withRSA" as sigalg parameter, the project build, but is impossible to install on older devices that exits with INSTALL_PARSE_FAILED_NO_CERTIFICATES error

As [documentation says](<a href="http://developer.android.com/tools/publishing/app-signing.html#signapp)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://developer.android.com/tools/publishing/app-signing.html#signapp)</a> -sigalg should always be "SHA1withRSA", so I modified line 828:


<code><pre>
t.keystoreAliases.push({
    name: m[1],
    sigalg: "SHA1withRSA"
});
</pre></code>


and it works (sigalg: "MD5withRSA" works too)

   Hello,
   
   Thanks for your query. Did to try to Package the app to the Android App Store from Studio or using  CLI command? Please provide the complete test case to reproduce this error.
   
   
   Thanks</li>

   From Studio. Just make a keystore, use it to build an app in Appcelerator Studio and try to install on a 4.2 device.</li>

   Hello,
   
   Thanks for your feedback.After some investigation, the following was realized: However, if you install the packaged app with the SHA256withRSA signature keystore onto a non-KitKat (< 4.4) device, then you will see the bug behaviour. Only a packaged app with a signed SHA1withRSA signature keystore can be installed onto a non-KitKat device.
   
   
   Thanks</li>

   It's not true. If you use a SHA256withRSA keystroke with "sigalg: SHA1withRSA" or "-sigalg MD5withRSA" it works on all Android version.
   
   I must use this method after users report the problem while installing on older devices because I can't change my keystroke for update policy reason.</li>

   same problem / solution in that </li>

   Same problem: TIMOB-16189</li>
<li>carlo 2015-12-10

   the duplicate TIMOB-16189 was closed without a solution
   my first ticket AC-267 was closed with a "can't reproduce" and I've added the info to do that
   I don't think duplicate again the issue is a good idea, but the bug is still present, what I can do?</li>
