<h3>Description</h3>

Hi,

after update:

I start RUN.  The console view flashes on bottom of right window repetitivly. After short time the build folder keeps empty. 

Here the log: <a href="https://gist.github.com/AppWerft/a3112fe69819f3440504" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://gist.github.com/AppWerft/a3112fe69819f3440504</a>

If reinstalled Studio after removing, I have relogined. Here the output of diagnostics:

Here the output of cli: <a href="https://gist.github.com/AppWerft/64a044c774b8646ab701" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://gist.github.com/AppWerft/64a044c774b8646ab701</a>

   I have copied from an other Mac a folder of appc studio (v4.1.0). If I start from this folder the same issue appears. I think the the reason of my issue don't come from the appc  folder. I guess the reason comes from dependencies (java/node …)?

   Hello [~titanium@webmasterei-hamburg.de], according to your CLI log it looks like your installation was successful. Did you try updating through studio? If so, sometimes this happens because the installation was broken down somehow though it will still shows successful installation. it's better if you try installing the previous versions and manually update to the latest through command prompt. Thanks.</li>

   Hello Sharif AbuDarda,
   
   first I have cleaned the "Appcelerator Studio" folder and reinstalled from new dmg download => same issue. Now I have installed the version from july (v4.1.0) => same issue. 
   
   I think it is a problem with other components. What of details do you need for help?
   
   I can trigger the issue by starting:
   /Window/ShowView/Other/Console inside Studio
   
   Best regards
   Rainer

   Solved!
   
   In workspace folder is a folder .metadata/plugins. Maybe in this folder is an issue. 
   I have created  a new Workspace and imported my project. It is fixed!
   
   I hope I can help other victims …</li>
