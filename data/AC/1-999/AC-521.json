					"body": "Hello [~danilo.sazonov@gmail.com], The reason behind your problem is in your new updated environment the device is not authorized by your PC. And it has a previous device id cache in it's memory. To resolve this, there are multiple steps you need to folow.\r\n\r\n1. Try to check and uncheck the USB Debugging option in the device. (if not working, try to unplug/plug the USB). At some point, the device should show up a message box to ask you if you authorize the computer. After you click yes, the device is then authorized and the connection is hooked. You should check that your USB connection type is MTP and NOT PTP.\r\n\r\n2. Restart the studio and do a clean building the project.\r\n3. Check if your device is online with pc through ddms tools in android sdk folder.\r\n4. Or, check through adb.\r\n5. You can run project through command \"appc run -p android -T device\".\r\n\r\nHere is some helpful link on your issue.\r\n\r\n[Link1|https://developer.appcelerator.com/question/177968/invalid---device-id-value]\r\n[Link2|https://developer.appcelerator.com/question/164219/invalid-device-id]\r\n[Link3|http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18011685/cant-connect-nexus-4-to-adb-unauthorized]\r\n[Link4|https://developer.appcelerator.com/question/160877/testing-with-galaxy-s4-device---adb-shows-serial-not-model]\r\n\r\nHope this helps, Thanks.",
