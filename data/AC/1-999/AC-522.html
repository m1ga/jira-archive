<h3>Description</h3>

Hi guys,
when I want to deploy my app to another Windows Phone(my client's device), I set Deploy-Windows Phone distribution to get appx. On my client's PC I installed Windows Phone 8 SDK with Visual Studio 2015 and tried to install the app via Windows Phone Application deployment(8.1). It fails with this error:
Deployment optimization failed due to an assembly that's not valid. Try to rebuilding the project and try again.
I tried to rebuild app for many times, tried to change Windos Phone Publisher ID to my client's but nothing worked. I tried to build to my phone with no problem. Also tried to install appx deployed successfully(with DEBUG suffix) to my phone to my client's phone with same error).
Can you please help me out? 
Thank you

   Hello [~max87], Can you try to run the project through terminal? Try running the project by
   
   <code><pre>
   appc run -p windows -C (--device-id)
   </pre></code>
   
   Please follow the [link](<a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#</a>!/guide/Appcelerator_Command-Line_Interface_Reference-section-43294287_AppceleratorCommand-LineInterfaceReference-WindowsBuildOptions) for running project through terminal.

   Hi Sharif,
   I think that running build from CLI won't help, because I need to install the app to a phone which is 200km from me.
   But I discovered, that *.appxbundle(not appx) works. It can be found at <path to project>\build\windows\phone.ARM\AppPackages\AppName\AppName_1.0.0.0_Debug_Test\AppName_1.0.0.0_ARM_Debug.appxbundle
   This file can be downloaded from server and installed to phone via Deployment tool(phone has to be connected to PC, unlocked screen, PC with Win 8.1, Visual Studio and Win Phone SDK Installed)</li>
