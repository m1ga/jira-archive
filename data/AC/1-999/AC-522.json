		"description": "Hi guys,\r\nwhen I want to deploy my app to another Windows Phone(my client's device), I set Deploy-Windows Phone distribution to get appx. On my client's PC I installed Windows Phone 8 SDK with Visual Studio 2015 and tried to install the app via Windows Phone Application deployment(8.1). It fails with this error:\r\nDeployment optimization failed due to an assembly that's not valid. Try to rebuilding the project and try again.\r\nI tried to rebuild app for many times, tried to change Windos Phone Publisher ID to my client's but nothing worked. I tried to build to my phone with no problem. Also tried to install appx deployed successfully(with DEBUG suffix) to my phone to my client's phone with same error).\r\nCan you please help me out? \r\nThank you",
