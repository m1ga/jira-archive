<h3>Description</h3>

I have come across an issue in the documentation when testing geolocation code in Android emulators.

I found the issue on this page: <a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#</a>!/guide/Tracking_Position_and_Heading

It describes how to use DDMS (the Dalvik Debug Manager) to set a custom GPS location. This turned out to be very unstable when I tried it - and following that I found that the recommendation today seems to be to use the "Android Device Monitor" ("monitor" program in the "android_dk/tools" directory).

Unfortunately, I don't think I am good enough at Android to update the documentation myself.

   Hello, 
   
   According to the Android documentation about [DDMS](<a href="http://developer.android.com/tools/debugging/ddms.html)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://developer.android.com/tools/debugging/ddms.html)</a>, One of the use of DDMS is to setting the location of the phone and AVD. "If your application depends on the location of the phone, you can have DDMS send your device or AVD a mock location. This is useful if you want to test different aspects of your application's location specific features without physically moving. The following geolocation data types are available to you". Appcelerator are following exactly this. [Android Device Monitor](<a href="http://developer.android.com/tools/help/monitor.html)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://developer.android.com/tools/help/monitor.html)</a> tools is a stand-alone tool that provides a graphical user interface for several Android application debugging and analysis tools.  Please provide links describing in details of using Android Device Monitor for Setting a Simulated Location in emulators. 
   Thanks.</li>

   Hi
   
   When I use DDMS I get the following warning:
   
   {{./ddms 
   The standalone version of DDMS is deprecated.
   Please use Android Device Monitor (tools/monitor) instead.
   }}
   
   and if I use "./monitor" I don't get the error - and I can still set e.g. position as is the example that the docs mention for using DDMS :-)</li>
