<h3>Description</h3>

In a widget I used an ImageView with multiple images, loaded by WPATH. It worked until version 5.0.2.
In my widget I have images "loading_x.png" inside assets/images.
The error is (it's evident that the path is wrong):
[ERROR] : couldn't load imageview image: /images/it.apra.tiimagegallery/loading_1.png at position: 0

I reproduced the bug in a empty project, you can clone it from my github repo: 
<a href="https://github.com/nonno/Ti.TestProject/tree/wpath-bug" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/nonno/Ti.TestProject/tree/wpath-bug</a> 
(you should click on the label)
I don't know why but a removeAllChildren called on the container where I want to put my images causes the problem, look in widget.js and try to remove the comment.
