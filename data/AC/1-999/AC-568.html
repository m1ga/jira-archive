   Hello,
   
   1. First check if there is already a submitted post of yours. 
   2. Check if there is already a content posted in there when you click submit and it's maybe trying to post another same content.  
   3. Try disabling Askimet.com anti-spam plugin in your browser, if you have that. I would  recommend disable Askimet and enable the other spam filters instead.
   
   Hope this helps, Thanks.

   Hi
   
   bq. 1. First check if there is already a submitted post of yours.
   1. How to do that?
   2. What to do next in case I haven't a post?
   3. What to do next in case I have a post?
   
   bq. 2. Check if there is already a content posted in there when you click submit and it's maybe trying to post another same content.
   I'm not sure I understand what you mean. I just enter a text as usual and press the submit button then. Nothing special.
   
   bq. 3. Try disabling Askimet.com anti-spam plugin in your browser ...
   Are you kidding me? Please, stop do that. The askimet is integrated into your web site, not into my browser:

   Hello, FYI, We are embracing Stack Overflow for Appcelerator Community Support. You are not able to create new topics any longer, only reply (e.g. with a link to your question as you've copied it to Stack Overflow). On February 1st the Q&A will be discontinued. Thanks.</li>

   As usual, you (not you personally, but the team) are doing things in a completely wrong way and don't care about your community and customers.
   You've flushed down the toilet "google-searchable" community data accumulated for several years. </li>
