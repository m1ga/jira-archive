<h3>Description</h3>

After updating the SDK to 5.1.2.GA, every <Button> inside a <ScrollableView> children view stops firing events. Tested on multiple environments using the same SDK version. 
Happens on both iOS 9.1 and 9.2.

Example:

<code><pre>
&lt;Alloy&gt;
	&lt;Window&gt;
		&lt;ScrollableView id="content&gt;
			&lt;View&gt;
				&lt;Button onClick="test"/&gt;
			&lt;/View&gt;
		&lt;/ScrollableView&gt;
	&lt;/Window&gt;
&lt;/Alloy&gt;
</pre></code>


<code><pre>
function test() {
    // this event is not triggered
    alert('testing');
}
</pre></code>

   Try to use zIndex on button and/or scrollableview. Also, probably some elements of layout overlaps thus blocking the button, maybe coloring of layout is your friend here. =)</li>

   Please close the issue. Seems like it's working on a newly created project.

   I had a similar problem yesterday and today with a <Label> inside a <ScrollableView> â€” click events were not being fired.
   
   Noting Rodolfo Perottoni's comment that a newly created project worked, I started anew and indeed the issue vanished.
   
   In the problem project, zIndex did not solve the problem nor did removing all other elements of the layout and simply coloring the background of the view.
   
   I can't identify anything I did that might have triggered this behavior, unfortunately. </li>

   It is indeed a random problem. 
   Sometimes it occur, sometimes it doesn't. 
   On new projects it works fine, but if you increase the complexity of the views inside your ScrollableView you'll eventually reach a point where all the children components of the ScrollableView will stop throwing events.</li>

   OMG, that's what is happening to me in SDK 4.1.1 with scrollable for a photo gallery and a "imageview" to show an X to close the gallery. Sometimes "onclick" is working, sometimes not. I also tried coloring but nothing unusual.
   
   It 's really strange.</li>

   Hi,
   
   I had the same problem and nothing worked but I did figure out how to reproduce this problem every time.
   
   The click event does not fire when running the application in Liveview.  Once I run it normally without Liveview the button fires as normal.
   
   Kind Regards</li>

   This bug is still a problem. Using TI SDK 5.2.2GA I have created a new project, used zindex, disabled liveview and nothing remedies the issue. Any SDK past 4.1.1 has image views, views, and labels that do not fire the click event if inside a view on a ScrollableView.</li>

   @Ben Scofield this bug was solved on 5.3.0.GA as far as i remember. I'm using 5.4.0.GA and the ScrollableView works just fine.</li>
<li>Ben Scofield 2016-09-08

   Thank, Rodolfo. I've tried 5.3.0 and still seeing the issue. The only thing I've yet to do is move to iOS 9.x and try with 5.4.0 GA. 
   
   I also just realized that this ticket was labeled alloy and I'm not using alloy on this project. I'd hate to think that was the issue.</li>
