<h3>Description</h3>

I had a few web url that play online music, I created an app and added those to a webView. When used the app on iOS (iphone or iPad) it worked fine and the music played. Also worked on my device Samsung S3 (Android version 4.3), but when tried running same app on Nexus 7 with Android version 5.1.1, it failed play the music on webView.

I also created an app using Android Studio to cross test if it was an Android issue, but with the same url and WebView component it worked fin on Android Studio on my Nexus 7 device.

I am attaching my app.js file to this ticket, hope that help you reproduce the issue.

   Hello [~ashishseb],
   
   I tested the issue with your provided test code. I was able to play the second webView url of your code : <a href="https://soundcloud.com/stroseoflima." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://soundcloud.com/stroseoflima.</a>
   
   *Device info:*
   Nexux 7: (Android version: 6.0.1)
   Ti.SDk : 5.1.2GA
   Appcelerator Studio, build: 4.5.0.201602170831
   
   Could you please test with the latest android version and let us know the update?
   
   Thanks.</li>

   Hi Jebun Haher,
   
   Thanks for a quick reply, I forgot to mention my TiSDK : 3.5.0. Do you have a fix for this version, I understand that I should use the latest SDK available but as the application I am working on is quite old and hasn't be update for quite a while, therefore for time being I need to stick to this SDK and find a fix for the issue.
   
   Thanks & Regards

   Hello [~ashishseb], Try using the latest SDK 5.1.2.GA. I have tested your app and it's working. Update your SDK, That's the only solution here. Closing this ticket. Thanks. </li>
