<h3>Description</h3>

When trying to do a brand new Alloy project using the template and changing no values, I get an error in the build process and [ERROR] Application Installer abnormal process termination. Process exit value was 1.

I've been trying to track down what the issue is, but have not been successful.  I managed to successfully build a Titanium project via Studio, but Alloy has failed for me each time I tried.  I also tried creating another brand new Alloy project in case there was something strange with the first setup, but still no luck.

I have attached the build error I was receiving.

   Hello, I tried to reproduce the issue but I wasn't able to reproduce the issue. Although the issue occur occasionally in my case. I recommend you to try the following steps as a administrative user:
   
   *Steps to do:*
   
   1.Make sure you have the latest Appc CLI from NPM: *npm install -g appcelerator*
   
   2.Uninstall alloy :
   
   <code><pre>
   
    npm uninstall -g alloy
   </pre></code>
   3. Install alloy again using the following command:
   
   <code><pre>
   npm install -g alloy
   </pre></code>
   
   4. Cache clean from NPM: *npm cache clean* 
   
   5.Create new alloy project and run again
   
   *Test Environments:*
   
   Appcelerator Command-Line Interface, version 5.1.0
   
   Titanium SDK  Version:5.1.2GA
   
   Appc Studio: Appcelerator Studio, build: 4.5.0.201602100611
   
   Mac OS X,Version                     = OSX EI Capitan 10.11.1</li>

   I did the appcelerator install, but the newest version that's available is 4.2.3-2.  I don't see a 5.1.0 version.  Is that correct?  Hmmm...I checked npm and it is 4.2.3-2, but at appcelerator.com it is 5.2.0-265  Why the difference there?</li>
<li>Gareth Arch 2016-02-21

   Oh, I think I see now...5.2.0-265 is the combination of all of the tools, but 4.2.3-2 is still that latest version of the the appcelerator CLI, right?</li>
<li>Gareth Arch 2016-02-21

   No, that did not work for me.  Even my appcelerator studio is only 4.4 (Because I'm on Windows I'm guessing?)</li>

   Hello,
