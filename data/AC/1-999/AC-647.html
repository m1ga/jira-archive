<h3>Description</h3>

Hi there,

Was working fine this morning on 5.1.2GA... I accepted today's 5.2GA update to the SDK, Studio and CLI. Seemed to install successfully.

Now I get 'build failed' on all 5.x SDK builds. Even ones which were working before.

4.0.0RC5 will build successfully.

Compiling directly to iOS devices - iphone 4s and iPad Mini on a Mac Mini

(The same code builds fine on Windows for Android with the 5.2GA update)


[INFO] : Optimizing .plist and .png files

   Hello,
   
   Thanks for sharing the issue. What do get when you build through terminal? Please run below command and let us know the update.
   <code><pre>
   appc run -p ios -T device  -C &lt;DEVICE_UDID&gt; [-V "&lt;DEVELOPER_CERTIFICATE_NAME&gt;"  -P &lt;PROVISIONING_PROFILE_UUID&gt;]
   </pre></code>

   Hi Jebun,
   
   I get exactly the same error when I build using the terminal.
   
   Thanks,

   Hello, Try running the "ti sdk select" in terminal and select the SDK 5.2.0.GA as selected sdk. Now, Run "ti info". Attach the output log as a text file in this ticket. 
   
   Go to the studio/view log file and attach the log as a text file in this ticket. 
   
   Please attach the necessary files. Thanks.
   </li>

   Hi Sharif
   
   The 'selected' SDK was already 5.2 but I've run the command all the same.
   
   I've attached the output and the log file as requested.
   
   Thanks for your time,

   Hello, looking to your Ti info outlog, it seems you have an invalid distribution provisioning profiles
   
   "Unable to find any valid iOS distribution provisioning profiles.
        This will prevent you from packaging apps for AppStore distribution.
        You will need to login into <a href="http://appcelerator.com/ios-dist-certs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://appcelerator.com/ios-dist-certs</a> with your Apple Download
        account, then create, download, and install a profile."
   Check your provisioning profiles in apple developer site. Also, this could be because of an error during your SDK update. Try manually updating the SDK 5.2.0.GA. Delete the SDK "Library/Application Support/Titanium/mobilesdk" in there and download the SDK through CLI "appc setup latest" and it will ask you to download the latest SDK 5.2.0.GA. 
   
   Thanks.</li>

   I was able to compile with my distribution certificate...but the app would not run on device..  If i downgraded Ti SELECT to previous version and downgrade to previous SDK..everything installs perfectly</li>

   Hi Sharif - Thank you for your reply
   
   ...but I can still build just fine using SDK 4.x?
   
   It was building for 5.1.2GA just fine until the update and now it won't even build for that.
   I was working the morning the update landed and used the update time to take a break... It then wouldn't build afterwards!
   
   At present there are only development certificates and I'm building for Dev not production.
   
   I'll try reinstalling the update now...
   
   Thanks again,

   Hi  Sharif,
   
   I can't find folders on anything like that path you've suggested:
   "Library/Application Support/Titanium/mobilesdk"
   
   I've searched for "Titanium" and "mobilesdk" as folders and they don't exist.
   
   There's nothing in the "Application Support" folder which relates to Appcelerator or Titanium.
   
   Thanks,
   
   Robin</li>

   Hello, 
   This directory is where the SDKs are stored in your mac. Look through your mac about the folder where mobile SDKs are stored. When you run "ti sdk list" this command in terminal it will list out the SDKs you have installed in your mac. There are directory listed of each SDKs. Go to that directory and Delete the SDK 5.2.0.GA in there and download the SDK through CLI, run "appc setup latest" and it will ask you to download the latest SDK 5.2.0.GA.
   
   Thanks.</li>

    I am having exactly the same problem, it looks like this is related to the Titanium Facebook module not being 64 bit - when before the update it was working fine.
    
    Appcelerator, could you please fix this please?I have a live app dependent on it!

    @Sharif Thank you... I've deleted the 5.2GA SDK and it still doesn't work using the previous one. I've reinstalled the  update and it still doesn't work.
    
    Last night I deleted and completely reinstalled the entire Appcelerator  Studio and it still won't build.
    
    @Samie -Amazing! That actually makes so much sense... I'm using the FB module in  my app and have been having trouble with the Android version too! I was going to raise a separate ticket... It will build for android (using my Windows machine for that) but the moment I call fb.authorize() it hangs!
    
    Both issues occurred immediately after installing the latest version of Studio and the 5.2 SDK.
    
    Both versions will build / work fine if I use a 4.x SDK though!</li>

    Thanks Sharif when will it be fixed? Sorry to be a pain but I am losing dev time over this. I am surprised that appcelerator released the ti.facebook module without compiling it as a 64 bit module.</li>
