   Hi Sharif,
   
   I couldn´t see any place here where attach a file.
   So, I sent it packed to your email.
   
   Thanks for your attention.

   Hello, I haven't got the file in the mail. Please attach the file here. Go to "More" tab at the top in here it will drop down some actions. Choose "Attach Files" and there you go. Thanks.</li>

   Hi Sharif,
   
   The minimum project I managed to compress was that I am fowarding, because the total in it has 64MB and I can attach only reaches 10 MB.
   
   I believe this can help.
   
   Thanks  </li>

   Hello, 
   
   I have tested the sample code you have attached. For me the error didn't happen for over 12000 sequential messages on Genymotion emulator Google Nexus 5 - Android 6.0.0. There was some assets missing in the sample project you sent. Can you try sending the full project through dropbox? 
   
   Thanks.</li>
