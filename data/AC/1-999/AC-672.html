<h3>Description</h3>

I am using a NavigationWindow for the iPhone / iPad version of my app. When I perform a "swipe to close" gesture on the app's base / home window the screen blocks and it's not possible do any other action.

Disabling "swipe to close" with setSwipeToClose(false) does not fix the issue.

   Hello, 
   I have tested that issue you reported. Swipe event is working as expected in home window using a NavigationWindow for the iPhone / iPad version of my app. You can take help [here](<a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#</a>!/api/Titanium.UI.Window-property-swipeToClose).
   
   *Testing Environment:*
   Appcelerator Command-Line Interface, version 5.1.0
   Titanium SDK  Version:5.2.0 GA
   Platform:  iOS
   Simulator: iphone 6/ iOS 8.0, iPad 2 / iOS 8.0
   
   
   .*Test Code:*
   <code><pre>
   
   Titanium.UI.setBackgroundColor('#000');
   
   
   
   var win2 = Titanium.UI.createWindow({
   
   backgroundColor : 'gray',
   
   title : 'Gray Window'
   
   });
   
   
   
   var win1 = Titanium.UI.iOS.createNavigationWindow({
   
   window : win2,
   
   swipeToClose : false
   
   });
   
   
   
   var win3 = Titanium.UI.createWindow({
   
   backgroundColor : 'blue',
   
   title : 'Blue Window',
   
   //swipeToClose : false
   
   });
   
   
   
   var button = Titanium.UI.createButton({
   
   title : 'Click here',
   
   color : 'red',
   
   });
   
   
   
   win2.add(button);
   
   
   
   button.addEventListener('click', function(e) {
   
   Ti.API.info('Click event fired');
   
   
   
   win1.openWindow(win3, {
   
   animated : true
   
   });
   
   
   
   });
   
   
   
   var button2 = Titanium.UI.createButton({
   
   title : 'Click here',
   
   color : 'red',
   
   });
   
   
   
   win3.add(button2);
   
   
   
   button2.addEventListener('click', function(e) {
   
   alert('Click event fired');
   
   
   
   });
   
   
   
   win1.open();
   
   
   </pre></code>
   
   *Test Result:*
   <code><pre>
          [INFO] :   Click event fired
   
   </pre></code>
   
   
   
   *Steps to Test.*
   
   Firstly you have to create a project then copy the sample code and run the project. After running the project so you can see a gray color window and click on “ *Click here*” then blue color window will open. After open blue color window, You will swipe and click on “*Click here*"</li>

   Hi Aminul, thank you for your response. I tested the code you provided in a new project as suggested. But I am getting the same behaviour as in my project / app. I did the following actions:
   
   <h4>Started app -> <code>Gray Window</code> is shown</h4>
   <h4>Did a swipe to close on <code>Gray Window</code></h4>
   <h4>Clicked <code>Click here</code> on <code>Gray Window</code> -> Click event is fired but <code>Blue Window</code> does not show up and <code>Click here</code> is disabled</h4></li>

   Hello,

    *Test Environments:*
   <code><pre>
   Appcelerator Studio, build: 4.5.0.201602170821
    Command-Line Interface, version 5.2.0
   OS. Version                     = 10.11.3
   Node.js
     Node.js Version             = 0.12.7
     npm Version                 = 2.11.3

   Hi Mostafizur,
   please notice that you have to do a swipe to close on the <code>Gray Window</code> and click on <code>Click here</code> afterwards to reproduce the issue.
   
   The test case you described (open the <code>Blue Window</code> and swipe to close there) works for me too. But as I wrote, you have to do the swipe to close on the <code>Gray Window</code> even if you can't close this window like that, because it is the root window.
   
   I attached the project I tested the code you provided with (test.zip) as well as a screenshot after I did a swipe to close on the <code>Gray Window</code> and clicked on <code>Click here</code>. As you can see, <code>Click here</code> is disabled but the <code>Blue Window</code> isn't opened. 
   
   Here are my environment details:
   {noformat}
   Appcelerator Studio, build: 4.5.0.201602170831

     Node.js Version = 0.12.7
     npm Version = 2.11.3

   Simulator: iphone 5s / iOS 9.2
   Java Development Kit Version = 1.7.0_79 / 1.8.0_40 (tested both)
   Xcode version  7.2.1

   Hello [~saschbro], 
   
   I have tested the issue that [~mrahman] provided. I have followed your steps. After the app opens I did a swipe to close gesture in the first window (gray window) and then I click "click here" to open the second window (blue window). Here blue window opens as expected. Now, in the code if I set "swipeToClose : true" in the gray window in NavigationWindow. I can reproduce the issue that you described. But, If I set "swipeToClose : false", The issue did not occur. 
   
   Here is my test environment
