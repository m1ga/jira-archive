<h3>Description</h3>

I have lost my titanium account password (raysweb@gmail.com) and recovered the account on Nov. However the system show my account joined as Nov 2015 and could you help to activate my indie seat. 

I have joined titanium since 2013 and published free app using titanium. I really need this indie seat to continue my development. Please help to activate it. I have sent another email to 	support@appcelerator.com for prove.

Thanks for your attention and appreciate for your help.

   Hello,
   
   Unfortunately the window for claiming free Indie seats has closed. There were two steps: first, you needed to have signed up to the Platform by June 30, 2015. Second, you needed to claim your Indie seat by Sept 30, 2015 from the Platform billing page. Since you haven't done the second one. There is not much we can do for you at this moment. You have to choose a paid play if you want to continue your development with Appcelerator. 
   
   Thanks.</li>
</ol>
