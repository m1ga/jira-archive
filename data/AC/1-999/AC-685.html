   Hello, I tried to reproduce the issue with LiveView enabled, I wasn't able to reproduce the issue. Although the issue occur occasionally in my case. Try cleaning the project and rebuilding with LiveView enabled. Make sure you are not connected through proxy. Also, if you are using any modules with your project the error "Couldn't find module: localeStrings for architecture: x86_64" is because you have no 64bit support for the module. Try running "ti -64" in the project terminal. Thanks.</li>

   i did there is not issue with modules!
   
   all module has 64 bit support
   
   did you checked the appcelerator studio log why i get these two Errors? may be that what causing the issue!

   Hello, What version of Ti SDK are you using? Try the latest stable version 5.1.2.GA. Go to your studio help and click Either check for Appcelerator updates or check for updates. Download and install the recommended updates. Restart the studio and clean the project. Make sure the PC and the device is in the same network. Thanks.</li>
