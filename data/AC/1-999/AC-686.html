<h3>Description</h3>

With the sdk 5.1.1 GA the annotations don't work correctly. 
I can add them in the map but the event listener "click" doesn't work, in fact if I try to click the annotation nothing happens. Also the rightButton,rightView or the leftView,leftButton and the custom pin image don't work.
With the sdk 6.0.0.v20160206012308 only the click works (partly) in fact if I click it, in the event listener click function I can display only alert or console log. If I  try to display in console the event object the app crashes.

I've created an application "for example" that includes the map only and in addition the annotations from a db test.
With the sdk 5.1.1 GA it works out, but with the last 6.0.0.v20160206012308 it freezes.

Waiting for your reply,
I thank you in advance.
Kind regards,
Enea

   Hello,
   
   Thanks for your report. This is not a bug, but can be considered as a feature request. Map is not yet available for windows.
