<h3>Description</h3>

I had two project with alloy framework and both using same database structure. Currently i didn't define the sqllite database name for the models and these two project is totally separate app. The problem is the data will overwrite each other app when two apps are install in same mobile device. So, is there any way to modify the default db name for the model in order to let two app run in same device without overwrite each other data.

   Hello,
   
   Thanks for sharing  with us. What is your alloy version? Are you using latest builds? It would be better if you can share a sample test case, test steps to reproduce the issue. I also suggest you to share your environment details. To do this, please open terminal type: *appc info*.
   
   
   Thanks</li>

   Hello, Currently this is not possible with Appcelerator. You will need two separate databases for separate apps. </li>
