Our iOS devices have recently stopped receving push notifications.
We know it worked 03.18.2015.

   Hi,
   
   Would you please send me your app key and push id (which is not received, you can find it in web console). I will check that for you from our backend.
   For security season, please send those info to my email: sliang@appcelerator.com
   
   Regards,
   Shuo </li>

   Please provide the latest push id(try send new one if it is ok), since the old one is really hard to track. 
   
   And On the other hand, please check if your certificate expired.
