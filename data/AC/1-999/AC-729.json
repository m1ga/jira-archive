Click on Open Blue Window.\r\n2.Alert dialog will appear, click on Confirm.\r\n3. Second window In blue color will get open.\r\n4. On second window on top right navigation bar click on \"Open third window\"\r\n5. On 3 window with pink color will get open, click on \"Close pink window\"\r\nNow when you go back to second window, second window focus will not fire, and then you navigate to first window, first window focus will not fire.\r\nEven the application will get hang, all the buttons will stop working and even next window doesn't get opens up on click of \"open click window.",
