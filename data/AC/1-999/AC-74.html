<h3>Description</h3>

The last few days I've been busy importing my old projects to the new Appcelerator Studio IDE and almost everything went as planned. Everything runs fine on the iPhone Simulator and the transition to the new Arrow Cloud went perfectly, I only ran across one (fatal) problem;

Every time I try running an app on my (physical) iPhone 5s I get an error when the app starts up, I get the red error popup with the text 'Failure loading the application assets' and in the console it logs '[ERROR] : Script Error Failure loading the application assets.' I've never had this problem on the Simulator (and still don't), it occurs with every app and only in the Appcelerator Studio IDE (not in Titanium Studio).

It seems to be caused by loading custom modules, for example: When I run the standard Blank Canvas app from the studio, it runs perfectly fine on the iPhone, but as soon as I require (for example) the dk.napp.imageview module to the app it throws the error.

I was asked by Fokke to enclose this link (throws a 404 for me, but maybe not for everyone): 
"Error source:

<a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/appc-cli-titanium/blob/d7dd61146ada824926348f5cbfd1ce664ba01154/support/ios/ApplicationRouting.m#L125" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/appc-cli-titanium/blob/d7dd61146ada824926348f5cbfd1ce664ba01154/support/ios/ApplicationRouting.m#L125</a> "

Thanks in advance!

   I'm having a similar issue, it errors right when it hits the Ti.Maps module.</li>

   [~seanhs] This should have been resolved in appc-cli@0.2.244. What version are you using?</li>
<li>Klaas Schoenmaker 2015-04-19

   Currently on 0.2.242, will update and try again</li>

   I've upgrade from 0.2.230 to 0.2.255 resolving the issue. It does still generate an unexpected warning.
   
   <code>[WARN]  couldn't find file dk_napp_drawer_js</code>
   
   Which refers to the dk.napp.drawer module, which is loaded using a require. The app works as expected though.</li>

   Hello [~klaasscho98], Are you still having the issue? If you do facing the issue in latest studio build Appcelerator Studio, build: 4.1.1.201507141126 with SDK 4.1.1.GA, please provide a sufficient test case so we can reproduce the issue. Also if you are using third party module in your application please provide the module link. Thanks.</li>
