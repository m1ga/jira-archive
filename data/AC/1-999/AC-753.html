<h3>Description</h3>

When you go to appcelerator.com and click the github icon to sign up for Appcelerator Platform, you get prompted to sign into github. 
From there, you are directed to <a href="https://platform.appcelerator.com/api/v1/auth/github/undefined" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://platform.appcelerator.com/api/v1/auth/github/undefined</a> and see

This is causing bad user experience and PR.

As a training partner ( the only USA one at the moment) and community member, this is bad. Please fix this or remove that feature. 

While we are at it, this should be a different ticket: <a href="https://twitter.com/spsrich/status/705831080457162752" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/spsrich/status/705831080457162752</a>

   I just went through the GitHub signup flow with 2 accounts:
   
   1. GitHub account tied to an email address not associated with the platform
   * For this account the signup flow worked with no issues and the platform account was created
   
   2.  GitHub account tied to an email address that has a platform account
   * For this account the signup flow logs me into the platform account associated with the email, *but* I am redirected to <a href="https://platform.appcelerator.com/api/v1/auth/github/undefined" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://platform.appcelerator.com/api/v1/auth/github/undefined</a> rather than <a href="https://platform.appcelerator.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://platform.appcelerator.com/</a> after authorising through GitHub</li>

   Ah, other issue is <a href="https://twitter.com/spsrich/status/704427634407571459." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/spsrich/status/704427634407571459.</a> It is almost impossible for me to guess what the issue is there without more info. [~shossain] want to try reaching out on that one?</li>

   I'm not having any issue with it.</li>

   @sdavenport @ingo So the behavior I am seeing now is if you have an account and whether or not you are logged into github, it ultimately works but fails on new accounts.
   In other words lets take three scenarios 
   
   Scenario 1) you are logged into github already (and already have an Appcelerator Platform account)
   
   Given you are logged into github
   When I go to appcelerator.com 
   And I  click on the github icon 
   Then I am logged into Appcelerator Platform (dashboard.appcelerator.com)
   <h4>this scenario works</h4>
   
   Scenario 2) You are not logged into github, but your github account is associated with an Appcelerator Platform account
   
   Given you are not logged into github
   When I go to appcelerator.com
   And I click on the github icon
   Then I am prompted to log into github
   Then on successful login I am redirected to dashboard.appcelerator.com
   And successfully logged in.
   <h4>this also works</h4>
   
   Here is what fails:
   Scenario 3) I have a github account that is not signed up with Appcelerator Platform
   
   Given I have a github account
   And have never signed up for Appcelerator Platform
   When I go to appcelerator.com
   And I click on the github icon
   And I log into my github account
   And I authorize Appcelerator to access my github
   Then I get the following error
   
   {"success":false,"description":"The server has encountered an error. Please try again, or contact support.","code":500}
   
   From this url:
   <a href="https://platform.appcelerator.com/api/v1/auth/github/login?code=f222b6c7e99b195234d3&state=AxuzWnR27uVEtqeNVjUCOJRezNDug0m0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://platform.appcelerator.com/api/v1/auth/github/login?code=f222b6c7e99b195234d3&state=AxuzWnR27uVEtqeNVjUCOJRezNDug0m0</a>
   
   I don't know if pasting this is exposing any private data, so we might want to make this ticket no longer viewable by all users.
   
   To be fair:
   When I open a new tab and go back to appcelerator.com and click the github icon again.
    I am presented with a confirm Appcelerator account page.
   Once I fill out that form I am presented with a "trial mode"
   
   There might be some need to further QA that github integration, because I should have never seen that error. I imagine most people aren't going to think.
   "I just got an error. I'll go back and try this again". Instead, they are going to rant on github and previous community members will like and or retweet.
   
   TL;DR: this: <a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/orcvOtbTCjE/maxresdefault.jpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://i.ytimg.com/vi/orcvOtbTCjE/maxresdefault.jpg</a>
   So yes, it works, but there still seems to be a sporadic error that comes up.
   
   I created a brand new github account and appcelerator platform account to run through this.

   [~codexlabs] Thank you for the update! Can you clarify when exactly you retested this? I ask because we did make fixes yesterday in APPTS-8464 at around 1PM PST.</li>
<li>Nathan Boxhall-Burnett 2016-03-06

   [~sophrinix], Your scenario 3 is working as expected for me since the fix was put in place yesterday, using a brand new GitHub and Appcelerator Platform account. Are you still able to reproduce the issue?</li>
<li>Andrew McElroy 2016-03-06

   When I reported those three scenarios 11 hours ago, give or take 20 minutes was when I was testing those scenarios.
   
   As for reproducibility. I just now retested it with a new github account and it works. This can be closed.</li>
