<h3>Description</h3>

Hello All, 

Following is the issue I am facing:

1) I am using Winows 7 OS and installed Titanium
2) Imported Titanium project from github by giving the address for the github repository. 
3) Changed the project natures to Mobile(Primary) and selected Alloy, Mobile Web as well
4) Closed the project and opened it again.
5) Have installed the Android SDKs 5.0.1, 4.4, 4.3.1, 2.3 and configured the location of the same in Titanium
6) Even following the above mentioned steps the Run and Select Project Button in Titanium remains disabled. 

Please suggest the fix. 

Regards
Jatin

   HI,
   
   What will happen if you create a new app, not just import one? Does it run well?

   Hi Shuo, 
   
   Thanks for querying back. 
   
   Yes, new projects were running fine. 
   
   I identified that .project file was missing when the code was checked out from the git repository. I created a new Mobile Project, which generated the .project file. I copied that file to the project code checked out from the repository and then imported the project as "Existing Projects in Workspace". This time titanium identified the .project file. Then I changed the nature of the project by going into Properties >> Project Natures >>Mobile-Primary and then closed and opened the project and it then enabled the RUN and SELECT PROJECT.
