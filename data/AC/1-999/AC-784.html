   Hi,
   
   I checked the database from our backend. When you send push notification, Google GCM send back a error message. "NotRegistered". 
   
   Here is the detail about this problem. 
   "If it is NotRegistered, you should remove the registration ID from your server database because the application was uninstalled from the device or it does not have a broadcast receiver configured to receive com.google.android.c2dm.intent.RECEIVE intents." Ref: [<a href="https://developer.android.com/google/gcm/http.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://developer.android.com/google/gcm/http.html</a>]
   
   Which means something wrong with your device token or you may delete the app from the device, So I will suggest you that re-install your app and subscribe the device again. Then keep doing testing for push notification. 
   
   Please feel free to let us know if you still have this problem.
   
   Regards,
   Shuo</li>
