		"description": "As far as I know due to the upgrades to the Titanium SDK there are three ways to hide the action bar on Titanium:\r\n\r\n1. Calling window.activity.actionBar.hide() when the window opens\r\n2. Changing the global app theme to hide the action bar for all the windows\r\n3. Feeding in a custom theme when creating the window through the Titanium createWindow() method.\r\n\r\nNeither of these ways is an option for me, and this is why (for each of the ways):\r\n\r\n1. The action bar appears for a split second before it disappears, i.e. the action bar isn't already hidden when the window opens\r\n2. Some of the windows in my app use the action bar, some don't. Thus, this all or nothing solution isn't an option.\r\n3. The windows are created/opened through the Alloy MVC framework (by creating Alloy controllers), not the createWindow() method. Thus, this isn't an option either.\r\n\r\nThus, I was wondering if there was another way to hide the action bar such that it doesn't appear for a split second when the window is opened.",
