<h3>Description</h3>

I face reproducible crashes on iOS device (iPhone 6). I achieved to isolate the javascript piece of code that causes crashes, however I think it could be a framework's bug as it raises error at memory access level. 

Here is the code: I have a widget with multiple controllers - it's a typical list/item structure, let's call the files as <code>myWidget/controllers/widget.js</code> and <code>myWidget/controllers/item.js</code>. In <code>widget.js</code> file I run 
Widget.createController('item', {foo: 'bar'});
thus the code from the <code>item.js</code> file is required and executed. 

*_Sometimes_* during the execution of my app, in which my widget is required in several different places, the <code>arguments</code> variable inside the <code>item.js</code> controller happen to be erroneously instantiated, causing the app to crash at the first reference to such variable. 
By investigating in logs, the crash is related to a bad access to memory: a <code>NSRangeException</code> error is raised, resulting in a <code>EXC_BAD_ACCESS</code> memory fault and consequently an app crash. 

I attach both the error log in console and the crash report in xcode. 

I hope this story results clear and helpful, please let me know if I can do anything to help.

Thanks
