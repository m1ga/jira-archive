<h3>Description</h3>

In the previous versions, after clicking 'debug', we had to wait for the app to start on the device, and then click the name of the app in the debug list or choose this log in the console window. 

Annoying as this was, it sort of worked (as long as there is no suspend, then you have to click to the suspended thread just to resume it - why is that?).

In the new version, the App log is always empty, and the output of Ti.App.log etc is visible when we choose 'device'. The full device log is no longer visible, so we need Android Monitor for it (if that is not broken by the last Titanium update).
