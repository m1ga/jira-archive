   Hi,
   
   Did studio display any information to tell you that update success. and maybe you can try close the pop out page with installation and do update manually. See whether the problem still there.

   Hi, 
   
   Actually Yes. After update there's a standard monit saying Sdk, cli, node and alloy were updated. However if i restart studio, it asks for updates again.
   In cmd Commander line alloy, or titanium  are working fine, but if i choose not to update, the studio won't allow me to create new alloy project.
   
   I'm using 64bit architecture. </li>

   Can you try to update SDK, CLI, Node and Alloy manually, Ref: <a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#</a>!/guide/Updating_the_Current_Version
   After this, see whether this problem still happen.</li>

   Checked. After installation of updates afer restart, when i manually check for updates, studio lists them again. I think that this has something to do with root rights, as update asks for them. Then Studuo creates "root's password" folder on my desktop... why??? when i was about to remove this folder from system without sudo, i got listed links to files like:
   Desktop/root's password:/home/user/Desktop/root's password:/home/user/Desktop/root's password:/home/user/Desktop/root's password:/home/Desktop/Titanium_Studio/root's password:/home/user/Titanium_Studio/root's password:/usr/lib/node_modules/alloy/widgets/com.appcelerator.buttongrid/docs/img/header.png
   For me it's wrong that studio does a thing like that... </li>

   Hello [~tkrz]!
   
   Please remove openJDK and use Oracle's JDK 6. Check the docs:
   
   <a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#</a>!/guide/Setting_up_Studio-section-37540095_SettingupStudio-OracleJDK
   
   Excerpt: 
   
   Linux Desktop
   6 (aka 1.6) rev 10
   8 latest revision
   32-bit and 64-bit
   Official Website
   This package must be installed to launch Studio on Linux systems.
   If using the 64-bit JDK, the ia32-libs package is required.
   
   
   Best Regards! </li>

   Hi Mauro,
   
   I am pretty sure that i have installed oracle JDK, however it was v7. I'll try to check if change to JDK6 will have any efect, but it could take a while since i deleted linux from my pc and at last successfully run Ti Studio on my win7. Now I'll need to rebuild the environment.
   
   Best Regards.</li>
