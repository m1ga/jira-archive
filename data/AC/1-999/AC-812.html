<h3>Description</h3>

Today, we found a critical bug about posts query result.
But yesterday it work properly.
Production and Development ACS has same problem.

ACS id : 9296c7e5-fe54-4502-a600-0757a581a7bf

<h4>Reproduce step</h4>
1. request query for posts (via 'ti.cloud' module or rest api)

<h4>Expected result (work properly until yesterday)</h4>
Every post object has user object.

<h4>Actual result (This occur from today morning)</h4>
Some posts has user object, some post has only user_id as string instead of user object.  
Please check attached json file which is actual result of my 'Bogoyo' ACS account(id:9296c7e5-fe54-4502-a600-0757a581a7bf)

In addition to that, acs management page (<a href="http://cloud.appcelerator.com/9296c7e5-fe54-4502-a600-0757a581a7bf/posts)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://cloud.appcelerator.com/9296c7e5-fe54-4502-a600-0757a581a7bf/posts)</a> show edit button of some posts. (screenshoot attached)

   Whqts your app key</li>
<li>Wei Kong 2014-03-12

   what's the json_depth_level you are using? the user_id is for photo object which is one level deeper. I see all the post objects with user object</li>
<li>Wei Kong 2014-03-12

   Actually I am able to reproduce the issue</li>

   yes, i can reproduce the following issue and is investigating:
   "
   post_id in Production.
   
   531f6741da5ba0076e0050df
   531417b6da5ba00766004025
   5310300eda5ba0076600379d
   When you query without where, you can't get these posts event per_page 100000.
   But with query with where or show method, you can get these!!

<li>Xuefeng Zhang 2014-03-13

   [~yomybaby],i am investigating this issue.</li>
<li>Xuefeng Zhang 2014-03-13

   [~yomybaby], i have added my comments for TC-3890, it is not ACS issue, it is due to the photo was not processed, after the photo was processed , we can see the urls.</li>
<li>Wei Kong 2014-03-14

    [~yomybaby] For the missing 3 posts, you have two custom fields which are longer than 1024k so it is not indexed properly. This is a mongodb limitation. and we are working with thme to come up a workaround </li>
<li>Ritu Agrawal 2014-03-17

    [~yomybaby] Thank you for reporting these issues. Much appreciated. We have deployed fixes for these issues in the production environment so please verify all of your reported issues and let us know if you any issue persists or if you see a new issue.</li>
