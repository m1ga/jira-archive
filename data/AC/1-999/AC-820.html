   Can you please:
   
   1. Confirm 3.4.0 is the "selected" SDK on the CLI. <code>ti sdk select</code> from the command line
   2. Paste/Attach a screenshot that shows exactly what you are seeing.</li>
<li>Rene Cabrera 2014-09-23

   Attached are screenshots showing that iOS SDK is not being found and the configuration is based on appcelerator documentation.</li>

   Hello [~renecabrera]: 
   
   Did you open Xcode at least once? You need to accept the license before actually using it. 
   
   Best Regards! </li>
<li>Rene Cabrera 2014-09-24

   Yes, I opened Xcode a few times and I still have the issue.</li>
<li>Rene Cabrera 2014-09-25

   Any addition thoughts or findings?</li>
<li>Ingo Muschenetz 2014-09-25

   Can you please provide the output of <code>ti info</code> from the command line?</li>
<li>Rene Cabrera 2014-09-25

   Attached is the ti info output.</li>

   Looks you have all the latest components required for launching mobile app onto iOS8 simulators : 3.4.x versions of Studio/SDK/CLI and 3.4.x SDK is selected as default ('ti sdk' command will confirm this), XCode6 is the default selected one and SDK in TiApp editor is set to 3.4.x.
   
   It is weird that even in this case, the XCode installation is not detected on your machine. One of the possible failures could be Studio is using the old cache output from CLI and still referring to that for XCode path. I would like to try a couple of options and give us additional set of diagnostic information for further investigation :
   
   - Can you close Studio and then, delete/rename the folder <workspace_location>\.metadata\.plugins\com.appcelerator.titanium.core and then, restart Studio. This will eliminate the chance of the old CLI cache in case if we were using it.
   - Switch to a new workspace.
   - Enable the debug level to All in Preferences > Studio > Troubleshooting. Clear existing log files (Help > Studio > Clear log file). Press Refresh button in iOS preference page and give us the workspace logs (Help > Studio > View log file).
   - Output of "xcode-select -p" command.
   </li>
<li>Rene Cabrera 2014-09-26

   Below is the out put of xcode-select -p
   /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
   
   I have also attached the new log file called new_log.txt.</li>
<li>Ingo Muschenetz 2014-09-26

    This seems very suspicious:
    
    permission denied: /Users/Rene/Library/Application Support/Titanium/mobilesdk/osx/3.4.0.v20140922135716/manifest.json
    </li>
<li>Rene Cabrera 2014-09-26

    I did see that in the log file. 
    Thoughts?</li>
<li>Rene Cabrera 2014-09-26

    Any news?</li>
<li>Praveen Innamuri 2014-09-26

    [~renecabrera] Couple of things :
    
    - I didn't see any details related to refreshing iOS SDK from the preference page. Did you enable the logging level to All (as I asked in my previous comment) and then, refresh iOS SDK in preferences ?
    - We did see a lot of permissions denied errors to manifest.json file while accessing the SDK. Though it might not related to the current problem, I would like to see the results after fixing the permissions on this file.</li>
<li>Ingo Muschenetz 2014-10-20

    [~renecabrera] Once you have time to add additional information, we'd be happy to take a look.</li>
