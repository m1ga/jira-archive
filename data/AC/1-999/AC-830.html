<h3>Description</h3>

I had a project running on Android and IOS. 
On my windows computer, I imported the projet from Titanium to Appcelerator studio and it was fine. I can build the project for Android.
Now I want to build it on my Mac for IOS. I imported the "converted" project from github and always get the same error :
{{[INFO] :   Processing JavaScript files
[INFO] :   Processing Titanium namespace resources
[INFO] :   Compiling localization files
[INFO] :   Checking for Splash Screen localization

    at ChildProcess.emit (events.js:117:20)
    at Process.ChildProcess._handle.onexit (child_process.js:820:12)
}}
It's fine when I run a sample project.
I have no idea what's wrong...

   Hello,
   
   I tested the issue you reported. But migrated project is built here successfully.
   
   So I recommend you
   1. Upgrade studio and SDK to the latest build.
   2. Check your tiapp.xml file and compare it to the default one.
   
   Alos check this migration link: <a href="https://web.appcelerator.com/product/migrate-app" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://web.appcelerator.com/product/migrate-app</a>
   
   If anything does not work, you can replace your "App" or "Resource" folder to the new project.
   
   Then let us know if you get the error again.
   
   Thanks.</li>

   anything new here ? 
   I can't build my app.... should I create a new project from scratch ? I'm just afraid apple won't recognize the former app to be the same.</li>
