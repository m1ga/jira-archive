<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Steps to Reproduce</h4>
Crashing is one thing we could tolerate but freezing is another thing that is seriously very frustrating as it renders all the device button unusable!
It is very hard to reproduce the case because the code been usesd are perfectly okay and run fine but this freezing, when opening a window, occasioanlly occurs at random.
After a thorough analysis, it has come to our attention that the freezing occurs after these system logged message (but not always , as this case is very hard to reproduce) -

NOTE: The memory logs figure in the info below are not system accurate but a rough estimation i put myself which was recorded when the last freeze occurs !

[INFO] :   I/dalvikvm-heap: Grow heap (frag case) to 51.156MB for 155148-byte allocation
[INFO] :   I/dalvikvm-heap: Grow heap (frag case) to 51.289MB for 155148-byte allocation
[INFO] :   I/dalvikvm-heap: Grow heap (frag case) to 51.437MB for 155148-byte allocation
[INFO] :   Choreographer: Skipped 170 frames!  The application may be doing too much work on its main thread.


The window and evrey bit of its UI components plus the app turns into a black screen and remain frozen including the device button!
The freeze occurs only when trying to open a seperate window and probably after the app has been used for a long time, or the app is exited ( via back button and not by termination via force stop or  killing it via multitasking bar) and trying to get it back on to start another session. 

A CRASH IS DEFINITELY TOLERABLE but not FREEZING because many users curse and complaint about them having to completely restart their phone again.

<h4>Actual Result</h4>
Window freezes! Every bits of UI components and apps turns black. Device button remain unuseable. But the music still remain playing on the background.

We suspect this to be a case of trying to open up a window when the device is doing some intensive work like GC related work etc. 

<h4>Expected Result</h4>
Window should open up normally or if the JS thread is too busy to handle the request due to garbage collection, or due to some other task, it should just CRASH and not freeze up everything.
