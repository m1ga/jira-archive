					"body": "I would like to see this issue reopened. I am experiencing this error on Windows 8.1 and Mac OSX Mavericks and Yosemite using titanium 3.4.1.GA.\r\n\r\nThe author of the previous comment (Harish Mridha) stated that he successfully created a demo module and provided a screenshot of the created module. However, the error the original submitter encountered did not occur during creation of the module. The error occurs when the user runs using either “ant run” or (in our case) “ant install” after creating the module.\r\n\r\nOur goal with titanium was to create a custom module for our application. Titanium Studio provides a mechanism to deploy your module to another Titanium app to facilitate debugging/testing. I found documentation online where you can run your module using the app.js file located in the example directory. This seemed to be a simpler method for testing our native module. Here was my process for replicating the error.\r\n\r\n*Create the module:*\r\n{code}\r\ntitanium create -p android -t module -n myexample --id com.mycompany.myexample -d . -u http://www.mycompany.com\r\n{code}\r\nThis command runs successfully with no errors\r\n\r\n*Compile the module (in the module’s android directory):*\r\n{code}\r\nant dist\r\n{code}\r\nThere are a few configuration changes I needed to make to the build.properties so that it contains the right sdk/ndk paths. Afterwards this command worked fine. I've saved my build.properties for reference to pastebin: http://pastebin.com/8TLx10m3\r\n\r\n*Install the module:*\r\n{code}\r\nant install\r\n{code}\r\nThis command fails and displays the output that the original submission describes. I have attached the output I receive when running the above command. I've saved the result of this command to pastebin: http://pastebin.com/ebPVmF88\r\n\r\n\r\nOther information:\r\n- If I create the module in Titanium Studio, the error still occurs when I run the “ant install” command.\r\n- I’ve noticed a user on stack overflow has posted a question about this very point. He notes that upgrading the MIN_API_LEVEL in the builder.py file will fix the issue. However, I find that to be a very hacky solution. The link for the question is: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26110492/titanium-mobile-cannot-build-android-modules-in-3-3-0\r\n- This occurs on all machines (Mac OSX Mavericks and Yosemite) in our office. I also tried it on a windows machine at home (Windows 8.1, Titanium 3.4.1.GA) and got the same error. \r\n\r\n\r\nThank you in advance,\r\nBryan Johnson",
