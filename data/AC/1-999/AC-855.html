<h3>Description</h3>

I've noticed an issue where an iOS app crashes when a NavBar button event called multiple times.

The iOS app causing this issue has a custom button built into the NavBar. The NavBar button opens a modal window from the current view. When pressing the button multiple times, the app crashes.

A workaround was by creating a hidden button object within the view where the crash was occurring. But this only works when building with Ti SDK 3.4.1.

   Hi,
   
   Please provide a test case to reproduce your problem. That will be really helpful to address your issue. Thanks.

   Hi ,
   I tested the issue you reported. It looks like the feature *"NavBar button event called multiple times on iOS apps"* in Appcelerator Studio is working fine for me. I tested this using the studio build: 4.1.1.201507141126 , iOS SDK: 8.1 and SDK 4.1.0 GA.
   I recommend you upgrade SDK to the latest build and let us know if you get the error again.
   I will mark this ticket as "resolved" since I can't reproduce it. However, feel free to reopen with additional information *(a test case)* if you notice otherwise.
   Thanks</li>
