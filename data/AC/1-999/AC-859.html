<h3>Description</h3>

Studio fails to launch the simulator with XCode 5.1 and iOS 7.1. Resolved by installing the previous version of XCode.

Error in Titanium. Fails running this command.

local:~/Titanium_Studio_Workspace/app$ "/Users/billy/Library/Application Support/Titanium/mobilesdk/osx/3.2.0.GA/iphone/ios-sim" launch "/Users/billy/Documents/Titanium_Studio_Workspace/app/build/iphone/build/Debug-iphonesimulator/App.app" --sdk 7.1 --family iphone --retina
dyld: Library not loaded: @rpath/iPhoneSimulatorRemoteClient.framework/Versions/A/iPhoneSimulatorRemoteClient
  Referenced from: /Users/billy/Library/Application Support/Titanium/mobilesdk/osx/3.2.0.GA/iphone/ios-sim
  Reason: image not found
Trace/BPT trap: 5

Both of those paths in that command exist (one to ios-sim and other to my app)

   Xcode 5.1 introduced a new framework for launching the simulator and we have added support for new version in SDK 3.2.2 release. Please refer to this blog for more information:

   How do you actually get the 3.2.2 release? Check for updates says no updates found from 3.2.1. I tried downloading from the site and it's still 3.2.1</li>
<li>Ritu Agrawal 2014-03-14

   You can install from command line the the latest released SDK 
   
   titanium sdk install</li>

   There is still something weird happening here. I have issues on two different computers.
   
   The simulator still fails.
   
   Command line says: You're up-to-date. Version 3.2.2.GA is currently the newest version available.
   
   However TitaniumStudio says: Titanium Studio, build: 3.2.1.201402041146</li>

   Please note that only the SDK version was upgraded to 3.2.2 and there is no change to Studio and CLI. You should be able to use 3.2.1 Studio with 3.2.2 SDK (specify it in tiapp.xml file) with new Xcode. Let us know if you run into any issue and we would be happy to reopen this ticket.</li>
<li>billy 2014-03-17

   That did it! I had no idea it was specified in the tiapp.xml. I assumed it would just use the most recent SDK.
   
   Thanks for debugging this</li>
