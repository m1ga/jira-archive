<h3>Description</h3>

I installed Titanium 3.4.1 and everything was good, android sdk was too installed without any problem....Then I noticed that in new->Titanium project, there is no alloy project ... 
I found that alloy was installed at location : C:\Users\smano\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules\alloy
I reinstalled it...
but still problem was same...
Also alloy command is not found in terminal but npm command exists.
......
Alloy templated should be present in new -> Titanium project But no alloy templates were found from the first time I started titanium

   Hi,
   
   Please run "sudo npm install -g alloy" in terminal, then check the destination folder, make sure user has access permission.
   If the problem still there, please run "ti info" and "ti setup check", and provide the output for both of them.

   Hi ,
   I tested the issue you reported. Alloy templates is present (new -> Titanium project)  in my Appcelerator Studio .
   I tested this using the studio build: 4.1.1.201507141126.
   If the problem still there, please run "appc ti info" and "appc ti setup check", and provide the output for both of them.
   I will mark this ticket as "resolved" since I can't reproduce it. 
   Thanks</li>
