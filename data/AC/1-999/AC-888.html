<h3>Description</h3>

Syncing multiple scrollviews with the “scroll” event.  There are two or three scrollviews side-by-side and when scrolling any one of the scrollview the other scrollviews scroll to match the one being scrolled.  The scrollviews should scroll together. 

When there are two scrollviews, it seems to scroll together lining up most of the time although it is slow.  When there are three scrollviews, it tries and tries to scroll attempting to line up together and never does.

The “scroll” event is not syncing multiple scrollviews based on the scroll of one of the scrollviews.
