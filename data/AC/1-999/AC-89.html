<h3>Description</h3>

Cannot login to the Apcelerator Platform through Appcelerator Studio or CLI.
In both cases an error is returned from the API:
Studio:
(Build 4.0.1.1428673626) [ERROR]  ERROR  | [ERROR] Invalid Appcelerator 360 Login Credentials. Check your username and password and try again.
CLI:
ERROR  | [ERROR] Invalid Appcelerator 360 Login Credentials. Check your username and password and try again.

It's possible to login to the dashboard using the same credentials. I use wrong credentials the error is different:
Invalid Appcelerator ID and password combination.

I have Titanium Studio installed.
Steps taken:
1- deleted .appcelerator directory in $HOME
2- Updated Java to 1.8 including dev tools
3- Manually installed CLI npm install -g appcelerator
4- appc use latest
5- appc setup

I logged out just in case and reattempted to login, but the issue persists.
doing appc login -l trace shows an output which looks ok, except for the following, right before the login exception:

loading org list...
setting org: undefined

I've also did the setup from a clean newly created computer profile (on the same Macbook), but same results.

   Hi:
   I'm still unable to login.
   I hope you can find the time to figure out what's going on.
   Thanks in advance!</li>

   Hi [~rlustemberg],
   
   This issue was caused by special characters in the password that you passed in during login. And, this was fixed in the latest Appc CLI builds: Appc CLI Registry (0.2.282) and Appc CLI NPM (0.3.55). 
   
   Can you download the latest Appc CLI and try again?
   
   Thanks,
   Wilson

   Hello,
   
   Tested this issue. This is not a bug  in  latest Appcelerator version. Not sure if this is still an issue for you. It doesn't appear to be based on our latest tests.Please follow the steps below and let us know. Now Titanium Studio has been retired in favor of  [Appcelerator Studio ](<a href="https://web.appcelerator.com/product/studio)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://web.appcelerator.com/product/studio)</a>, part of Appcelerator platform. So you have to install Appcelerator studio.
   
   Please follow the steps below and let us know.
   
   1.Check if Java JDK is installed: *java --version* (if not installed you can download it from [here ](<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html)</a> )
    2. Ensure that you have Node. JS installed:  *node --version*(if not installed, then you can download it from [here| <a href="https://web.appcelerator.com/product/cli" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://web.appcelerator.com/product/cli</a>])
   3. Install the Appcelerator CLI:  *npm install appcelerator -g*
   4. appc setup
   Login to  Appcelerator Studio from terminal using below command and then open your Studio:
   *appc login*
   *If the problem still persist then:*
   *Uninstall SDK:*
   appc ti sdk uninstall (SDK version)
   *Install SDK:*
   appc ti sdk install latest or
   appc use latest
   
   
   5.You can get more logging by using the *appc login -l* trace option.
