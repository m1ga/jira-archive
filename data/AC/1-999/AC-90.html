<h3>Description</h3>

I've been using LiveView and it's really good (and faster than TiShadow :) )

When any JS file is changed, the file is updated on my simulator pretty quickly, however when I add an image to the project, liveView doesn't do anything. If i then update a JS file, LiveView updates the simulator but the image doesn't exist.

Is there a way I can make LiveView update the app with images I add into my iphone folder?

The only way I know around this, is to rebuild the app (which kinda breaks the liveView benefit)

   The reason for this is that the app package has already been created and distributed to the simulator / device. Images added after the initial build, were not part of the app resources at the time and therefore will not show up. Rebuilding the app will address this, albeit not the optimal solution.
   
   I'd like to see us address this as well in a future release, however I am marking this as an improvement and not a bug.</li>

   Hello, I have tested this in Appcelerator Studio, build: 4.1.1.201507141126. Still this feature is not included. Thanks.</li>
