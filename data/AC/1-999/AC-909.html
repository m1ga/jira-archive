<h3>Description</h3>

I have ran into many bugs that crash my app when attempting to run my app on my Samsung device (Android 4.4.2).
2 main issues are using the Ti.Contacts.showContacts and Titanium.Media.openPhotoGallery functions.
The function will run and allow me to select the photo/contact but will then force the app to restart when trying to return back to the app.
The function will succeed in the console and the code works flawlessly on my other Android device (Android 4.4.4).
I think the issue could be linked as it appears to happen whenever a native function is ran and crashes at the same point when returning to the app.
Im not sure if this is an Android or Samsung specific bug but the issue does not happen on my Motorola Moto G (Android 4.4.4).

   Hello [~adamkearsley]!
   
   Please create two tickets, one for each one of the issues. We need a small test case for each issue (from your mail, it's likely that you will be able to get the testcase out of the KitchenSink source code). In addition to the test cases based in Ti Classic code, you need to add a crashlog of each one of the issues. 
   
   Best Regards</li>
</ol>
