   The attached screenshot error indicates that the project already exist in the titanium workspace folder. Can you please check in the titanium workspace folder that the file exist or not?
   
   Just curious if its happening with all the projects you are creating or the "example" one?</li>

   Happens with all projects, even with an empty workspace folder.</li>

   Thanks for the confirmation. I am trying to determine if it is Studio or CLI issue. Please open a Terminal and go to your workspace folder and execute the following command and let me know if it creates the project correctly.
   
   ti create --name example --id com.titanium.exmaple --workspace-dir .

   Resolving this ticket as I cannot reproduce this issue and the reporter has not provided requested information.</li>

   OK I wasn't able to get to this since I was finishing up another project sorry about that. I've tried the command line and I get this error:
   
   [ERROR] Failed to initialize "undefined" creator.</li>

   I also have this problem, just updated to 3.3.0. When choosing another SDK version when creating a project all seems to work fine.</li>
