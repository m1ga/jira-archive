   When you run your application, you can see the Studio Console log. Please copy and attach that output.</li>

   Thanks for attaching the requested information. Looking at your console output, it looks like a permissions issue in your home directory. Try running this command and see it it resolves your issue
   
   sudo chown <code>whoami</code> ~/tmp</li>

   Please try cleaning and rebuilding the project and see if it solves this problem. This issue may also be related to external storage and you may circumvent this issue by adding following line:
   
   android:installLocation="auto"

    I'm getting the following error when ever I tried to run my app in Android Emulator.
    
    [ERROR] : Failed to install apk on "emulator-5554"
    [ERROR] : Error: INSTALL_FAILED_CONTAINER_ERROR
    
    OS - OS X Yosemite
    All the SDKs are installed properly and it shows me the "Green" icon for Android SDK and iOS SDK. Same app iOS version is running without any issue.
    
    Any idea why it happens like this?</li>
