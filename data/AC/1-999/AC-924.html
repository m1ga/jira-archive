<h3>Description</h3>

There is a delayed response in rendering the screen properly with sub navigation windows by 1 seconds.

So if I create a navigation window, and then open the child navigation window, it takes 1 second for the screen to completely render. I will see the old layout, then the new one shortly after wards.

I open them like this:

	var controller = Alloy.createController('filters', {
		title : 'Filter',
		name : '_filters',
		flagWin : true,
		isFlyout : false
	});
	var newWindow = controller.getView();
	Alloy.Globals.navGroup.openWindow(newWindow, {
		animated : true
	});

Window then opens, and it is glitchy. The user sees the old layout for 1 second, then it changes to the new layout.

In the simulator, the window opens smoothly with the view content in the position. I see it on my iPhone 4, so to replicate the bug you need to test it on a device.

Here is my XML:

<Alloy>
    <Window id="win" backgroundColor='#fafafa'>
        <!--
        <RightNavButton>
        <Button id="lbtn" title='Log out' onClick="rightButtonClicked" />
        </RightNavButton>
        -->
        <LeftNavButton>
            <ImageView id="btnImgRight" onClick="rightButtonClicked"/>
        </LeftNavButton>
        <ScrollView id="scrollGeneric" visible='false'>
            <View id="formView" width='Ti.Platform.displayCaps.platformWidth' >
                <ImageView id="iconMenu" left='100' top='20' width = '136' height = '136' borderRadius='68'/>
                <!-- <Label id="lblNick" >Nickname</Label>-->
                <Label id="lblLater" >Name</Label>
                <TextField id="txtName" class="pickTypes" borderColor='#F0F0F0' paddingLeft='15' left='10' top='10' width = '300' editable=false />
                <Label id="lblLater" >Nickname</Label>
                <Label id="lblNumcharN" >8 characters max</Label>
                <TextField id="txtNick" paddingLeft='15' top='10' maxLength='8' width = '300' />
                <Label id="lblLater" >Description (optional)</Label>
                <Label id="lblNumchar" >250 characters max</Label>
                <View width='300' height="100" borderStyle="Ti.UI.INPUT_BORDERSTYLE_ROUNDED" borderColor= '#E3E3E3' backgroundColor= 'white'>
                 <TextArea id="txtAbout" maxLength='250' left='15' top='5' width = '290' />

                </View> 
                <View id='saveBut' height='Ti.UI.SIZE'>
                    <Button id="btnGo" bottom='20' onClick="goClicked" />
                </View>
            </View>
        </ScrollView>
        <View id = "view_indicator">
            <ActivityIndicator id="ind" />
        </View>
    </Window>
</Alloy>

Update:

$.win.addEventListener('open', function(e) {
	
	//show content when window has opened.
	$.winContent.visible = true;
});

This works, BUT it feels like a bit of a hack, given that I didn't have to wait for the window to open before showing the content properly.

   David, I am glad to see that I am not the only one that is experiencing this. I am not sure how to fix it, and it is really annoying given that my app is slightly glitchy now.
   
   For example, the back buttons glitch up when you go to the next window - you see the old default nav group button glitch up for a second, than my new one which messes up the user experience.
   
   The way I resolved that was to use a 3rd party module to delete the old back button, and than replace it with news ones. It looks better, but again you will see the rendering flicker a bit and it is a bit of a hack!</li>
<li>David Benko 2014-10-27

   Yes, I have no solution also. It's sad that such undesired bug had no comments from appcelerator's team so far</li>
<li>Samie Syed 2014-10-27

   David, I suspect that is because they are not aware of it.
   
   I often find that a lot of these bugs appear on an actual device. I suspect that the guys at appcelerator do not properly test titanium on every hand held device, leaving us developers to be the guinea pigs.
   
   I am glad you replied, because it gives credibility to the problem.</li>

   [~davidbenko], [~maveick2k]: 
   
   Guys, can you please provide info about:
   
   - In which device do you see this issues? 
   - Do you have different testcases to the one here? Would be really nice if we have more info on this. If you have any sample code in Ti Classic, would be awesome. 
   - Does this happen with simple windows on slow devices? Or you need to have a super complex window in order to be able to reproduce this?
   
   Thanks in advance! </li>

   Mauro,
   I have the same bug, but with simple (not navigation) window ( in fact, inside I have 3 children views )
   The bug occurs on iOS (3.4.1GA), at simulator and device (5,6,6plus) however at (4S,5S) it works.
