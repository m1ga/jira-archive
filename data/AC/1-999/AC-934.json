		"description": "I believe this to be a bug but maybe it is an intended feature.  If you create a geolocation event listener for 'location' and then remove it more than once you cannot add it back with a single addEventListener call.  Example: I had a play, pause, and stop button.  Play added the event listener while pause and stop removed it.  This cause an issue when the sequence was play, pause, stop (add, remove, remove).   I solved the problem by removing the superfluous remove associated with stop.  However, I would think that your code would not want to remove an event listener that was not registered or that it would gracefully ignore such a call.  I don't think it is - again, perhaps that is by design but just in case it is not I am logging this ticket.",
