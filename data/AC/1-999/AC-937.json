I have updated to the latest Titanium version 3.4.1.\r\n\r\nI have the correct distribution certificates in places both in my Xcode accounts preference and keychain also i have downloaded the correct distribution provisioning profile which i am using in Titanium studio.\r\n\r\nThe issue that i am getting is even after installing the correct profiles, on building the app from Xcode for submission i get the Invalid developer name and pp--uuid error message.\r\n\r\nI have read every developer form on titanium and nothing seems to resolve this, i even uninstalled Titanium and installed everything from scratch but still i get the same issue. \r\n\r\nI have even used the titanium CLI to check if i am using the correct distribution name, in CLI too it shows the correct distribution profile name.\r\n\r\nHowever if i build a small project on Xcode and use the same distribution profile there are no errors.\r\n\r\nSteps to produce this issues is given below\r\n\r\n1. Create a project in Titanium SDK version 3.4.1.\r\n2. Add some label or buttons etc\r\n3. Open Xcode and add your developer account to it.\r\n4. Download the developer and distribution profiles from your account.\r\n5. Use one of the distribution profile in Titanium project in the Ti.XML and info.plist, manifest files\r\n6. Build the project on simulator to see if its working\r\n7. Right click on the project in titanium studio -> go to build folder-> iPhone-> Click on the Xcode.proj file -> The project gets open in Xcode\r\n8. Select the appropriate team in the general section and change the code signing from build settings accordingly.\r\n9. Select the iOS device just above the iOS simulator section in Xcode.\r\n10. Try building the project, here you will face the issue which i am facing.\r\n\r\nIn case if not produced at your end please provide a guidance on what are the exact steps which you have followed.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I can't reproduce it.\r\nTo deploy an app to an iOS device you have to complete quite a few steps: \r\n{code}\r\n\r\n1.Register with Apple's Developer program\r\n2.Obtain a developer's certificate\r\n3.Register your test devices\r\n4.Create an App ID\r\n5.Create and install a development provisioning profile\r\n6.Build your app, embedding the profile within the app's bundle. This step takes care of installing to a locally-connected device as well. We will cover distributing your app to remote testers below as well.\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nI will mark this ticket as \"resolved\" since I can't reproduce it. However, feel free to reopen with additional information if you notice otherwise.I tested this using the studio build: 4.1.1.201507141126,TiSDK4.1.0GA and iOS SDK: 8.1\r\nThanks",
