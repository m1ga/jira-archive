<h3>Description</h3>

Problem : 

We were using google distance matrix api to calculate driving time between two locations , but result didn't match with the driving time on imaps on ipad.

we figured out : we need a IOS native module which will use MAPKIT library to 
calculate driving time between two locations on imap.

we are able to calculate time accurately on native ios . Module is working fine natively . On native ios code , we are using fireEvent to send output to Titanium App . we added event on module object in Titanium App,

But issue is : when module is firing event , Titanium App crashed with error : 
[DEBUG] Session did end with error (null)

Can you please help if we are missing something or guide us to find an alternative?
