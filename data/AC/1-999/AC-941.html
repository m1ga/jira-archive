<h3>Description</h3>

This is a fresh install of Ti Studio 3.2.3.201404181442 on my MB Pro with OSX 10.9.4. When starting TI Studio, a popup appears with the title "Titanium Updates" listing the required updates like Titanium SDK, CLI, NodeJS, Nocd.ACS and Alloy.
All boxes are checked, but clicking install does not do anything.
I cannot close the popup, install is the only available button.
I was able to get to Titanium preferences and manually installed the Titanium SDK. Also I manually installed NoseJS.
After restarting TI Studio, those 2 items dropped from the list but the issue remains. A cannot do anything with TI Studio.

This is the same issue as TC-3643 which was closed so I cloned it here.

I opened the console and when I click the Install button, nothing happend, but the console shows this line:
sudo: <user> : TTY-unknown ; PWD=/Applications/Titanium Studio/TitaniumStudio.app/Contents/MacOS ; USER=root ; COMMAND=/bin/echo SUCCESS

   Could you please attach the output of the following commands to diagnose the issue further.
   1. Ti info
   2. Ti sdk
   3. Ti config</li>
<li>Shuo Liang 2014-07-17

   also, if it is possible, would you please re-install the studio?</li>
<li>Bo 2014-07-17

   I added the output of the three commands.
   
   I already re-installed Ti Studio without success.
   
   Eventually I got it to run, but the issue is not resolved.
   I manually installed all the stuff that it needed with the nmp install command from command line.
   
   When I now start Ti Studio, it checks for updates but doesn't find any so doesn't show me the popup. But when I uninstall something or it finds an update it will come back and haunt me.</li>

   Hello,
   from your Ti info.txt, you don't have anything in the android add-ons. Any possibility that you download any google api android emulator? 
   
   Follow this docs for more information:

   Hi,
   Isn't it a problem about sudo?
   Because when completely same problem happened by me, I resolved with changing sudo setting.
   Before, I had set my default login user to be able to do sudo with no password entering. like this with visudo,
   
   User ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
   
   And that was why Titanium Studio didn't work even though I clicked install button on updating popup. 
   I changed this like this,
   
   User ALL=(ALL) ALL
   
   This setting force the user to enter own password when the user does sudo.
   With this setting, Titanium Studio works. I clicked the install button on updating popup, and Titanium Studio progressed.
   
   You'd better check your setting once, just enter following command on terminal.
   
   sudo visudo
   
   I'm sorry about my poor english.
   Regards</li>

   Hi Yuhsak,
   
   That is exactly the issue. I also setup sudo with the nopasswd parameter.
   Thanks a lot for solving this issue!!
   
   Bit surprising though that making sudo more accessible will stop the installed.
   Isn't that a bug?
   
   Thanks a lot!
