<h3>Description</h3>

I am trying to deploy to my iOS device for development but Titanium cannot find the iOS certificate.

It seems apple has changed the name of its certificates:

<a href="http://developer.appcelerator.com/question/178922/unable-to-find-any-valid-ios-developer-certificates" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://developer.appcelerator.com/question/178922/unable-to-find-any-valid-ios-developer-certificates</a>

My certificates are installed but Titanium is not finding them because it's looking for something starting with "iPhone"; now the certificates start with "iOS".

Titanium details:

Titanium Studio, build: 3.4.1.201410281727

   [~rtlechuga], Can you please confirm this with mobile engineer teamï¼Œhard to contact them during my time zone. Thanks</li>

   I updated XCode, ran the certificate signing request process again and now it's working. You can probably close this.</li>
