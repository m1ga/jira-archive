<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Steps to Reproduce</h4>

Trying to use the SQLite Database Encryption Module and the Appcelerator Crypto Module, both available for download from the Appcelerator Platform Dashboard. After adding those modules to a sample app, I tried to bring up the app on the Android and iOS simulators. However, in doing so, got an error message saying that they were unlicensed modules.

Attached are the screenshots of the simulators, and the tiapp.xml file. Please note that there was no error in running the app with only the 'apm' or 'touchtest' modules, but I got the error only after adding the Database Encryption and Crypto modules.

Can you please help me so I can use those two modules? 

Thank you so much for your help!
Vui

<h4>Actual Result</h4>
The app came up in the simulators, but there were licensing issues.

<h4>Expected Result</h4>
For the app to come up in the simulators, with the SQLite Database Encryption and Crypto Modules loaded into the project, without any problems.

   Hi,
   
   Please login to <a href="https://marketplace.appcelerator.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://marketplace.appcelerator.com</a>, make sure you are using enterprise account and Appcelerator studio.
   Then go to account -> assign products to check whether there is a sit of the target module for your account.
   
   Regard,
   Shuo</li>

   Hi Shuo,
   
   I went into account -> assign products in my marketplace account, and did not see the SQLite Database Encryption or Appcelerator Crypto modules listed there.
   
   Just to check, I ran my sample app again with the modules and still getting the "unlicensed module(s) detected" error. If you can help me, that would be greatly appreciated!
   
   Thank you so much,
   Vui </li>

   Hello [~vui_engineer@yahoo.com]:
   
   If you are using the dashboard, you should be adding this issue to the Salesforce website. Please send me a mail to mpmiranda@appcelerator.com and I can send you all the links. 
   
   Best Regards,
