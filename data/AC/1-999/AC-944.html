<h3>Description</h3>

I am using the push notification code similar to the one's provided in the documentation.  I have attached the code block and an image showing the error.

To recreate on device:
-Start application and register/login to Titanium Cloud.
-Go to background and start another application
-Send a push notification to the device.
-Select notification to relaunch the Titanium App
-App crashes with error.

   I used the provided function/test code and was not able to reproduce the issue.
   Tested on 3.2.1.GA
   Galaxy SII, Nexus 5
   Steps my sample project does:
   
   1. Call provided AndroidNotificationRegistration();
      a. Retrieves Device Token, on success login to ACS cloud with Cloud.login();
      b. On login success I subscribe to a channel with Cloud.pushNotifications.subscribe()
   2. Leave App and Open browser/Other app. 
   3. Use WebConsole to send push notification.
   4. Click on notification on device, returns to test app without problem.
   
   Things to note and some assumptions I made:
   1. I assume you are taking care of logging in and subscribing somewhere else in your unprovided code. 
   2. I had to remove references to 'pushDialog' in your provided code. It looked like you were trying to access it before creating it.
   
   Hopefully this sheds some light on your scenario.
   
   Thanks,
   Seth

   Thanks Seth for taking the time to update this ticket.  
   
   I should've mentioned that the Galaxy S2 was on 2.3.6. The CloudPush version was 2.2.  
   
   I downloaded version 2.3.3 of CloudPush and it fixed the issue.  I'll do more tests before I mark this as resolved.</li>
