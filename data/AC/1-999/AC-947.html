<h3>Description</h3>

A base controller that is created without a view does not get copied to the build folder and thus gets an error when Alloy goes to apply properties to that object.


A workaround is to provide an simple view with an empty Alloy tag.

   [~brentonhouse] I just spotted this old ticket. Have you tried with a recent Alloy version? We did make some changes in 1.5.1 that might relate. If you could, would you attach a sample project to make it easier to test? If it's still valid, I'll move to the Alloy project so that we can take a look at it.</li>

   I will take a look at it.  Thanks!</li>
