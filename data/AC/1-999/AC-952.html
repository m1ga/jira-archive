   I just tried Packaging an app for AdHoc using Appcelerator Studio and SDK 4.0.0.GA and it seemed to work ok. 
   
   Since this was the first time, it did show the popup about privacy settings, then XCode opened.  I had to manually open the Organizer window though.

   [~ceyhun@restoriatasarim.com] try this:
   - Sign out from Studio (click on your name at the right bottom corner)
   - Sign out  from CLI: $ appc logout -D
   - Login back in studio
   - Try again</li>

   What happens if you try and package an .ipa file? 
   
   Are you still having this issue? I'm currently building/packing/archiving fine for AdHoc and Distribution on iOS. Also Android packaging is fine. 
   
   Here's my setup:
   
   Operating System
     Name                        = Mac OS X
     Version                     = 10.10.3
     Node.js Version             = 0.12.2
     npm Version                 = 2.7.4
     CLI Version                 = 4.0.1
   Titanium SDK
     SDK Version                 = 4.1.0.v20150601234429
   XCode : 6.3.2
