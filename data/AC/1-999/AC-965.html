<h3>Description</h3>

After installation of "Appcelerator Studio 4.1.0" archive, with forced upgrade to "Appcelerator Studio 4.1.2", I am forced to order a free "Appcelerator Device Authorization" by E-Mail.

Authorization Code: *9660*
Authorization Code: *3694*
Authorization Code: *5280*

Both the first two codes were rejected, and you can be shure that I can enter 4 digits correctly.

Further tip for improvement: Tell the users that they must not enter the leading and following star "*" character.

But i did not fail due to the star character, I failed due to the right 4 digit authorization code. The third one .. worked :-).

You can be shure, I felt helpless with such given wrong activation codes... just to start a free IDE :-(.

Sincerely
Rolf

   Hello [~hemmerling],
   
   Is it still an issue for you, please let us know.

   I canÂ´t tell you, as my machine is now registered.
   As I said, I succeeded by the 3rd try.
   
   I will tell if I re-install the software on a different machine, if there should be the same problem.
   
   Besides that the Appcelerator team should think about why I got 2 invalid codes ( maybe something is wrong with the code generator?? ).
   
   Sincerely
   Rolf</li>
