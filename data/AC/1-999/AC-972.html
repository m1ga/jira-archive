   Please attach the output of the following command to diagnose the issue further.
   
   1. Titanium info
   2. Titanium config
   3. Titanium sdk
   </li>
<li>Erik Barmun 2014-03-28

   Attached the required information.
   I've seen another issue, When I run the command as Admin it works, but if i run the command as sigle user (mine) it throw an error.</li>
<li>Erik Barmun 2014-03-29

   There're some answer to fix this problem?</li>
<li>Ritu Agrawal 2014-03-31

   Eric - Did you mean to say that Android SDK is detected when you run Studio / CLI as an administrator? It appears that you don't have node package available when you run it as a normal user.</li>
<li>Erik Barmun 2014-03-31

   No realy Ritu, I could fix that issue reinstalling Titaniuma, Java and AndroidnSDk as Administrator (that's rare because my user is admin).
   But i still have the problem with the SDK detection; i've attach 2 screenshot about sdk Mannager and Titaium  Studio
   if you need some extra information please let me know</li>
<li>Ritu Agrawal 2014-03-31

   This seems to be the duplicate of TISTUD-6007. Can you please try the workaround provided in the comment and see if it helps resolve the issue?</li>
<li>Erik Barmun 2014-03-31

   Hi, again.
   I tried that solucion but it doesn't fix my problem TISTUD-6007,
   I atach something interesting, i've installed the Nodejs, but i cant's see the npm version; i've compared this with other persons and they can see that information</li>
<li>Ritu Agrawal 2014-03-31

   Eric - Can you please try reinstalling the node package and then start the titanium studio?</li>
<li>Erik Barmun 2014-03-31

   I did it, but the situation persist, i can't see npm version and Titanium Studio can't still detect Android SDK versions
   Do you know what could be a solution?</li>
<li>Ritu Agrawal 2014-04-01

    Can you please check the permission's once again? Also, can you please go through "installing node" guide again and see if you have installed node correctly.

<li>Erik Barmun 2014-04-01

    Hello, i've done it 3 times today and i think it's correctly installed because when i uninstall it and run "ti info" in CMD it throw an error.
    But after all still i've the same problem with Android SDK detection.
    There're some way to see details of the error when i choose the Android SDK directory path?</li>

<li>Erik Barmun 2014-04-02

    Another related situation to this issue is than Titanum can't Install "Node.ACS", but when I check with the npm command it show the version of "ACS" (screen shot attached).
    Could you tell us what can we do?
    Any answers?</li>

    [~ebarriga] From the diagnotic logs and ti info output, I guess the problem is with the installation of Android SDK located at "C:\Android_sdk_C". Since there are no Android SDKs installed in that location, Studio and CLI are not able to detect it as a valid Android SDK root location. Can you run the platform configuration wizard through TiApp editor (select the Android platform and save it - this should prompt for installing the unconfigured platforms). If you expand the settings of Android platform and set the path to "C:\Android_sdk_C" and select an Android SDK entity to 4.X or any version greater than 2.3.3, I believe Studio should be able to install all required versions and set the path in preference.
    
    Alternatively, if that doesn't work for any reason, please try to install Android SDKs from Android SDK Manager and verify whether 'ti info -t android' recognize valid platforms and then, Studio should recognize as a valid SDK location.</li>
<li>Erik Barmun 2014-04-04

    I tried today with both and the problem persist, i hope you can help me, i'm a little tired because the problem has more than a week and i don´t know what to do</li>
<li>Praveen Innamuri 2014-04-04

    The Android SDK v4.4.2 is installed into C:\android-sdk-win, but why is the preferences is referencing to C:\android-sdk-win\sdk ? That is the reason Studio is not able to validate the Android SDK location. In order to fix this, you might need to run through the below steps :
    
    1) Set the Studio preference for Android SDK is set to "C:\android-sdk-win"
    2) Make sure even the titanium CLI also reference to the same location using 'ti config' command (the android.sdkPath value). Otherwise, run on terminal : titanium config android.sdkPath "C:\android-sdk-win"
    3) Run on terminal "ti info -t android" : It should recognize the platform versions installed for Android in that location.
    </li>
<li>Erik Barmun 2014-04-04

    It was with the second Try (when i installed with SDK Mannager), I mean:
    1. I tried with Titanium to install the Android SDK and it doesn't work (the SDK's where downloaded in default folder "Android-sdk-win" with the correct subfolders).
    2. When the previous step didn't work, I tried with SDK Mannager this app use a main folder and it use SDK in a subfolder("Android-sdk-win/sdk"). 
    
    But i'll try what you suggest, i hope this help me. I'll tell you the results.</li>
<li>Erik Barmun 2014-04-05

    I did what you suggested, and it still doesn't work, now i guess it isn't a Android SDK problem, i mean, could be posible than Nodejs, Java or another dependence could be causing it?
    i will wait for your help and answer
    best regards</li>
<li>Erik Barmun 2014-04-08

    help please!!!!!!!</li>
<li>Praveen Innamuri 2014-04-08

    Well, that's strange. If the Titanium CLI recognizes a location as valid Android SDK root, then Studio would also recognize it as a valid location. Can you confirm whether the Android SDK location configured in CLI is same as in the Android preference page. Provide the information/docs at
    1) 'ti info -t android' output
    2) Studio preference showing that the Android location is same as the valid location in the ti info output.
    
    I'm not sure whether if you are seeing the problem described at TIMOB-16188.</li>
<li>Erik Barmun 2014-04-08

    Hi thanks for your answer.
    I'll atach new files with information about Ti.cmd and some screenshots in one picture, i've tried again installing with "SDK Manager" but i still have the problema.
    i saw the issue you suggest me (16188) but it didn't have a solucion and i'm not able to run a mobile project, because it doesn't show ADVs (thats is because it doesn't have SDK detected).
    I hope you can helpe with this new information, i don't know if a remote support is valid in this situation.
    best regards</li>
<li>Praveen Innamuri 2014-04-08

    [~cbarber] Any thoughts ?
    
    Erik has Android SDK installed without any issues, but the ti info does not recognize the installed platforms and thus, Studio. He has Language set to es_MX.</li>
<li>Chris Barber 2014-04-08

    Hi [~ebarriga], there are a couple issues:
    
    1. You need to specify the correct "android.sdkPath" config option. You can do this by running "ti setup android" and entering the path to the Android SDK. You can verify this setting by running "ti config android.sdkPath" and "ti info -t android"
    
    2. You have Android SDK Tools 22.6.2 installed which are NOT supported by Titanium SDK 3.2.2.GA or older. We have fixed the bug and it'll be available in 3.2.3.GA. You'll have to downgrade to Android SDK Tools to 22.6 or older or wait until Titanium 3.2.3.GA ships.</li>

    [~ebarriga] Download <a href="http://dl-ssl.google.com/android/repository/tools_r22.6-windows.zip" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://dl-ssl.google.com/android/repository/tools_r22.6-windows.zip</a>, then rename the "tools" directory in your Android SDK directory, then unzip the file you downloaded into the Android SDK dir. Now, try running "ti info -t android" and see if that solves the problem. If not, you may need to use an older Android SDK Tools version.</li>
<li>Erik Barmun 2014-04-10

    Chris Barber, I did what you said but I still have the same problem, Titanium doesn't show Android SDK,  I've tried several things but anything can fix it, what could I do?

      SDK Path                    = C:\android-sdk-win

<li>Chris Barber 2014-04-11

    [~ebarriga] As I suggested above, if that doesn't work, then use an even older version of the SDK tools such as <a href="http://dl-ssl.google.com/android/repository/tools_r22-windows.zip" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://dl-ssl.google.com/android/repository/tools_r22-windows.zip</a>, <a href="http://dl-ssl.google.com/android/repository/tools_r21-windows.zip" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://dl-ssl.google.com/android/repository/tools_r21-windows.zip</a>, or <a href="http://dl-ssl.google.com/android/repository/tools_r20-windows.zip" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://dl-ssl.google.com/android/repository/tools_r20-windows.zip</a>, etc.</li>

    Resolving this ticket as we cannot reproduce this issue. Please let us know if you are still running into this issue and we would be happy to reopen it.</li>
<li>Erik Barmun 2014-05-01

    Only as background, the only solution was to format and install from scratch.
    Thanks for the Track</li>
