<h3>Description</h3>

we are using an ACS service serach.json to get the registered user list, it was returning following json object:
{"meta":{"code":200,"status":"ok","method_name":"searchUsers","page":1,"per_page":500,"total_pages":1,"total_results":500},,"response":{"users":..........}

few days ago we are getting proper count of total_pages in meta information tag, but now its returning "1" (always).

Please check this service and its meta information part and provide correction.

we are hitting the service through dot net code using below steps:
1.   Login to ACS using  users/login.json service
2.   After successfull login we hit search service

   1.   I hit the service login.json with admin user account. 
   
   we have more than 22000 registered user on ACS.
   
   2.   Old result was like this:
   
   {"code":200,"status":"ok","method_name":"searchUsers","page":1,"per_page":500,"total_pages":44,"total_results":500} ,,"response": {"users":..........}
   
   difference in result is:
   
   Previously we are getting total_pages is around 44, but now we are getting always 1</li>
