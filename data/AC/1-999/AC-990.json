Also, follow the instruction [here|https://platform.appcelerator.com/#/product/cli] to install CLI, SDK.\r\n\r\nNow for running project in Android, Appcelerator has support for Genymotion virtual devices (or emulators). It is an alternative to the Android SDK's native Android Virtual Device manager (emulator). Genymotion emulators run a lot faster than the native Android emulators (even with Intel Hardware Accelerated Execution Manger enabled). Here is the link on how you can [install and configure|http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#!/guide/Installing_Genymotion] Genymotion with Appcelerator. Hope this helps, Thanks.",
