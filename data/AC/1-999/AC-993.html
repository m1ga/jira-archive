<h3>Description</h3>

I am able to build the code using titanium command. when we build the code using xocode5 by selecting profile and certificate from build settings then only below error comes.

[ERROR] : ?? ?Invalid "--developer-name" value "iPhone Distribution: XXXX" [ERROR] : ?? ?Invalid "--pp-uuid" value "FD4487D7-99D0-42F5-B9E2-471E17F964E4" For help, run: titanium help build Command /bin/sh failed with exit code *1*

NOTE: If i don't select any profile and certificate then above error will not come. In my case i have the change the profile and certificate.

steps to reproduce:

make sure that install the titanium using command line and steps given below

Make the /usr/local directory writable by all:
sudo chmod 777 /usr/local
Set npm to install to your home directory, or another directory of your choosing by setting the npm prefix. For example, you can add the following to your .bash_profile or other initialization file:
export NPM_CONFIG_PREFIX=$HOME
sudo npm install titanium -g
titanium login
titanium sdk install 3.3.0.GA
titanium sdk select 3.3.0.GA

Clean and build your project using below commands.

titanium clean --platform ios --project-dir /Users/xyz/abc --log-level info
titanium build --platform ios --build-only --project-dir /Users/xyz/abc

Xcode project will generate Automatically, open that xcode project, go to build setting update the Provisioning profile and code signing identity.
Select iOS device
Product-->Archive
It failed with above error.

   HI,
   
   Based on your error info. The problem seems come from Xcode, not Titanium. Either your updated certificate and profile has problem or Xcode can't handle this change. Can you please try to update certificate and profile in Titanium before build on command line. Also, If prossible, you could update Xcode to 6.1 see if there is still problem.
   
   Regards,

   Hi,
   This profile and certificate will work for other projects and i have tested.Even it will work for Xcode5.1 also.
   when we build the code using titanium command, Xcodeproj will generate automatically during the build process.
   Open generated Xcodeproject in Xcode5.1, Move to build settings, update the profile and code signing identity,
   select iOS, Product-->Archive then the above problem comes. Let me try with Titanium..
   
   My Observation: This problem comes when we open Generated Xcodeproj by titanium build command then try to update the profile and code signing identity.</li>

   Use Appcelerator studio as Titanium is obsolete. Follow the instruction [here](<a href="https://web.appcelerator.com/product/studio)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://web.appcelerator.com/product/studio)</a> to download the latest Appcelerator studio. Also, follow the instruction [here](<a href="https://web.appcelerator.com/product/cli)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://web.appcelerator.com/product/cli)</a> to install CLI, SDK. Hope this helps. Thanks.</li>
