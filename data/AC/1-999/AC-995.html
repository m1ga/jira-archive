   Hi,
   I have searched little bit, someone had bug like this(that is only one person from the internet), the reason is that my windows 7 has Turkish language. Changing my operating system language to ENGLISH solve this issue. If you can see developers from Turkey suffering from this issue, you can help them with suggesting ENGLISH operating system language.
   Thank you.</li>

   I am glad that it is working fine for you. Let us know if you run into any other issue.</li>
</ol>
