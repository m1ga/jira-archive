   Please follow this test case:
   
   1.Create a new classic project in Titanium. (In Titanium Studio 3.2.1, SDK 3.2.2. , CLI 3.2.1, IOS SDK 7.1 , Mavericks, Xcode 5.1)
   2. Paste the following code in app.js
   ~~~
   makeCall();
   
   function makeCall() {
   var currentReq = Titanium.Network.createHTTPClient();
   currentReq.setTimeout(300000);
   currentReq.onload = function() {
   };
   
   currentReq.onerror = function(e)
   { var status =this.status; var statusText = this.statusText; alert("Error on Request",+e.error); }
   
   ;
   currentReq.open("GET", "<a href="http://developer.appcelerator.com/assets/img/DEV_appteam_photo.png" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://developer.appcelerator.com/assets/img/DEV_appteam_photo.png</a>");
   currentReq.send();
   }
   ~~~
   3. Run the project in IOS 7.1 simulator.
   
   You will get the "status" 0, which indicates the "UNSENT" request.In the console, the given error will be displayed.
   
   The same problem is seen even if no request is sent. Just create a new project and try it in the given environment, and you will get the same error regarding connection to the Analytics. I have attached a screen shot of the error .

   I tried your test case and it runs just fine with 3.2.3 GA release. I added an alert to unload function and it gets called correctly. Your test is using HTTP and not HTTPS protocol so TLS or SSL should not be in play anyway.
   
   Note that your console error is unrelated to your test as it is a warning about sending app analytics to Appcelerator server that uses HTTPS.</li>

   Resolving this ticket as we cannot reproduce it and the reporter has not followed  up with more information.</li>
