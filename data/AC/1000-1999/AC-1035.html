   Hi ,
   
   The facts:
   <code><pre>
   
   1. Titanium and Alloy remain OSS and free (appcelerator.org)
   2. The new platform adds a lot of new products and services
   3. Development on the new platform is free up to the point where you need to publish your first app
   4. The cheapest tier is the indie seat for $39/seat/month
   5. Existing users (up till March 31) get a free indie seat for live
   6. If you wish to continue to use the OSS version you will have to build the SDK from source yourself
   
   </pre></code>
   
   *In Short*
   <code><pre>
   1. Existing users get a free for life $39/month Indie seat
   2. New users can try/develop for free, but yes; to publish he has to purchase the Indie seat
   </pre></code>
   
   You can keep running from vendor to vendor to not pay any money, but al of them in the end have to pay their bills. Maybe as developers we've become a bit spoiled with free software? As an entrepreneur you have to make investments. 
   
   Thanks</li>

   Hi Harish,
   
   Thanks for you response, but ...
   
   >>1. Existing users get a free for life $39/month Indie seat
   How I can get it? I don't see such option.
   
   >>2. New users can try/develop for free, but yes; to publish he has to purchase the Indie seat
   To publish to where? AppStore/GooglePlay?
   
   >>Maybe as developers we've become a bit spoiled with free software?
   I don't think so. Titanium was a buggy product with poor support and endless amount of issues. But it had advantages - it was free and open source. I don't like the idea to pay for such low-quality product. Btw, Xamarin is $25/mo for Indie. They want me to pay $39/mo for "titanium"? Are they kidding us?</li>

   Hi
   I saw the page. It tells nothing about how to get the free Indie subscription. Or I've missed something?
   
   Thanks</li>

   [~fixplease] Titanium users with accounts before march this year will have indie plan for life, let me know what is your Titanium account and we can activate you, you don't need to pay the indie seat if you have a titanium account already.

   Hi Radamantis,
   
   In fact I had several accounts. I created a new one each time I reinstalled Titanium. Now I don't even remember all of them.
   So I've just created and activated dev.appcelerator@gmail.com. Could you activate the Indie for this account, please?
   I hope there is no any doubt that I've been using Titanium for a long time, taking into account number of Jira items created by me? Seems, the very first item was created on 22/Mar/14 however in fact I started using Titanium even earlier.
   
   Thanks a lot.</li>

   [~fixplease] Hi, we activated your account, you are going to receive an email to the email address provided, just FYI , this is going to be your always free indie seat.

   Hi Radamantis,
   
   I've got no e-mail messages (yes, I've checked spam folder as well).
   However, the Indie is activated indeed as I can see in the my appcelerator profile.
   
   Thank you very much!
   
   PS. sorry for the delayed response. 
    
   
   Regards.</li>

   Hi,
    i am am a titanium user and i claimed my free seat when appcelarator announced that titanium studio will be stopped. But now, after a year of usage, i get a message that my organisation is expiring in 5 days. I thought it was meant to be free forever for users who had a titanium account before march. When i contacted support, i was told that "_there were two steps: first, you needed to have signed up for the Platform by June 30, 2015, and then to have claimed your Indie seat by Sept 30, 2015 from the Platform billing page_". I think it is misleading users to think that they get an indie seat "_for life_". My email account is mdhunnooa@gmail.com. Can you please clarify on this issue? </li>
