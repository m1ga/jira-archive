					"body": "Hi ,\r\n\r\nThe facts:\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n1. Titanium and Alloy remain OSS and free (appcelerator.org)\r\n2. The new platform adds a lot of new products and services\r\n3. Development on the new platform is free up to the point where you need to publish your first app\r\n4. The cheapest tier is the indie seat for $39/seat/month\r\n5. Existing users (up till March 31) get a free indie seat for live\r\n6. If you wish to continue to use the OSS version you will have to build the SDK from source yourself\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n*In Short*\r\n{code}\r\n1. Existing users get a free for life $39/month Indie seat\r\n2. New users can try/develop for free, but yes; to publish he has to purchase the Indie seat\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nYou can keep running from vendor to vendor to not pay any money, but al of them in the end have to pay their bills. Maybe as developers we've become a bit spoiled with free software? As an entrepreneur you have to make investments. \r\n\r\nThanks",

					"body": "Hi Harish,\r\n\r\nThanks for you response, but ...\r\n\r\n>>1. Existing users get a free for life $39/month Indie seat\r\nHow I can get it? I don't see such option.\r\n\r\n>>2. New users can try/develop for free, but yes; to publish he has to purchase the Indie seat\r\nTo publish to where? AppStore/GooglePlay?\r\n\r\n>>Maybe as developers we've become a bit spoiled with free software?\r\nI don't think so. Titanium was a buggy product with poor support and endless amount of issues. But it had advantages - it was free and open source. I don't like the idea to pay for such low-quality product. Btw, Xamarin is $25/mo for Indie. They want me to pay $39/mo for \"titanium\"? Are they kidding us?",

When i contacted support, i was told that \"_there were two steps: first, you needed to have signed up for the Platform by June 30, 2015, and then to have claimed your Indie seat by Sept 30, 2015 from the Platform billing page_\".
