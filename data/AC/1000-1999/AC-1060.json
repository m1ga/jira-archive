		"description": "For iOS:\r\nWhen populating rows (containing images) in a TableView, and updating the table, replacing the rows with new rows, this type of error intermittently happens:\r\n\r\n{{\r\n[INFO] :   failbags2(95744,0x57fd1a8) malloc: *** error for object 0x7a2ca800: pointer being freed was not allocated\r\n[INFO] :   *** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug\r\n}}\r\n\r\nThe error is intermittent, but happens about 30% of the time, which makes it a problem.\r\n\r\nI'd posted a question: \r\nhttps://developer.appcelerator.com/question/179135/images-in-tableview-crashing-app-with-null-pointer-failures\r\n\r\n... but after a day, haven't had any attempts at an answer. If I'm doing something grossly wrong - please let me know, but it looks like something is strange with garbage collection or other aspects of memory management. I could swear this problem wasn't here in previous iterations (but can't be absolutely sure). Compiling and running in xcode, when it breaks, seems to indicate that it's something to do with images, or the clearing up of them (TiUIImageView or something like that)\r\n\r\nThe attached \"index.js\" file is for app/controllers - replace the contents of index.js with the contents of this file. In the index.js file, is a snippet to replace the index.xml file in views.\r\n\r\nI've also uploaded a zip file of my test project to:\r\nhttp://scratch.otron9000.co.za/failbags2.zip\r\n\r\nJust in case you want to download that and use it.\r\n\r\nWhen running the test app, if console.log indicates an iteration as high as 4 or 5, the test won't fail. Uninstall the app from the simulator, clean the project in Titanium, and run from Titanium, and try again. Rinse, cycle, repeat :)",
