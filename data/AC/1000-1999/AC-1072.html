<h3>Description</h3>

***NOTE: updated as this is also the case when using multiple columns ... not just single columns as originally reported. ***

Note: I will not be providing code to replicate this because it is very easy and occurs on the device - not the emulator - and there is a workaround:

1. Create a picker (useSpinner:true)
2. create a column
3. create a data array
4. iterate through array and call ti.ui.createPickerRow method.
5. add resultant object to column and add column to picker.

Symptom: none for Android emulator - works fine.  On device: the single column throws off index of values by 1.  It creates an extra value.  When a row is selected from the getSelectedRow it will always return the row above it and you cannot select the top-most row (also there appears to be a blank row a the bottom).  This does not impact the picker in non-spinner mode.  Work-around: add data directly to picker and DO NOT use a column.  Note: This is also different from iOS in which it will work fine.  It seems to be an Android only device level issue that does not impact the emulator.

   We need a simple runnable test case to reproduce this issue. I understand that you do not wish to provide a test case but we would have to close this ticket in absence of a test case.</li>
