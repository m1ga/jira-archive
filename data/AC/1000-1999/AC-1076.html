     It would be great if you could provide me with a quick response.</li>

   The enablement of Soasta service fails for couple of reasons :
   
   - When the Test module available on the machine is out-of-date and Studio unable to install the latest module.
   - If the password required for enabling the app using Test service is not in sync with the Appcelerator login credentials.
   
   In order to investigate this issue, can you enable the Debug Level to All in Preferences > Studio > Troubleshooting, and then try to enable the Test service for your project. Send us the workspace logs for further investigation (Help > Studio > View log file).</li>

   Please find the attached log file.</li>

   The log contains very high level details of the exception, so looks the logging debug level is not enabled to All (as I suggested in my previous comment).
   
   Though I did see the connection related issues while it attempts to connect to Test service, we would get to figure out more details if detailed logs are available.</li>

   Hi Nilanka,
   
   It looks like the credentials for your SOASTA record got corrupted. We forced a regeneration of your records and things now look as they should.
   Could you please try accessing the test tab for one of your projects and then try to enable services again?
   
   Thank you!</li>
