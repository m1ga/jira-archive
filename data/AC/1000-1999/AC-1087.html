   Anybody there?
   
   "ti build" command is permanently waiting for something if 3.3.0.GA is selected.
   
   Could you pay some attention to the issue please as the new version is completely useless until it can't build projects.</li>

   I believe this may be related to either TIMOB-17344 or TIMOB-17411. Can you please take a look and see if either of those make sense?</li>

   Hello [~fixplease]! 
   
   Some comments:
   
   1. Does the Ingo message help? Are you getting similar results to the bugs in TIMOB listed?
   2. Can you please provide the output of your ti info
   3. Can you please try to launch your new emulator within the AVD just to make sure it's a sane environment?
   4. When you do your test, do you get anything in the build.log?
   
   TIA!
