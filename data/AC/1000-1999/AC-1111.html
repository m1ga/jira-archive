<h3>Description</h3>

App keeps crashing on iPad (iPad only app) with the following crash log, and I have no idea how to debug this, or provide steps how to reproduce this. The live app has many views, and this log does not provide me with any information as to what happened in which file within my project :

I know its something to do with out of bounds call of an array, but where and how to catch this is nearly impossible, and the error is being thrown within an xcode file : 

File: EmbeddedAgent.m
Line: 262. 

I am attaching a screenshot of the log. 

Issue has been reported by various other users, but no resolution is yet provided. Please look into the defect and let me know possible causes and remedy to fix this, as this is happening sporadically within a live app.
