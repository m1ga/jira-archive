<h3>Description</h3>

The documentation for Ti.UI.View states that font sizes on iOS are specified in typographical units which are 1/72 of an inch.
This is not true. Specifying a font size of 72 (or '72', or '72pt') produces a font that is less than half of an inch in height. This does not seem to depend on retina/non-retina setting nor on the font family being used.
The units are more like 1/144th of an inch.

   Hello,
   looks like an issue with native iOS rather than Titanium Appcelerator. Please check this docs on the issue:
   
   <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/6107836" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://stackoverflow.com/a/6107836</a>
   
   and let me know if that info helps you to accomplish the one to one typography representation. 
   
   Best Regards!</li>

   I agree that this seems to be a native issue.
   
   The problem is with the Ti.UI.View documentation: it's wrong and thus confusing :)
   
   I suggest correcting it by stating that on iOS native issues prevent the fonts to be
   in real typographical units.

   I was forgetting...I have checked that stackoverflow article and I confirm it.
   The units seem to be close to 1/144th of an inch
