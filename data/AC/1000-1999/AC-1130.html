<h3>Description</h3>

Tracked the issue down to using a roaming profile on windows 7 or windows 8.
NPM fails to install thus all other components fail to work due to UNC path used for Roaming profiles at our workplace.

   [~anvil_martin] you mind sending us details about this? if we can replicate it, it would be easy for us to bypass this for future installations and updates</li>

   If I use my normal windows account, which has a group policy set and roaming profiles enabled, My documents and user profile settings are stored on a file server with a UNC path (i think it is actually the UNC path to my documents that causes the error).
   If I use my developer account on a VM, which does not have roaming profiles and stores my documents on the c:\ drive, I can install and everything works.</li>

   [~anvil_martin] please ask your IT department to help you with this, it must be the rules of your company policies</li>

   the issue is to do with appcelerator not handling UNC paths to the my documents folder, nothing to do with my ICT department.</li>
