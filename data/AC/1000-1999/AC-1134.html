   Hi ,
   I tested the issue you reported. It looks like the feature "Create a new project in OSX" in Appcelerator Studio is working fine for me. I tested this using the studio build: 4.1.1.201507141126 and OSX 10.10.3
   I recommend you upgrade OSX to the latest build and let us know if you get the error again.
   I will mark this ticket as "resolved" since I can't reproduce it. However, feel free to reopen with additional information if you notice otherwise.
