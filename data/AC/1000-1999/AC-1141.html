<h3>Description</h3>

When I have a bunch of complicated migrations to apply it looks they are partially applied - my database structure has been updated but my model configs haven't. My model has incorrect columns in the config.columns field. So when I try to save a model with attributes (where keys represent the name of new columns in the database) the new fields are not saved.

Because sqlite doesn't support dropping columns in tables so one of my migrations renamed original table, crate a new table with the original name, copied data from the old table and drop it. I think this migration can cause that issue.
