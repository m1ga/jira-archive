<h3>Description</h3>

After starting a map view, everything works fine for a while. 
If you do a lot of scrolling and zooming, you don't see any map details any more after a while on some devices (e.g. Samsung Galaxy S4 w Android 4.2.1, Oppo Find 7 w Android 4.4, Google Nexus 7 w Android 4.4 etc.).
You can still scroll and zoom, but the map stays blurry (street names still appear).

Switching between satellite and standard view doesn't change the bevhaviour.

Sometimes the app crashes after heavy zooming and scrolling.

After clearing the cache (application settings) and restarting the app, the map works fine again for some time. So I assume it's a memory issue.

In addition some users report that the performance of the map view is, compared to the Google Maps app, worse and the use of internet traffic is higher.

I attached a sample project. You just have to enter your Google API key and adapt the app id.
If you have any questions or need more information feel free to post a comment.

   I'm able to reproduce this issue. Also noticed that this issue can appear when adding annotations.
   Environment:
   Ti SDK: 3.3.0.GA, 3.2.3.GA
   ti.map module: 2.1.4, 2.1.2
   Meizu MX3, Android 4.2,
   HTC Incredible S, Android 4.3</li>

   Thanks for your reply. Our client is really annoyed in the meanwhile and we can't fix this error ourselves.
   This seems to be a serious bug and it needs a solution asap because maps are not stable and unusable currently (but they're a main component in our app).
   
   Is there a schedule for this yet?</li>

   I also can reproduce it on a Nexus 7, no matter which SDK version I use (be it 3.2.3, 3.3.0 or the most actual 3.4.0 RC). 
   On the Nexus 7 there's even the map not loading on startup. On other devices that works fine, only scrolling causes this error, but on the Nexus 7 nothing works.</li>

   Hello,

    Is there a test case to reproduce the issue?</li>
<li>Nick Clark 2014-10-15

    I'm assuming yes - see above... "We confirmed this with the Platform Engineering team." and the last update was that this was scheduled for a sprint in September. Any update on the progress of this issue would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.</li>

    See the link above "clones", they opened the old thread again. There you'll also find the example project I created...unfortunately there's no solution yet which is pretty annoying as more and more users report this issue. 
    We, as app developers, can't do anything on such a serious bug (I reported it 3!!! months ago), which is annoying too and lets me think about using Appcelerator in further projects.</li>
