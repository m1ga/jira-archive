<h3>Description</h3>

When running the app on the device, the error shows during launch:

[ERROR] :  GooglePlayServicesUtil: The Google Play services resources were not found. Check your project configuration to ensure that the resources are included.

My app doesn't use ti.map, but uses ti.cloudpush. It seems this error doesn't affect my app, but why is it there?

   Hello, This issue is not reproducible in our environment. Though this is a device issue. And also, not of Appcelerator platform issue. There are similar [post](<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18068627/logcat-message-the-google-play-services-resources-were-not-found-check-your-pr)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18068627/logcat-message-the-google-play-services-resources-were-not-found-check-your-pr)</a> on the issue in the web.
   
   We tried in various devices 4.4.2, 5.0.2, 6.0. Push notification is working fine. There are some recommandations you can follow. 
   
   1. Try updating Titanium SDK.
   2. Try rechecking your project configuration on google developer console. 
   3. Make sure your device has [Google Play services](<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.gms&hl=en)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.gms&hl=en)</a>
   
   This is a bug in the Google Play services library, and it is filed here under [issue 755](<a href="https://code.google.com/p/google-plus-platform/issues/detail?id=755)." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://code.google.com/p/google-plus-platform/issues/detail?id=755).</a> Hope this helps, Thanks.</li>
