   ok, oddly enough, I had to unplug the device and plug back in a few times .... refreshing each time, and got it to work</li>

   Glad to know that its working for you now. Also, please make sure the previous run configuration is deleted from Run Configurationsâ€¦ dialog, otherwise the previously incorrect device-id is saved and would be re-used.</li>
