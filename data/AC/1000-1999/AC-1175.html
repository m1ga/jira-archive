<h3>Description</h3>

The map won't update for Android when panning around and zooming in on a different location. Im having the same problem with both the Development key (shipped with Titanium) and the Distribution key.

It seems like the application is caching the map somehow, as the map at start (Sydney, Australia) is COMPLETELY blurred, while if I move the map to Karlstad, Sweden, the map is fine even when zoomed, a lot. Karlstad is the first location used for my map, so I guess thats why.


If I create a whole new application, the Development API key for Google maps (shipped with Titanium) works fine, but the issue remains with the Distribution key (What? Shouldn't work at all?).

app.js now contains the following, and nothing more:
//

<code><pre>
var MapModule = require('ti.map');
var win = Ti.UI.createWindow({backgroundColor: 'white', title: 'Title', navBarHidden: true});

var mapview = MapModule.createView({
    mapType: MapModule.NORMAL_TYPE,
    region: {latitude: -33.87365, longitude: 151.20689, latitudeDelta: 0.1, longitudeDelta: 0.1 }, //Sydney
    userLocation: true,
    annotations: [],
    animate: false
});

win.add(mapview);
win.open();
//
</pre></code>
Im not sure if this is an issue you can address, or if this is an issue for Google rather than you, but I thought that I'd start here and see what you have to say.

This application is currently sitting on Google Play, so a quick answer would be greatly appreciated.

Many thanks in advance.

Regards,
Jimmie Jönsson

   Hi,
   
   We tried to reproduce this issue with a sample test case. It’s working as expected with Titanium SDK 3.1.3.GA and 3.3.0.GA.
    
   <h4>TESTING ENVIRONMENT:</h4>
   
       Titanium SDK: 3.1.3.GA and 3.3.0.GA
       Titanium CLI: 3.3.0
       OS X Version: 10.9.3
       Android API Level: 17 and 19
   
   <h4>TEST CODE:</h4>
   
   <code><pre> 
   var MapModule = require('ti.map');
   var win = Ti.UI.createWindow({
   	backgroundColor : 'white',
   	title : 'Title',
   	navBarHidden : true
   });
    
   var mapview = MapModule.createView({
   	mapType : MapModule.NORMAL_TYPE,
   	region : {
   		latitude : -33.87365,
   		longitude : 151.20689,
   		latitudeDelta : 0.1,
   		longitudeDelta : 0.1
   	}, //Sydney
   	userLocation : true,
   	annotations : [],
   	animate : false
   });
    
   win.add(mapview);
   win.open();
   </pre></code>
    
   <h4>STEPS TO TEST:</h4>
   
   - Create a simple project.
   - Update app.js with test code
   - Add Map module in tiapp.xml
   - Run on android device
     
   <h4>EXPECTED RESULT:</h4>
   
   It’s working as expected.
   
   Thanks

   Hi,
   I'm having the very same problem with Ti 3.3.0 and Ti.Map 2.1.6
   
   Thanks for your efforts</li>

   Hello [~jimmie]!
   
   Can you please take a look into the posted testcase and let me know your results. 
   
   Best Regards,
   Mauro </li>

   Tested on 3.3.0.GA, works fine. </li>

   Hello Mauro Parra-Miranda.
   
   Im terribly sorry that I haven't answered this post earlier.
   
   I had bound my Jira account to a mail that I don't use that often (while thinking it was to my work mail) so haven't noticed your inputs.
   
   I also started working on a different project for a while so this project got forgotten, until now. 
   
   I've tested the test case, and it works as expected. Although, while running my old code, the map no longer loads at all until you zoom out, and then the whole map is all blurry (and by "all blurry" I really mean blurry, you can't see a thing, only like.. silhouettes of countries)
   
   This is when I run the application via Titanium on Android Device. If I remove the Application, and instead download it from Google Play, it works fine again.
   
   I have no idea if it will come back eventually, but it works for now. 
   
   Thank you.
   
   Regards,
   Jimmie</li>
