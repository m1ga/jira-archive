<h3>Description</h3>

I work on Titanium for Mac, and have developed a small test application, but it times out almost every time I compile and run the application on iOS simulator or android emulator. 
Also I am not able to run the sample Kitchen Sink application in Android emulator, since it contains Google APIs, and my android SDK doesn't support it. But as far as I know I have downloaded google APIs and also I have all the android SDKs from 3.0 to 4.4.

Please suggest me solutions to the two problems I mentioned above.

   Please let us know the Titanium (SDk + Studio + CLI) version you are using. Also, were you able to run your application on device? Sometimes the emulators/simulators are slow and you may want to start them first and then run you application.</li>

   Titanium studio version 3.0
   iOS simulator 7.0
   Android Emulator Platform 4.4.2, API Level 19
   I am not aware of what is Titanium CLI? Can you please explain? I did the usual installation from the setup file available at appcelerator.com.
   
   My device is Samsung GT I9300, it was connected to the machine, but Titanium Studio does not detect it and prompts "There are no Android devices connected", so I was not able to run the application from the Titanium Studio. But I was able to install the .apk file from the build folder of the Application in the Titanium workspace folder.
   
   Please help me with the following issues I am facing:
   1. Application times out on running it on Simulators.
   2. Android SDKs does not support Google APIs, is there something extra I need to do? I assume 4.4.2, API Level 19 is the latest API and should support Google APIs.
