But as far as I know I have downloaded google APIs and also I have all the android SDKs from 3.0 to 4.4.\r\n\r\nPlease suggest me solutions to the two problems I mentioned above.",

I did the usual installation from the setup file available at appcelerator.com.\r\n\r\nMy device is Samsung GT I9300, it was connected to the machine, but Titanium Studio does not detect it and prompts \"There are no Android devices connected\", so I was not able to run the application from the Titanium Studio. But I was able to install the .apk file from the build folder of the Application in the Titanium workspace folder.\r\n\r\nPlease help me with the following issues I am facing:\r\n1. Application times out on running it on Simulators.\r\n2. Android SDKs does not support Google APIs, is there something extra I need to do? I assume 4.4.2, API Level 19 is the latest API and should support Google APIs.\r\n",
