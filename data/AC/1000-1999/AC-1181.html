   "NOTE: The following Android information has been detected using the old environment detection logic. To display more accurate information, install and select a Titanium SDK 3.2 or newer." indicates an older Titanium SDK but "Titanium Command-Line Interface, CLI version 3.2.1, Titanium SDK version 3.2.2.GA" indicates you already have 3.2.2 SDK installed. It appears that Titanium SDK 3.2.2 is not your default SDK. Please provide the output of the following command to diagnose this issue further.
   
   titanium sdk</li>

   This appears to be a duplicate of TIMOB-16553. This issue is resolved and the fix will be available in the upcoming release.</li>

   That's great.  Do you have an ETA on the next release.  There's been a few days already where I wasn't able to do anything with this.
   
   Thanks!</li>

   Can you please download latest 3.2.3 SDK build from the following page, make it your default SDK and check if it resolves your issue? I want to make sure that upcoming build really resolves this specific problem.</li>

    Hi updating the sdk to 3.2.3 worked for creating a project.  But now there seems to be another problem.  When trying to run the default project in the android emulator, the run configuration shows only the titanium_1_wvga800 emulator.  When running the emulator shows up but has a black screen and the Console gets stuck on "Starting app: "</li>

    We released Studio 3.2.3 + CLI 3.2.3 + SDK 3.2.3 GA version last week that addresses a number of similar issues. I would recommend you to upgrade the entire stack to 3.2.3 and let us know if the issue persists for you.</li>

    Resolving this ticket as I cannot reproduce this issue and the reporter has not followed up further.</li>
