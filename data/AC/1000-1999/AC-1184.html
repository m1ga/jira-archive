<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Steps to Reproduce</h4>
Whenever I run the update I get a message that says that the update failed.
What appears to be happening is that the apple user id on my iMac where Titanium Appcellerator is installed is presenting me with an apple login screen (for verification of the installation). The user id there is 'apple' not my actual apple user id. It is greyed out and does not allow me to change it. This has never occurred before on any other Titanium Appcellerator upgrades.

<h4>Actual Result</h4>
'errors during install' message and nothing works in Titanium Appcellerator. Seems that the install disabled my application. If there is an issue with licensing, send me a message.  I downloaded this and installed it ligitimately.  I've even spoken at least twice to one of the Titanium employees.

<h4>Expected Result</h4>
I expect to continue using Titanium Appcellerator after installation is complete.

   Hello,
   
   
   - If you are  OS X Maverics go to "Settings/Security&Privacy/Privacy/Accessibility" - Enable Titanium to control your computer. Then close Titanium Studio, and then reopen it. 
   
   If you still having issues after doing that, please make your account admin. 
   
   Best Regards</li>

   Hello,
   other comments on this:
   
   From your log, likely your npm is broken. Open a terminal and run (as administrator/ root): 
   
   npm cache clean
   
   after that, try to update again. 
   
   According to the docs, your Mac OS X version might be a little bit older to run Ti Studio: <a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/3.0/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/3.0/#</a>!/guide/Setting_up_Studio-section-37540095_SettingupStudio-MacOSX
   
   But let me know what happens after you npm cache clean. 
   
   Best Regards</li>
