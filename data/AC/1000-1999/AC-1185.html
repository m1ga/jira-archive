<h4>Actual Result</h4>
iOS was not recignised as being installed by titanium.

   I looked at your log files and couldn't see the Xcode version. Please take a look at the documentation guide and also the supported version of Xcode with Titanium SDK.

   Also, please attach the output of the following command to diagnose the issue further
   
   ti info -t ios</li>

   Hi Ritu,
   
   Please see the below information.
   
   Titanium Studio, build: 3.2.3.201404181442
   Xcode Version: Version 5.1.1 (5B1008)
   ti info -t ios gives this message: FATAL ERROR: Error: Unable to parse config file
   
   I checked the link that you gave me and this seems to be ok.
   
   Thank you for your help.

   I have uninstalled Xcode but I am getting this from titanium.
   
   Please see the attached screenshots.
   
   It appears to be finding Xcode even when it is not installed. I have also used app cleaner to remove Xcode and the problem still remains as shown. Errors are being thrown up by Titanium when creating a new project. It is like something is not installed correctly.
   
   I have checked Java and Node.js and they are installed, I uninstalled titanium studio with app cleaner also to remove any files which may have been missed.
   
   I hope this is enough information for you.</li>

   I tried to install the Tizen SDK. This installed ok but when I tried to create a project I got an error with the configuration file. It seems like there is a configuration problem with Titanium itself even though I have installed it completely from scratch a couple of times now.</li>

   Can you please attach the output of the "titanium info" command from the terminal? This will help us diagnose the issue further.</li>
