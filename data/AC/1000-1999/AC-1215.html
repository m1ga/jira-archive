<h3>Description</h3>

With the sdk 5.1.1 GA the annotations don't work correctly. 
I can add them in the map but the event listener "click" doesn't work, in fact if I try to click the annotation nothing happens. Also the rightButton,rightView or the leftView,leftButton and the custom pin image don't work.

With the sdk 6.0.0.v20160206012308 only the click works (partly) in fact if I click it, in the event listener click function I can display only alert or console log. If I  try to display in console the event object the app crashes.


Another problem with the sdk 6.0.0.v20160206012308 (with the sdk 5.1.1 GA it works well instead) I can't get more than 9 results from a sql lite query or the app freezes without any error in console. In general if I use sqlite the app freezes.

Waiting for your reply,
I thank you in advance.

Kind regards,

Enea

   I've created an application "for example" that includes the map only and in addition the annotations from a db test.
   
   The query that extracts data to create the annotations with the LIMIT 1 it works out, if you try to extract more lines the app freezes.
   
   With the sdk 5.1.1 GA it works out, but with the last 6.0.0.v20160206012308 it freezes.
