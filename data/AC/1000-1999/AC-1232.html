<h3>Description</h3>

Beginning with Xcode 6, the iOS simulator directories have been moved to a directory tree rooted at <code>~/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Devices</code>.  The logger.py script still looks in <code>~/Library/iPhone Simulator/</code> for log files, however.  This results in log output not being streamed back to the console when building and testing module projects using titanium.py.

   Unfortunately, we are no longer maintaining legacy Python-based scripts including logger.py. It has been replaced by a Node.js-based library called "ioslib" which is baked into the iOS build.</li>
