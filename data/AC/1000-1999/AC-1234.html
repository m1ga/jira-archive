   Hi, 
   
   Would you please try to update studio and Titanium SDK to the latest version. See if this problem still happen.
   If yes, would you please give us your console error output.

   I ended up reverting back to a previous version of Android SDK since I am working on a critical project. I am currently working on the latest 3.3.0 version though. I will update you early Monday when I can experiment on a separate PC to verify it will work with the mentioned Android SDK.</li>
