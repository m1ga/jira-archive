   Hello Bogdan,
   
   Thank you for bringing this to our attention. Can you provide a screenshot so that I may pass this onto our engineering teams? Also, which browser did you see this in?
   
   Thank you,
   Seth</li>

   As you can see I get the same results on different pages.
   This is API bug I think (<a href="https://api.cloud.appcelerator.com/v1/push_notification/notify.json" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://api.cloud.appcelerator.com/v1/push_notification/notify.json</a> return the same results after page 500)
   
   Browser doesn't matter</li>
<li>Shuo Liang 2014-05-06

   So this is happened after 500 pages? before 500 pages, it works well?</li>
<li>Bogdan Pankiv 2014-05-06

   Yes, correct. Errors start from page 502...
   
   notify.json link is wrong. I mean <a href="https://cloud.appcelerator.com/apps/6Vd8cdmUesAItBkG" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://cloud.appcelerator.com/apps/6Vd8cdmUesAItBkG</a>
   vfWFeg43zL6Ajt0s/push_subscription.json.....</li>

   Unfortunately, I can not test this case with API directly, because UserID is mandatory there (and we don't use it). We can check this without userid only using cloud.appcelerator.com user interface</li>
<li>Shuo Liang 2014-05-06

   Can you provide us your APP key, we can check it in our database to see what happen?</li>
<li>Shuo Liang 2014-05-06

   Hi Bogdan,
   
   Just Tested and researched about this ticket, also checked the database. This maybe a paging bug during query process.
   I had filed a ticket to engineer team to fix it. I will keep you up to date about the process.

   Filed ticket to engineer team.</li>
<li>Bogdan Pankiv 2014-05-06

   Is there any way to get device tokens using API (not cloud web site)? May be there is some sort of value for UserID to get all results? (function push_notification/query.json)</li>
<li>Shuo Liang 2014-05-06

    For now, there is no any API can query all the device tokens.</li>
<li>Bogdan Pankiv 2014-05-13

    Are there any chances to get this working soon?</li>
<li>Shuo Liang 2014-05-13

    Our engineer team is still working on it. I will update newest status if they fix it.</li>
