   Hello! 
   
   I just tested with a simple testcase (printing the date of start every time) and looks good:
   
   <code><pre>
   07/30/2014 00:28:019.300 [INFO] [4702] ------------ Run MVC App ------------
   info: socket.io started
   07/30/2014 00:28:019.502 [INFO] [4702] Current Time: Wed Jul 30 2014 00:28:19 GMT-0400 (EDT)
   07/30/2014 00:28:019.517 [INFO] [4702] App started
   [PERF]  GET / 8 ms
   [PERF]  GET / 2 ms
   [PERF]  GET / 1 ms
   [PERF]  GET / - ms
   </pre></code>
   
   Do you mind to rerun your testcase and report back? 
   
   Thanks!</li>

   Tested with 3.3.0.GA, works fine.</li>

   I ran into the same problem.
   I guess this problem is due to some servers (AWS) and independent from codes on them.
   Thus, it shouldn't be closed just because one environment couldn't reproduce it.
   In my case, one-or-two-week running on cloud made this problem.
   I think frequent access to the server is also needed to reproduce this, as this problem might be related to AWS scaling or something...
   Replacing my code with the initial code produced by "acs new" also reproduced this problem.</li>
