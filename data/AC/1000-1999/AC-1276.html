<h3>Description</h3>

We are getting a lot of feedback that Titanium developers are having issues signing up on our website: they will sign up for Titanium using their email address, then they will receive the "activation code" or "Sign up code" (to their email they provide) then when they go to enter the activation code the system will reply with "Invalid sign up code". If they try to go through the process again, they system will say the email address is already in use.

   For gmail users, They should check the promotion tag, as some time, gmail will consider the active email as promotion email. 
   For all the other users, They should check the all the folder in their email account, specially spam.

   I did tell him to check his "spam" emails, but is there any way we can just manually activate hime? </li>
