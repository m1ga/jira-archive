   Something wrong with your tiapp.xml.
   
   <code><pre>
   &lt;android&gt;
       &lt;manifest&gt;
            ...
            &lt;application ... android:name="AppleakApplication"  ... /&gt;
       &lt;/manifest&gt;
   &lt;/android&gt;
   </pre></code>

   The fully qualified name of an Application subclass implemented for the application. When the application process is started, this class is instantiated before any of the application's components.
   The subclass is optional; most applications won't need one. In the absence of a subclass, Android uses an instance of the base Application class.

   For you caseï¼Œyou can simply delete the android:name="AppleakApplication" from tiapp.xml file. then the app should work fine.</li>

   Would you please try to delete all the titanium android emulator configuration by right click, and clean the project (Menu -> Project -> Clean). Then, try to run the app again.
   
   Does the phone LG work well now, only something wrong with emulator?</li>

   Here what i have when i launch 'Kitchen Sink' for example on my emulator: 
   [ERROR] :  Failed to install apk on "emulator-5554"
   [ERROR] :  Error: INSTALL_FAILED_MISSING_SHARED_LIBRARY
   [ERROR] Application Installer abnormal process termination. Process exit value was 1</li>
<li>Shuo Liang 2014-06-26

   Does it mean your phone LG work well now?
   
   You may choose trace or debug mode from console menu, then run app again to gather more information about error. The option is down right of your studio. (attached its position).</li>

   Hello [~mosaid],
   
    the Error: INSTALL_FAILED_MISSING_SHARED_LIBRARY it's because Kitchen Sink uses the maps and your emulator is not the one including the google services apk. You need to create a new emulator, with google services enabled. Or test in a device, that will save a lot of time. 
   </li>

   Hello,
   
   BTW the error in your launch is your tiapp.xml. Is there any reason why you created a custom tiapp.xml? If you create a simple app from scratch and run that, should work.
