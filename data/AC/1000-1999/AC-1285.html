   Hi,
   
   Would you please try to restart the studio and clean building the project from menu, then after that connect your device to machine and try to run it.
   Hope this will help you.
   
   Regard,

   I tried with one older project of mine. It was build with 3.1.3 GA, and this one builds well. If I change to 3.2.1 GA and 3.3.0 GA it won't. And I did Project clean in between. Hope this info helps in a way... </li>

   Fixed it myself. It looks like the problem was, that CLI titanum had old SDK version... when I selected 3.3.0.GA as my default... everything worked.
   I was able to select device inder Run Configuration. 
   
   Thanks anyway. :/</li>
