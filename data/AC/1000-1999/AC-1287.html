   I ran the command "ti info" in PowerShell, but it seems that was not a recognized command.

   Hey i got windows 8.1 also im not sure about titanium but if u still can't get a home go to http://android.develepor/ and i have done this inside the android studio it said not found also but when i downloaded 2 ways of i did it and it found it is either download the eclipse adt bundle and extract it {INSIDE THE DOWNLOADS FOLDER} and after that u can delete eclipse but take all the files and control copy paste the FULL SDK Folder into ur android so it would be for me C:/User/Chris/android=== now put the SDK FOLDER INSIDE OF THERE IT'S THAT SIMPLE">>>> Now another way is installig the Android Studio SDK.EXE File and then run insert it into the folder copy past command prompts is i think "cd.../../android/sdk" HIT RETURN/ENTER And ull be in that folder on the command line OH ALSO MAKE SURE UR IN AS THE ADMIN PROMPT then type watever ur sdk.exe is in the command line type once in the android FOLDER ON THE CMMAND AMIN PROMPT Type in<C:/"sdk -k install" LMK IF THIS GETS U ANYWHERE SO IM IN A RUSH GOD BLESS</li>

   Also firewalls can be a a issue run as ADMIN an try this for titanium to run it -k install or see if it's in there go to say its in my user folder type C:>cd../../titanium
   C:/titanium>sdk -v thats for version or insted put -k install
   here is where it should run and install if not copy the folders into ur ti folder
   
   REMEMBER IN COMMAND PROMPT " ADMINASTRATOR AND ITS " CD 2 PERIODS.. WITH / 2 MORE PERIODS .. WITH ANOTHER /TINFO OR WHATEVER FILE NAME IS LET ME KNOW HOPE IT WORKS AGAIN OR JUST COPY THE FILES</li>

   Amém... Amém...
   
   I recently had a problem, I installed the Titanium SDK that was missing, and now he does not recognize and the Android SDK or the Titanium SDK.
   I tried to set up and uninstall the tool, but I can not make him see the installed SDK.</li>
