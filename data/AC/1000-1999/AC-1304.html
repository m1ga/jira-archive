   Please run the following command from terminal and let me know the output. You may have to run it as a sudo command.
   
   npm list</li>

   Can you please confirm that you had all the setup in order to run a Titanium environment as stated in the docs.

   Hi Ritu,
   
   I'm using OS X Mavericks.  According to the doc node.js/etc should be prompted,  I do get prompted to install those and that's where this installation issue comes up.  I enter my keychain password but it wont work
   
   Is there a way to solve this via join.me or something?  That would help,
   
   Also, before this I had 3.1.x and i ran the upgrade from the TS -> help -> updates
   
   Thanks,
   Prashant

   Titanium Studio installs npm behind the scene but it appears to be failing for you. Can you please try downloading and installing npm yourself before launching Studio to complete the installation?
