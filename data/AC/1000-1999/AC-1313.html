<h3>Description</h3>

When running the app on the device, the error shows during launch:

[ERROR] :  GooglePlayServicesUtil: The Google Play services resources were not found. Check your project configuration to ensure that the resources are included.

My app doesn't use ti.map, but uses ti.cloudpush. It seems this error doesn't affect my app, but why is it there?

   Shawn,
   
   Could reproduce this anymore with the latest release of SDK and Studio. Not sure if you still get this error. If so, we can revisit this.</li>

   My app uses Push Notification. Just use your push notification sample to reproduce this issue. Thanks.</li>
