<h3>Description</h3>

@ricardoalcocer asked me to file this bug.

This happened to us after a lot of updates, and also the last one.

It starts with Studio announcing the availability of an update. So the last one was there a while, and I installed it today. It contained new versions of Studio, Alloy and the Ti SDK (3.3.0 GA).

After clicking on update now, accepting the readme and licenses, it start working, restarts studio and complains about Android not being configured. This happens with every upgrade.

So I removed studio from the computer, through the configuration panel, and reinstalled it. But the problem remains: "Problems detected with the SDK settings". When you try to configure android, it downloads all the SDK's that are allready there, say it's configured correctly, and complains about not finding it.

We found that updating Android through the SDK manager works better then through Studio, but it did not help either. 

Titanium CLI could not start either because of not finding the configuration file.
After chatting with Ricardo on twitter he came up with deleting the ~/.titanium folder. This worked like a charm: both CLI and Studio started working again.

Stuff like this happened to us with a lot of updates. Now I know we must just delete the .titanium and refresh the configuration....

   Hi ,
   I tested the issue you reported. It looks like the feature " *Automatic Update Appcelerator Studio*" is working fine for me. I tested this using the studio build: 4.1.1.201507141126 , Appcelerator Command-Line Interface, version 4.1.2 and SDK 4.1.0 GA
   I recommend you upgrade studio to the latest build and let us know if you get the error again.
   Thanks</li>
