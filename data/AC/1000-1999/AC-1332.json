		"description": "@ricardoalcocer asked me to file this bug.\r\n\r\nThis happened to us after a lot of updates, and also the last one.\r\n\r\nIt starts with Studio announcing the availability of an update. So the last one was there a while, and I installed it today. It contained new versions of Studio, Alloy and the Ti SDK (3.3.0 GA).\r\n\r\nAfter clicking on update now, accepting the readme and licenses, it start working, restarts studio and complains about Android not being configured. This happens with every upgrade.\r\n\r\nSo I removed studio from the computer, through the configuration panel, and reinstalled it. But the problem remains: \"Problems detected with the SDK settings\". When you try to configure android, it downloads all the SDK's that are allready there, say it's configured correctly, and complains about not finding it.\r\n\r\nWe found that updating Android through the SDK manager works better then through Studio, but it did not help either. \r\n\r\nTitanium CLI could not start either because of not finding the configuration file.\r\nAfter chatting with Ricardo on twitter he came up with deleting the ~/.titanium folder. This worked like a charm: both CLI and Studio started working again.\r\n\r\nStuff like this happened to us with a lot of updates. Now I know we must just delete the .titanium and refresh the configuration....\r\n",
