<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Steps to Reproduce</h4>
Launch Studio 4.0.0, wait until 'Dashboard' is loaded.
Note in upper right corner of view a 'Sign In' button is available.

<h4>Actual Result</h4>
Launch Studio 4.0.0, wait until 'Dashboard' is loaded.
Note in upper right corner of view a 'Sign In' button is available.

<h4>Expected Result</h4>
Launch Studio, wait until 'Dashboard' is loaded.
Note in upper right corner of view a 'Sign In' button should be replaced with 'Sign Out' button. Implication is that Studio 4.0.0 has performed a 'single sign on' to dashboard and the user would not have to enter credentials again to get into dashboard.

   Hello,
   
   Please use the latest Studio version. In the latest version, when you login to the studio you are automatically logged in to the dashboard as well.
   
   Thanks.</li>
