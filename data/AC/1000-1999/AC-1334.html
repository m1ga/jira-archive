The getAllResponseHeaders method on HTTPClient returns an empty object on Android. It used to return an object with all headers.

   Hi,
   
   Can you tell me what kind of device did you use to reproduce the problem, as I can't reproduce your problem.
   And also you can try different url, as some url may not have headers.

   I was using a Samsung Galaxy S5, running 4.4.4. The API is a known internal API which definitely has headers. 
   
   Thanks,

   Thanks for reporting the issue. We tested this but we could not reproduce it. Please try out our latest Studio and SDK and test again. If you still run into the same error, please reopen this ticket.</li>
