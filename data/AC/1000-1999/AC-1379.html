<h3>Description</h3>

I'll try to create a simple animation with opacity.

Steps:
1. Create imageview,
2. Animate using this code
$.Arrow.animate(
{ opacity: 0.2, duration: 800 });

we have multiple Views in the app
View 1: has an animation sequence: animation is started
User switches to View 2..3...
comes back to View 1:
Now in View 1: the animation sequence is re-initiated and hence causes disruption

the question is:

1. Is there a way i can stop (complete doesn't work) the animation and restart it when the views are switched? If so how would I approach this where do i stop/start the animation (what event) for this to happen? HOW (what command) do I use to stop/start the animation?
Please let me know and I appreciate this in advance!!

There's no limit as to how many times the user will comeback to the animation view.. they can go in and out, switch to different apps and relaunch the app, at all these points the animation is restarted in the view.
THANKS
Prashant
