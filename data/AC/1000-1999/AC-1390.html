<h3>Description</h3>

I want to publish my app on Apple Store. I completed all needed steps to make build and its their in XCODE -> Windows -> Archive. 

But when i am going to validate my build, i got below error.
"the bundle is invalid. new apps and updates submitted to the app store must be built with public"

So how am i going to solve this issue.

Even i tried to open build in XCODE and Archive it but still i am getting below error:
[ERROR] :  Invalid "--developer-name" value "iPhone Distribution: CybApps Development ltd. (JH5QHNV5PX)"

[ERROR] :  Invalid "--pp-uuid" value "F8F66699-2C08-49C0-B593-B709B03F4EBD"

For help, run: titanium help build

Command /bin/sh failed with exit code 1

Its very urgent to publish my app to Apple store.

Please help me to resolve this issue and i will publish my app.

Thanks

   Hello Karan! 
   
   Are you using Xcode 5.1.1? Check this from Apple:
   
   Starting May 15, 2014, new apps and app updates submitted to the App Store must be built with Xcode 5.1.1

   Hello Karan,
   do you mind to take a look into this?

   Hello,
   
   I downloaded XCODE 5.1.1 and this issue solved.
   
   Previously i have XCODE 5.1, that is why it creates problem.
   
   This problem solved.
   
   Thanks,
