   Hi Ritu
   
   I might have a usefull work around for it. It looks like the issue was simulator sdk was sat to 7.0.3 and I had no other options then that. So I used xCode to download iOS SDK 7 and 6.1 and when starting "Run Configurations" through TS I still only had 7.0.3. 
   
   What worked for me was to download a older version of TS (Titanium Studio 3.1.3) from <a href="https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/tis/Reverting+to+a+Previous+Version" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/tis/Reverting+to+a+Previous+Version</a> after overwriting my current version I was able to enter "Run Configurations" where I now have the option to select all installed iOS SDK's After setting SDK to 7.1 everything is working fine. I even updated my TS back to the latest version and everything still work. 
   
   I'm not sure why this happend, but it looks like the sdk configurations section is not collecting the latest installed SDK's.
   
   cheers!</li>
