This different approach appears so far to result in Titanium not blocking callback handlers. \r\n\r\nWe are still testing this different approach yet we are optimistic this will mean this issue can be closed and we will release updates to our modules if it all works as expected. \r\n\r\nThanks, \r\nJohn",

The corner case where BLE / iBeacon callbacks from iOS can restart an app into the background that was previously killed off by iOS not responding as expected is now solved through our improvements to the modules themselves. \r\n\r\nWe have submitted the updated modules to Appcelerator for approval to the Marketplace. Version 1.2.5 of each the [BLE iOS|https://marketplace.appcelerator.com/apps/3834] ,  [BLE Android|https://marketplace.appcelerator.com/apps/6611] , and [Beacons for iOS & Android|https://marketplace.appcelerator.com/apps/7619] modules will include the improvements. \r\n\r\nYou can close this issue.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nJohn",
