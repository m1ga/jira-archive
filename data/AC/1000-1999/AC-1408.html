<h3>Description</h3>

I want to use some module that use barcode to scan images from the camera. I have tried to use different modules and It hasn't worked.
I work with Titanium SDK 3.5.0.GA, and with this version neither com.mfogg.barcode (<a href="http://gitt.io/component/com.mfogg.barcode)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://gitt.io/component/com.mfogg.barcode)</a> and tibar (<a href="http://gitt.io/component/tibar)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://gitt.io/component/tibar)</a> modules builds. It appears the error: 
** BUILD FAILED **
[ERROR] :  The following build commands failed:
[ERROR] :  	Ld build/Test.build/Debug-iphoneos/Test.build/Objects-normal/arm64/Test normal arm64
[ERROR] :  (1 failure)
I've tried to update xcode project to 64 bits and it still doesn't work.
With the Titanium SDK 3.4.1.GA it works perfect.

I've tried to use another barcode modules, like ti.barcode, but in this case the module scans well but I can't cancel or push any button from the screen.

Any solutions? Any update module that use barcode? 

I also tried without exit com.acktie.ios.barcode (<a href="http://gitt.io/component/com.acktie.mobile.ios.barcode)." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://gitt.io/component/com.acktie.mobile.ios.barcode).</a>

All those problems only happen on iPhone.

Thank you.

   Hello,
   
   I have worked on your issue. Try using this [Module](<a href="https://marketplace.appcelerator.com/apps/6102?restoreSearch=true#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://marketplace.appcelerator.com/apps/6102?restoreSearch=true#</a>!overview) from marketplace. It's free. I have tested this with Ti SDK 3.5.1.GA. It's working excellent in both iOS and Android platform.
   
   Hope this helps. Thanks.</li>

   Hello,
   
   First of all, thanks for your answer.
   
   I've downloaded and used this module and It works fine in both platform and with the last SDK of Titanium, but when I've tried to scan some barcodes it has masked the first numbers of the barcode.
   I've read in webpage that this module is free for download but you need a license key for the entire use of this. I was looking any free module, not paying.
   The idea I was looking for it was that, but the module should be free.
   If you know any other module or something like this I would be grateful. 
   
   Thanks again.
   
   Best regards.</li>
