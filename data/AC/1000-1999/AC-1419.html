Hello,

I want to implement Parse Push notification for iOS and android.
For that i found below module:
<a href="https://github.com/programmerdave/Titanium-Parse-Module-PreReleases" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/programmerdave/Titanium-Parse-Module-PreReleases</a>

When i am trying run the application in device it gives me this error:

   Please follow the below suggestion for your problem.
   
   1. Make sure the project is created with the same user who have registered or purchased this module. 
   2. Titanium Login and the Module download should be in Same Login.
   3. Restart the studio and clean the project. </li>

   Hello Shuo Liang,
   
   Thanks for quick response.
   
   1. Yes i created project with same user and in Titanium Studio i am using same appcelerator account.
   2. I downloaded module directly from GitHub. 
   3. I clean build and restart Titanium Studio, but still problem not solved.
   
   If you want then i will give you my appcelerator ID.
   
   Please help me what is wrong?
   
   Thanks</li>

   Here is another suggestion may help you.
   1. create a new app in our studio.
   2. Copy the guid of new project from tiapp.xml
   3. Use the new guid to your current app.
   4. clean the project and run the app again.

   Hi,
   
   I tried with new project. And then upload module and run app first time. But still it shows same error. 
   
   Very confused What's wrong with that.
   
   May be the module not available in Ti Marketplace. That is why this problem comes?
   
   Thanks,
   Karan</li>

   Hello!
   
   Since you are having an issue with a module from a github, you might need to contact the author of the module. It is likely that he needs to provide a different module for you, so it won't check with the marketplace.
   
   The module in the github might have the same GUID that the one in the marketplace. And if you did not get the module from the marketplace, it will identify it as a violation of the license. 
   
   Best Regards</li>
