   Ok I was wrong about that it does not exist, it exists but it was translated into my native language... But still, why is it searching there? It is not allowed to read that directory but the scan does not check whether it is even allowed to open the folder.</li>

   Can i do something to support the failure search? As you might estimate, the Todo List project is one of the basic ones which are delivered with titanium. Anyhow, as long as "titanium info" fails I guess it is a general problem?</li>

   The install needs to run as administrator, as well the CLI. </li>
