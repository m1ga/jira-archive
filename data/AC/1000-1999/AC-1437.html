Unable to update data in cloud because original admin was deleted.
Reported this last year, any changes or do I have to start a new project, export data into another database and re-populate?

   Hello Keylo!
   
   Hey, we will need more information on this. 
   
   - Original admin user.
   - Which was your cloud id app?
   - Do you have a written release of the previous admin? 
   
   Please don't put this info here, since it will become public. Drop me a line to mpmiranda@appcelerator.com so we can contact the Cloud team about this. 
   
   Best,
   
   Mauro </li>
