<h3>Description</h3>

I am trying to build an application that controls the microphone.  I was having difficulties with 3.4 on iOS 8 and so I downloaded the 3.5 beta with its new capabilities.

However I am still unable to get the recording to start.   Although I don't get any errors when I issue the start method and then check the recording property it is not set to true.

the code required to make this work in our application is split across three classes, however the code to start the recording can be found in the AudioRecorder.js in the method (StartRecording).  The audio recording request can be found in RequestAuthorisation in the CommonDialog class (found in settings.js).

I don't have an ios 7 device to test whether 3.4 works (although I have taken the 3.4 code out now).

   Hi,
   
   First of all, would you please try to use the stable version of SDK -> 3.5.0.GA, see if the problem is still there.
   
   Then, if yes, please try to reproduce you problem with a simple test case, not with many files.
   That will be really helpful to address the problem. Thanks
   
   Regards,
   Shuo</li>
