		"description": "From Google Analytics, we can see that this problem accounts for about half of the crashes for our Android app. However, there are no certain steps that we can take to reproduce this behaviour because it happens right after opening the app (or clicking the \"Run\" button in Titanium Studio). There are no user interactions before the app crashes with an alert that tells us the app has stopped. It's not likely the code we have written for our app either because the stack trace (which I've attached as a Word document) does not show any involvement of our code. We've searched this up in the Appcelerator QA forums as well as other developer forums and could not find an answer to this issue. It doesn't look like there are any other tickets like this either.",
