<h3>Description</h3>

When I add the remote-notification UIBackgroundMode to tiapp.xml, opening the app immediately after a push notification arrives results in a black screen. The app continues to run (confirmed by doing a test alert and logging), but the UI is missing. I have tried opening a new dummy window in the resume event, but nothing is displayed, just a black screen. If I go back to the home screen and then re-enter the app, the UI is displayed as normal. Removing the remote-notification plist settings returns the app to normal resume behaviour.

This problem has also been reported by users using background-fetch.
