   Please let us know which server you are connecting to here. It would be great if you can provide a simple test to reproduce this issue.</li>
<li>Sherin Michael 2014-04-30

   Server details can not be given because its confidential. 
   Test - just trying to connect to the server  by sending a SOAP request results in the error. 
   All i know about is  - <a href="http://www.appcelerator.com/blog/2012/11/the-titanium-sdk-and-certificate-validation/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.appcelerator.com/blog/2012/11/the-titanium-sdk-and-certificate-validation/</a>
   So wanted to know if there is any settings be changed in order to bypass the TLS checking from the titanium studio , other than upgrading the server. </li>

   Have you tried setting tlsVersion, in your application using setTlsversion method, to the version your server supports? We do not need the actual server information but what TLS version you are running there. We also need a Titanium test case to see how you are using this functionality.
   
   <a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#</a>!/api/Titanium.Network.HTTPClient
   </li>

   What I do is 
   
   
   function makeCall(payload, callback) {
   
   	var currentReq = Titanium.Network.createHTTPClient();
   
   	currentReq.onload = function() {
   		//some code here
   }
   
   currentReq.onerror = function(e) {
   //some code here
   
   Ti.API.info("Error on Request",+e.error);
   
   }
   
   I am getting "NaN" in the console. The payload is a SOAP request.
   When I set  currentReq.setTlsVersion(1.0), the above said error is not displayed. But the request fails and am getting "Nan" as the error. The cod eworks fine in simulator 6.1 without setting  the tlsversion. Server is using version 1.0</li>

   We will not be able to diagnose this issue without a complete runnable test case and access to your server. We are resolving this ticket due to the lack of a proper test case but let us know if you can provide this information and we would be happy to reopen this ticket.</li>

   Please follow this test case:
   
   1.Create a new classic project in Titanium. (In Titanium Studio 3.2.1, SDK 3.2.2. , CLI 3.2.1, IOS  SDK 7.1 , Mavericks, Xcode 5.1)
   2. Paste the following code in app.js 
   ~
   makeCall();
   
   function makeCall() {
   	var currentReq = Titanium.Network.createHTTPClient();
    	currentReq.setTimeout(300000);
   	currentReq.onload = function() {		
   	};
   
   currentReq.onerror = function(e) {
   	var status =this.status;
   	var statusText  = this.statusText;
   	alert("Error on Request",+e.error);
   };
   currentReq.open("GET", "<a href="http://developer.appcelerator.com/assets/img/DEV_appteam_photo.png" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://developer.appcelerator.com/assets/img/DEV_appteam_photo.png</a>");
   	currentReq.send();
   }
   ~
   3. Run the project in IOS 7.1 simulator.
   
   You will get the "status" 0, which indicates the "UNSENT" request.In the console, the given error will be displayed.
   
   The same problem is seen even if no request is sent. Just create a new project and try it in the given environment, and you will get the same error regarding connection to the Analytics. I have attached a screen shot of the error .</li>
<li>Ritu Agrawal 2014-05-12

   I tried your test case and it runs just fine with 3.2.3 GA release. I added an alert to unload function and it gets called correctly. Your test is using HTTP and not HTTPS protocol so TLS or SSL should not be in play anyway.
   
   Note that your console error is unrelated to your test as it is a warning about sending app analytics to Appcelerator server that uses HTTPS.</li>
