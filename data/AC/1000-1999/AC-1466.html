<h3>Description</h3>

My titanium studio has been working perfectly these past few weeks. I open up titanium today and attempt to run my app again and the iOs Simulator refuses to launch. I get this error:

   Hello,
   
   please close all your apps, then try it again. This looks like your mac was slow to show the simulator, and thus showed this issue. 
   
   Please let me know if this helps. 
   
   Best Regards, </li>

   Hey Mauro, 
   Thank you for your expedient response. I completely shut down and restarted my Mac, closing all of the open apps on the Mac as well as ensuring that they didn't reopen on launch.</li>
