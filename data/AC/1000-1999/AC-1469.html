<h3>Description</h3>

Not sure if this is a feature or a bug, but when you supply an email address, any subsequent logins after the first that creates an account if not already present, fail with the error "email already taken".  The workaround used for now was to store the address under custom_fields.  I wasn't expecting this behaviour, as it doesn't fail with "ID" already taken on subsequent logins.

   Please close.  I found there were was a rogue test account with the same email address that was created using Users.create.  When an account is created using externalAccountLogin and email address supplied, subsequent logins that also supply email address don't fail.
