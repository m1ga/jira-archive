   I have been able to scroll through hundreds of modules on this dialog box. May be those modules are on a different path? Do you have all the modules available at the same place?</li>

   Hi Ritu,
   
   The Modules are located in: /Users/currentUser/Library/Application Support/Titanium/modules/...
   
   There are more modules in the iOS/Android folders that are displayed in the snapshot. Also, when I install new Modules (they do not show in the window snapshot, but I can easily manually insert the module in the xml version of tiapp.xml.
   
   There is another folder which also has Ti Modules (for older Ti Studios) in: /Library/Application Support/Titanium (though these do not show at all)</li>

   My modules are located in the same directory as yours and I can scroll through all of them (around 100). I can see you are using the latest Titanium Studio version as well. I also checked with the Engineering team and they confirm that there is no such limitation. </li>

   Resolving this ticket as we cannot reproduce this issue and there is no additional information to diagnose it further.</li>
