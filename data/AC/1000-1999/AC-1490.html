   Deleting the file manually doesn't fix the issue.</li>

   Have you tried this more recently?</li>

   Yes. The problem happens also with the update to 3.5.0.

   Restarting Titanium Studio as root and performing the update seems to work.

   This issue also happens with update to 4.0.0

   [~fokkezb] I believe the issue is people installed as administrator, and then need to update as administrator. It appears to be a permission issue. "Restarting Titanium Studio as root and performing the update seems to work."</li>

   So could we inform users about that when we don't have permission to delete that file? Suggest them to start Studio as root?</li>
<li>Ingo Muschenetz 2015-04-23

   I don't know if that's the _only_ file that will cause that problem [~cwilliams], thoughts?</li>
