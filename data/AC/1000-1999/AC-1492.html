   We need a simple test case to reproduce this issue as the log trace is not very helpful.
   
   Also, you are using Titanium SDK 3.0.2 with Studio 3.2.3 GA. Can you please upgrade all components (Studio, SDK and CLI) to the 3.2.3 GA version and see if it helps solve the issue?</li>

   What I am trying to achieve is, I wanted to generate .apk file (distribution) so that I can upload to Google Play. So I tried the same with "Hello World" Application as well but getting the same error.
   
   I tried to change from 3.0.2 to 3.2.3 GA but getting some code error because of module so I post pond it to upgrade at this stage.</li>

   It appears to be an environment specific issue as you are not even able to build a simple "Hello World" application. I would suggest you to upgrade all components to 3.2.3 GA release as 3.0.2 is a very old release and we will not be able to help you out diagnosing those issues with that release.</li>

   Hello, Is it possible if you can provide any kind of patch to this so that at least I can prepare the Build ?</li>
