<h3>Description</h3>

Getting the following error on executing a mobile project:

Launching simulator process failed
Unable to locate the CLI executable. Please restart Studio or use Help > Check for Titanium Updates to install Titanium CLI.

This is being happening since I updated Xcode to Version 5.1 (5B130a). 
Tried resolving it by uninstalling alloy, node, acs and titanium and re installing all. However, I get the same error when I run a mobile project using iOS[iPhone Mobile projects]. Need a solution asap since I'm unable to run any project.

   This is n't duplicate as indicated. I get err on CLI unlike other tickets. 
   
   Error specifies :
   Launching simulator process failed
   Unable to locate the CLI executable. Please restart Studio or use Help > Check for Titanium Updates to install Titanium CLI.
   
   I have also tried with 3.2.1 GA. No change in error. 
   
   My Titanium Studio is :
   Titanium Studio, build: 3.1.3.201309132423
   (c) Copyright 2012-2013 by Appcelerator, Inc.  All rights reserved.
   
   Build: jenkins-titanium-rcp-master-21 (origin/master)
   Date: 13 September 2013, 00:23:57
   
   When I Check for Titanium Updates to install Titanium CLI, it says no updates found.
   
   I guess it's not able to read cli reference files from some folder. I'm not sure how to resolve it.</li>

   Xcode 5.1.0 is not supported with 3.1.3 or 3.2.1 SDK. You need to use Studio 3.2.1 + CLI 3.2.1 + SDK 3.2.2 to use Xcode 5.1.0 as that is the first release that supports this Xcode version.
   
   Please refer to the following blog post:

   Now I tried with other version of studio :
   Titanium Studio, build: 3.2.1.201402041146
   (c) Copyright 2012-2013 by Appcelerator, Inc.  All rights reserved.
   
   Build: jenkins-titanium-rcp-master-95 (origin/master)
   Date: 04 February 2014, 11:47:38
   
   with SDK 3.2.2. In this I get the same when I create new mobile project itself. </li>
<li>Ritu Agrawal 2014-03-18

   Let us know the SDK version you have specified in tiapp.xml file.</li>
<li>Kirthika 2014-03-18

   When I create project both the Titanium SDK Version gives the same error. ie. 3.2.2 GA and 3.2.1 GA as well.</li>
<li>Kirthika 2014-03-18

   Resolved by myself.
   Thanks for the exact configuration specification. 
   
   Voting up in - Xcode 5.1.0 is not supported with 3.1.3 or 3.2.1 SDK. You need to use Studio 3.2.1 + CLI 3.2.1 + SDK 3.2.2 to use Xcode 5.1.0 as that is the first release that supports this Xcode version.
   
   Resolved by :
   
   in /usr/local/etc/bin/ when I typed *ti --v* it showed *3.1.2*
   
   then I tried uninstalling Studio and gave *sudo npm uninstall titanium*. It produced:
   
   *npm WARN uninstall not installed in /usr/local/etc/bin/node_modules: "titanium".*
   
   then I gave *npm set prefix /usr/local* and then *sudo npm install -g titanium*
   
   finally when i gave *ti --v* it showed *3.2.1* And then I restared Studio and all worked perfectly.
