   Case is very simple 
   
   Log in to cloud.appcelerator.com, go to "My Apps", then "Manage ACS" of any project, then "Push Notifications > Show Subscribed Devices" and activate any filter (channel, type, user id) and click "filter" button. This will never finish (some type of javascript logic error I think).</li>

   [~mpmiranda]ï¼Œwe may need consider reopen this kind of ticket as ClOUDSRV ticket is all private level, community users do not have right to access it. and also can not track the status. </li>
