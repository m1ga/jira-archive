<h3>Description</h3>

A strange and serious problem detected some days ago: some of my existing data in ACS appears with "undefined" ids, which is impossible due that I can't change it.

Is there any issue related this? I cannot edit or delete them because are undefined. 

Three of my projects are affected by this issue. What the hell means this? I cannot manage those data because I can't access them! It's really a serious problem.

It happens on a Custom Object, named *Messages* (I know there is a legacy object named Messages, but there is no restrictions about the name of Custom Objects, or it is?

I need some help with this...

   15 days after this issue and no comments? This is really a serious problem, I can't remove/update any of those undefined items!!</li>

   Please provide your app key, we can check it from our backend. For security reason, please send it to my email: sliang@appcelerator.com
   
   On the other hand, please try to use curl command to query those custom objects, see if you can get correct data.<a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/arrowdb/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/arrowdb/latest/#</a>!/api/CustomObjects-method-query</li>

   Done, thanks.
   
   I got data from ACS.Custom.query() method (in Node) and from curl command: same results, ID is "undefined" in some records and not in others, just like you can see in the ACS console.</li>

   Hi,
   
   This issue is a little complex. And I will file a bug to cloud team, see if there is something they can do.

   Hi,
   
   The problem should be fixed now. Would you please confirm that from your side.

   Hi Shuo, that's right, now I have again IDs for all my records... in the production side and for the project I gave you the APP Key.
   
   I will pass you the other App Keys to your email so you can fix them also. Could you explain a bit here (or to my email) what was the problem and if it can happen again?
   
   And thank you for your help. :)</li>

   Hi
   
   Problem should be fixed on your three apps (both environments), please confirm that. Sorry for the inconvenience.

   Thank you Shuo, now all is fixed. This was a frightening problem.</li>
