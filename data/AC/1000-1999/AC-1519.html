<h3>Description</h3>

I have an app that functions in 2 modes.  One is a single-user mode and one is a multi-user mode.  Depending on which mode is selected, there is a different "main" screen of the app.

When the app loads, the "main" screen looks fine.  If I switch device modes, I call .close() on the current main window and .open() on the alternate main window.  Sometimes this works fine.  Other times it seems to push the toolbar up into the status bar.

The error scenario can be seen in the attached screenshots.  I want to emphasize that the windows usually look normal, and that this scenario only happens occasionally.

   Hello,
   
   Its not a bug. If we set toolbar top 0 toolbar overlaps with the status bar, but if we set toolbar top 10 or more, it does not overlap, works as expected.
   
   Thanks</li>
