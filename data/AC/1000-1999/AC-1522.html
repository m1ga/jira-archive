<h3>Description</h3>

Somehow Titanium Studio is sometimes losing track of when it launched an Android emulator, making the development process cumbersome even with Intel HAXM enabled..

This shows itself by multiple emulator-x86.exe instances in the taskbar, and an obsolete emulator instance still running in the background.

When this happens the application will not be installed on the new instance that just spun up and I have to follow these steps to get back to a normal development workflow:

- Shutdown all emulator instances
- Shutdown Titanium studio
- Restart Titanium Studio
- Run application again, wait for emulator to boot.

I cannot seem to find any consistent behavior that would trigger this though, what does seem to happen is an error message:

<code><pre>
[ERROR] Application Installer abnormal process termination. Process exit value was 1
[Error] : Emulator failed to start in a timely manner 
The current timeout is set to 120000 ms
</pre></code>

Meanwhile, the emulator is happily running and responsive.
