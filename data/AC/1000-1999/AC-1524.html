   Hello,
   according to the log you didn't configure any xcode installation. Open Ti Studio preferences and search for iOS. 
   
   BTW, you are using a nightly build version. Try to use the GA version (from developer.appcelerator.com).
   
   Best Regards, 
   Mauro </li>

   i've gone into the preferences pane and found the IOS. i press the refresh button and nothing happens. I hit the update button and i'm taken into the App store but it shows XCode is installed and no updates...
   
   i tried to run this command from Terminal and hit refresh but still no IOS is showing up..
   $ sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
   
   I then uninstalled XCode and reinstalled and still get no IOS showing up..
   
   I added the RC branch as an update path hoping that it would allow me fix this issue. I didn't think it was nightly builds...so not sure how it got a nightly build...
   
   i've had this issue though both on nightly and from the GA build you reference above.</li>

   here is studio just spinning as it "waits for Xcode" to install.. as you can see from the spotlight search though Xcode IS installed.</li>
