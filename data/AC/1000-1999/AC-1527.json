When I turn analytics off in tiapp.xml and clean the build and reset the simulator, the app no longer leaks memory. \r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\nti create --type app -p all --id com.hello.leak --name=helloleak -u http://example.com -d ~/Desktop\r\nti build --platform=iphone \r\n\r\nopen instruments\r\nselect memory leak\r\nselect the app and hit record,\r\nobserve that responsible caller CFNetwork leaks memory.\r\n\r\nSteps to prove CFNetwork is coming from analytics:\r\nstop the simulator and instruments\r\nchange analytics to false in tiapp.xml\r\nti clean\r\nti build --platform=iphone\r\nreopen instruments and select memory leak tool\r\nobserve no memory leaks.\r\n\r\n\r\nA few more notes: this matters because Titanium should not be leaking memory by default. If this can get fixed then Appcelerator can make an interesting and true claim, which is that hello world React-Native and NativeScript (aka native leak) leak memory by default, while titanium (for now when analytics are off) does not.\r\n\r\n",
