<h3>Description</h3>

This may be hard to reproduce, but I created an adhoc build and installed on my friend's iphone 5.

Ti.Network.remoteNotificationsEnabled incorrectly said it was disabled for his device (I checked his notification center and my app was not listed anywhere).

After I removed this check from my code, it correctly prompted him for push notifications.

   Can you please provide a simple runnable test case to reproduce this issue?</li>

   I have tested on my iphone device with Ti.Network.remoteNotificationsEnabled, it works properly. 
   Please check your code logic. 
   Ti.Network.remoteNotificationsEnabled indicates whether push notifications have been enabled using registerForPushNotifications.
   so it will be set to true or 1 after you success to register for PushNotification.
   
   If you still have this problem, please provide a simple runnable test case to reproduce this issue.</li>

   I see the confusion. It's wasn't clear that remoteNotificationsEnabled indicates whether or not the user has given permissions to notifications.
   
   I was looking for a method that says whether or not the device supports remote notifications.
   
   This could be a bit clearer in the doc. Sorry for the mixup.</li>
