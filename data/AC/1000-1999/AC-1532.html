<h3>Description</h3>

Well I've tried and tried again to find the appropriate section, but apparently no one ever encounters these issues so the section hasn't been made yet, so on to my issue.
About a month back I created my appcelerator account, and after creating it, and using it to login to Titanium Studio I was asked to activate my account, when I click to activate, I'm taken to the appcelerator site and asked to sign in, I input my information and the first thing I see is a pop-up telling me that I haven't activated my account yet, and if I want to Re-send the account activation email or if I want to just "continue", after requesting a new email several times I've still to receive nothing (earliest time I requested was a week ago... and still nothing.), I'd like to know where I go to solve this, or what I need to send you guys to activate my account manually.

   Sorry I didn't think I had forgotten to include the email I used, I've edited the description to include the email, and I'll leave it down here for your convenience.
