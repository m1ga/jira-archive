   This is a known issue and the workaround is provided in TISTUD-5614. Can you please try the workaround and let us know if it resolves your problem or not.
   
   "Temporarily move all the 3.3.X SDKs out of Titanium SDK folder and verify whether after restarting Studio, it will show all iOS simulators in Run Configuration of iOS simulator"</li>
<li>Keylo E. 2014-03-12

   where would that be/what is the path? Is it ..plugins/com.appcelerator.titanium.core_3.3.. ? If so, there are none.</li>
<li>Ritu Agrawal 2014-03-12

   Just noticed you are using Titanium studio 3.3.0. The workaround is in the ticket TISTUD-6250.</li>
<li>Keylo E. 2014-03-12

   still need a path. only core folder here is com.appcelerator.titanium.core_3.1.2.1393366469</li>
<li>Keylo E. 2014-03-12

   removed files in plugins/com.appcelerator.titanium.core_3.1.2.1393366469/com/appcelerator/titanium/core/ 
   failed
   removed plugins/com.appcelerator.titanium.core_3.1.2.1393366469
   failed
   
   reinstalling com.appcelerator.titanium.core_3.1.2.1393366469
   
   what next? </li>

   [~keylo+e.] Seems you end up in the wrong place for removing the workspace specific cache files. The workaround in TISTUD-6250 mentions that the cache files should be removed from <titanium_studio_workspace>. I looked into the provided diagnostic logs, and you need to remove cache files ONLY from /Users/keylo/Documents/Titanium_Studio_Workspace/.metadata/.plugins/com.appcelerator.titanium.core/*
   
   The files in /Applications/Titanium Studio/* should *not* be removed/modified in order for Studio to function without any issues.</li>
<li>Keylo E. 2014-03-12

   how do I find/access the cache files?
   </li>
<li>Praveen Innamuri 2014-03-12

   I have already mentioned the path is /Users/keylo/Documents/Titanium_Studio_Workspace/.metadata/.plugins/com.appcelerator.titanium.core/*</li>
<li>Keylo E. 2014-03-12

   I'm sorry, I cannot see the files. I'm searching in the finder, in Titanium_Studio_Workspace. I've tried all configurations and cannot find an option for viewing the cache files. Online searches suggest CLI methods for eclipse but my stabs in the dark have not produced results, nor would I know how to delete a specific file would I have found the root as I am not familiar with CLI. Are you able to walk me through finding (and if CLI deleting) the file. 
   
   Thank you for your patience and help. This is just as frustrating for both of us.</li>

    What is the workspace used by your Studio ? If you don't know the workspace location, launch Studio and then, open 'File > Switch Workspace > Other'
    A dialog prompt shows the workspace location used by Studio.
    
    Then remove the files in the folder <workspace>/.metadata/.plugins/com.appcelerator.titanium.core/*</li>
<li>Keylo E. 2014-03-13

    got it. These were the steps.
    To show files, in terminal:
    defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles -boolean true
    killall Finder
    
    In Studio:
    Project Clean, 
    Run Configurations > delete (Titanium iOS simulator)
    Close Studio 
    
    follow steps at TISTUD-6250
    
    Note, if Studio is not closed before deleting, does not fix.
    
    Thanks for your time.</li>
