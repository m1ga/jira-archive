<h3>Description</h3>

In the analytics dashboard, the value for installed applications is much lower than the figure on iTunes connect or Google play.

Is this because install event is only generated when the app is launched?

   The number of downloads from the app store is not expected to match the number of unique devices that run an application. Reasons include but are not limited to the following:
   
   1. A user can download an app once, and install it on multiple devices. For example, if a family has 3 iPhones and 2 iPads, and they share applications through iTunes home sharing, then there will be one iTunes download, and five users in Appcelerator analytics. 
   2. For applications built before Titanium Mobile version 3.3.0.GA, if a user deletes an application, and later re-downloads a previously installed app, there will be two separate downloads from the app store, but the number of users in Appcelerator analytics will not change because the machine ID will have been seen before.
   3. When a new version of the app is released, many users will upgrade by downloading the new version. However, the downloads that are actually upgrades, and will not count as new installs in Appcelerator analytics.
   4. A user may download an application and never run it, or run it when the device has no network connectivity to send analytics events. </li>

   Hi ,
   This is not a valid bug.The number of downloads from the app store is not expected to match the number of unique devices that run an application.
