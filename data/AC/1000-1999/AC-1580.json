		"description": "Hi All,\r\n\r\nFacing some weird issue and not able to solve, \r\n\r\nBelow is the issue,\r\n\r\n\t- I have multiple projects in my Workspace and they perfectly working fine, In my mac machine and i am able to share my iOS app file to Enterprise Store also through Publish Option too.\r\n\t- Recently for one of my project is one project and then shifted this project as separate project in GIT. \r\n\t- We downloaded the new project from git and imported it in to my Workspace. But from then i am not able to Run the App. the Run Option is disabled and cannot see any option to run the App. Then i run the App in command line by using the below command \r\n\t\t \"ti build -p ios\" \r\n\r\nI am able to run it in Simulator. I can runt is device also by Right clicking the \"Run Configurations\"\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- Will get some pop and then Browse my project under   \"Titanium iOS Device\". Then i am able to run the device. But here one issue is earlier it directly install in Phone but now i have to itunes app and install manually.  \r\n\t- But for sharing in enterprise we need to use publish button, Which is not working means i am not getting option to distribute.\r\n\r\n\r\n- For all the other Apps in the work space i am able to get, including the app which is in other project. \r\n\r\n\r\n\tSolutions I tried.\r\n\t- I compared the tiapp.xml file both are similar. \r\n\t- config file is similar.\r\n\r\nI dont understand what is the problem. \r\n\r\nCan any one help in solving and what might be causes.\r\n",
