   [~sbhambad] We need your environment information (Titanium SDK + Titanium Studio + Titanium CLI) version and OS information. Also, we need a simple runnable test case to reproduce this issue.</li>

   Thank you for providing the requested information. We don't diagnose the issue at the app level. You need to give us a simple runnable test case to diagnose the issue further.</li>
<li>Sandeep Bhambad 2014-05-12

   Hi Ritu,
   
   Can you please elaborate on the simple runnable test case bit, we are confused as to what specific information you need.
   
   This is a pretty urgent issue and is stopping us to use Appcelerator for other applications, i hope you understand that the application is in Production.
   
   We are trying to figure out if this is an app issue or a platform issue since we have seen several other appcelerator based applications having the same issues.
   
   Detailed Steps: 
   1. If you open the application, and open several other applications.
   2. Android memory manager destroys the application in the background and thus when you go back and resume the application you see a black screen.
   
   We have been struggling with a suitable fix for past few weeks and are ok to buy support if needed.
   
   Please let me know how we can escalate this issue if needed or guide us to the right contact person.
   
   Thanks
   Sandeep</li>

   Hi Ritu,
   
   Is there an ETA or workaround for this ?

   [~sbhambad] , we can not replicate this issue, we've been trying with no success, it's going to be really helpful if you can send us a simple test case replicating the issue, and also sending your logs , ti config details and the information about the device on which you are experiencing this issue.
   
   Best regards</li>

<li>Radamantis Torres-Lechuga 2014-05-21

    [~sbhambad] can you please provide a simple test case to reproduce the issue? A valid test case it's a simple small application that exhibits the issue, we can't work with your full application.
    
    Best regards</li>
