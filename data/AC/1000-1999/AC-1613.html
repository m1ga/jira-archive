<h3>Description</h3>

Dragging an annotation with a custom pin causes a replica of the original annotation to be created. The newly created annotation is now the one draggable, while the original one keeps in original position. When the dragging ends, both annotation are shown on map.

Similar problem could not be recreated when using the default pin for annotations.

   Hello! 
   Can you please provide a test case that reproduces the issue in the form of app.js? Please specify which version of the mobile SDK being used, the version of the Android OS in your device, which device, etc. 
   
   Best Regards!</li>

   Thanks for the prompt response.
   
   I am using titanium SDK: 3.3.0.GA
   Android ver: 4.1.2
   
   I have an update regarding the issue:
   I discovered that even removeAnnotation is not working when a custom pin image is set.
   
   Unfortunately I am using Alloy not the usual app. If you like I can paste XML, TSS and Js files of the problematic piece of software
   
   Cheers</li>

   After further investigation I found the bug is from the app itself not the module. The bug was due to circular annotation creation on app focus.
   
   Please mark this as closed</li>
