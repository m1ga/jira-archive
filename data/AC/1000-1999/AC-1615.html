   I want to add that also happens with accented spanish letters, like *á é í ó ú*. I suppose it happens with ASCII codes upper to 128.</li>

   When is the next deployment?
   This issue is a very serious problem.
   I can not send Push Notifications in multiple languages​​.
   If the deployment was delayed, I need to find another cloud service.</li>
<li>Shuo Liang 2014-04-24

   We are trying our best to deliver a fix as soon as possible before the next deployment. I will ask if qe can verify it tomorrow and maybe make an out of band patch. Anyway, I will give you an update tomorrow.</li>
