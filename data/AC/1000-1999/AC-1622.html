<h3>Description</h3>

My app is crashing after open five or sometimes 4 windows. The app was working fine until the latest update.

The returned error is:

{quote}[INFO] :   libc: Fatal signal 11 (SIGSEGV) at 0x00000014 (code=1), thread 2312 (KrollRuntimeThr){quote}

No memory problem. I checked. I also run another finished projects that were working fine and I have the same problem.

I attached the *styles*, *controllers* and *views* folder. Please, if you need anything else just ask me.

   Hi,
   
   Please update SDK to latest SDK 3.5.1.GA, it should fix your problem. Thanks

   Hi Shuo. Thanks for your response.
   I upgrade to SDK 3.5.1 GA, and the problem persist.
   
   I navigate trough the windows of the app and I get the same error:
   
   libc: Fatal signal 11 (SIGSEGV) at 0x0000000c (code=1), thread 3310 (KrollRuntimeThr)
   
   
   Please, if you have any other suggestions I would appreciate it.
   
   Juan Andrés.</li>

   That is weird, as I can't reproduce your problem on SDK 3.5.1. It worked well as 3.4.1</li>

   Keep navigating trough the app. Sometimes happen late.
   I tried with a different computer and I got the same error. I'm sure it will happen to you too.</li>

   Hi ,
   We tested the issue you reported. We can't reproduce it. It's  is working as expected. 
   
   I tested this using the studio build: 4.1.1.201507141126, Appcelerator Command-Line Interface, version 4.1.2 and SDK 4.1.0 GA.
   
   I recommend you upgrade SDK to the latest build and let us know if you get the error again.
   I will mark this ticket as "resolved" since I can't reproduce it. However, feel free to reopen with additional information if you notice otherwise.
   Thanks</li>
