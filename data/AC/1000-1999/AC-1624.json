		"description": "When I create a new mobile module project, both LICENSE and LICENSE.txt are created.  This is confusing to the end user.  Which one should I be using?  The README refers to LICENSE.\r\n\r\nBTW, the README seems to be pretty far out of date.  It references timodule.json, which I don't think is used???\r\n\r\nIn fact, all module-related documentation is pretty inaccurate/incomplete at this point.  There are obviously big changes happening to module structure, but the majority of the examples online are using older project structures, especially on the android side of things.  \r\n\r\nThere are files that I can't tell whether they are part of the project or if they're auto-generated.  Things like module.xcconfig and titanium.xcconfig.  If it's supposed to be part of the project, it should be created when the project is created.\r\n\r\nThere's no guidance that I've seen for moving projects from this old structure to the new, so I've been building new projects and copying code from the old project to the new one.",

LICENSE file will be include it in the module distribution. That is why READMY file refers to LICENSE file. And LICENSE.txt file will be incorporated with your app at package time. So, both of the files needs to be created. \r\n\r\nThis is not a bug. Hope this helps, Thanks.",
