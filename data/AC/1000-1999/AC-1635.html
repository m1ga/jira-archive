<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Steps to Reproduce</h4>
From the Appcelerator 4.0.0GA and 4.0.2 Continuous build studio dashboard, the Android Prerequisite is grey with the option to download.  When I select Download, the wizard runs, I choose Android 5.0.1 API 21.  

Comments:  

I think this started happening after I updated to the latest release of the CLI tools.

In the preferences dialog I get an error sayting  it can't find the SDK.

Running appc ti info -t android
Gives me the 'longjohn.js' error..

//..../longjohn/dist/longjohn.js:184
        e.stack;
         ^
processImmediate [as _immediateCallback] (timers.js:358:17)

All these symptoms and searching the web make me think this is related to how node.js is configured.

I've unsinstalled studio and try to start from scratch without any changes.




<h4>Actual Result</h4>
The wizard complete successfully but the SDK is not configured. (The SDK are installed on my system via the Android SDK manager).

<h4>Expected Result</h4>
The chosen version of the SDK is installed and configured with Android 5.0.1 API 21 and I can build and run the Android version of my app on an emulator

   Hello [~abates], You need to check if the latest Android API 24 for Android version 5.0.0 is installed in your Android SDK. For that you need to go to ur Android SDK directory/ tools/ android, which will open the Android SDK manager. Check for packages to install. Install the Android SDK tools 24 or over. Restart your studio and check. Reply with your findings. Thanks.</li>
