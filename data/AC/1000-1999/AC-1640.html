   Hello!
   
   Some questions:
   
   1. Did you launch those emulators within Ti Studio?
   2. If you open the terminal, and run:
   
   adb devices
   
   are adb able to see them?
   3. Open the terminal and run:
   
   ti info
   
   please attach the output here in a file. 
   
   Best Regards
   Mauro</li>

   Mauro,
   I've been waiting for your answer for 3 (!) months. But you did not wait even 5 days. Do you think that's ok and polite?
   
   1. Have you read the description???  "... TS ... *keeps to start more and more emulator instances*"
   
   2. It was more than 3 (!) months ago. Do you think I have a time machine? But anyway I'm *completely 100% sure adb do able to see them*
   
   3. I can do that. But are you sure it'll helps somehow, taking into account that TS was several times updated since the issue was reported?</li>

    Btw, There is no option to attach files in your jira anymore. That's very inconveniently. It'd be clever to return the option back.

    [~fixplease] I'm wondering if this is still an issue and if you can help us to try to reproduce this in our side, did you try with the latest sdk? Can you upgrade your node version also? [sdk 3.5.1 with node 12 support| <a href="http://www.appcelerator.com/blog/2015/03/titanium-sdk-3-5-1-ga-now-available-with-node-0-12-support/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.appcelerator.com/blog/2015/03/titanium-sdk-3-5-1-ga-now-available-with-node-0-12-support/</a>]</li>

    Hi Radamantis,
    This is still an issue as the bug in avd.js is still not fixed. I'll upgrade node. But I doubt it'll help as the problem is located in Titanium's script.
    
    Thanks</li>
