<h3>Description</h3>

When you build and run the attached app on iOS 7.1 and hit the 'go' button, the backButtonTitle property of the second child window that is created is ignored, and the back button is rendered with the text 'Back' rather than the expected empty string. I've attached a video, so you know what you're trying to reproduce.

It seems to be the combination of opening the window without animation and having the title set in the controller code rather than in the Alloy XML that causes this, as changing either of those two factors prevents the issue from happening.

   Workarounds would be very much appreciated. In the very specific use case that led to us running into this, we can't set the window titles in Alloy XML and we can't have the window opening be animated.</li>

   Hi,
   We have tested this issue. It’s not a bug and works as expected.  You just add backButtonTitle name at app.tss file like the following code in styles folders. Hopefully Problem will be solved.
   
   <h4>Testing Environment:</h4>
   Titanium SDK: 3.2.3.GA,3.3.0.RC
   Titanium CLI: 3.3.0 –rc,
   iOS SDK: 7.1,
   Alloy:1.4.0,
   OS X Version: 10.9.3,
   Appcelerator Studio: 3.2.3
   
   <h4>Steps to Test:</h4>
          1. In attached app, paste this code at app.tss file in the styles folder.
          2. Run this code with the testing environment.
   
   
   <code><pre>
   "Window": {
       backButtonTitle: 'Back',
       backgroundColor: '#d66',
       layout: 'vertical',
   }
   
   </pre></code>
   
   Thanks.
