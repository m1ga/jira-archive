<h3>Description</h3>

This is an issue I'm having with Titanium Studio after installing XCode 7.

On day 2 of debugging, I'm not sure where to start. 

1) It all started with the bitcode issue, after updating to XCode 7.  
2) To deal with that, I installed TI SDK 5.0.1.GA 
3) But that resulted in the loss of IOS simulators to select from.  But preferences->Platforms->iOS still showed an iOS SDK HOME (And certificates and prov. profiles etc..)
4) After googling, "Refresh Devices", and facerolling for a while, I re-installed *Titanium Studio*
5) That didn't fix anything and when going to preferences->Platforms->iOS, I noticed that there was no iOS SDK HOME selected, and also upon launching Titanium Studio, I'm getting "An internal error occurred during: "Retrieving platform status...".
org.json.simple.JSONObject cannot be cast to org.json.simple.JSONArray"
6) To deal with all this, I checked Xcode->preferences->Locations->Command Line Tools to check what value to use in a sudo xcode-select --switch command .. and that didn't help.
7) So I re-installed Xcode 7, which didn't help, re-installed Titanium again, which didn't help, and installed Xcode 6.4 (and xcode-select --switch to my Xcode 6.4 location), and rebooted after almost every one of these steps.  I also tried selecting different SDKs (with a  proper <code>ti sdk select</code>).

So yeah .. SDK downloads, XCode multiple version reinstalls, *Titanium Studio* re-installs, machine rebooting, nothing.

Guys there's something very wrong with titanium studio and XCode 7.

Another interesting factoid: At about hour 10 of debugging this, I downloaded Appcelerator Studio to see if it's able to detect XCode .. and .. it can!  Going to preferences->Studio->Platform->iOS... there it is "/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer" .. I can build into simulators, all is good ... except .. when I try to build for production, the <code>appc run</code> command insists that I'm offline and refuses to continue.

   Hello,
   
   Please follow these steps and let us know if this is still an issue for you.
   
   - Logout from Appc studio clicking on the name at the bottom right corner.
   - Logout from CLI using this command: appc logout -d
   - Open studio again
   - Login
   
   If the problem still persists, try a couple of more things:
   
   - Make sure you have the latest Appc CLI from NPM: sudo npm install -g appcelerator
   - To check which version you are on, run: npm list -g --depth 0 appcelerator
   - run the setup command with debug and trace flags turned on: DEBUG=* appc setup -l trace
   
   Next, try a clean install of your Appc CLI:
   
   - Uninstall Appc CLI from NPM global path : sudo npm uninstall -g appcelerator 
   - Remove Appc CLI installed locally : sudo rm -rf .appcelerator 
   - Cache clean from NPM : sudo npm cache clean 
   - Then, reinstall Appc CLI from NPM : sudo npm install -g appcelerator 
   - Run setup : appc setup
   
   Thanks.</li>

   I am having the same issue with xcode 6.4, Appcelerator Studio 4.3.0.201509151348, and SDK 5.0.1.GA. I am building for iOS 8.4.
   I can build and run successfully by opening the run configurations dialogue and selecting run from there.</li>

   [~pchowdhury] [~rtlechuga] This is resolved - After 
   1) updating XCode to 7.0.1 (which fixes app-thinning bugs), 
   2) running some of the steps [~pchowdhury] mentioned, but applying them to Titanium Studio instead of Appcelerator Studio.  and 
   3) more experiments with xcode-select <6.4 location> and refreshing the iOS SDK Home selection screen in Titanium.
   
   
   Let's close this one.  If I run into something more specific, I'll open up a new Jira ticket.. thanks
   
   
   ignore below this line :D

   [~pchowdhury] I am not seeing this problem using Appcelerator Studio.  I am using Titanium Studio (See Jira ticket title).
   
   Appcelerator studio does not have this problem - I'm having a different set of problems with that ([AC-386]).  But please let's keep that separate.
   
   The issue is that no matter what I do, Titanium Studio will not recognize my XCode install (see jira ticket description with steps regarding what I've done).
   
   I should also note that, in Titanium studio, 
   * I logged out, closed Titanium Studio, and logged back in.  That did not help.  
   * I also <code>sudo npm install -g titanium</code>, and <code>DEBUG=* titanium setup -l trace</code> (and went through the steps of setting up iOS (option 8).  It saw my ios certs no problem.  
   * I also ran the "Check Environment" option (option 2).
   
   After these steps, launching Titanium Studio still results in this error: 
   {quote}"An internal error occurred during: "Retrieving platform status...". org.json.simple.JSONObject cannot be cast to org.json.simple.JSONArray"{quote}
   
   And Titanium Studio->Preferences->Studio->Platforms->iOS Still does not see an iOS SDK Home.  And using xcode-select <XCode 7.0 location> NOR xcode-select <XCode 6.4 location> helps.
   
   [~rtlechuga] will you help me re-open this ticket?
