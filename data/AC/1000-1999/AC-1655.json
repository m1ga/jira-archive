		"description": "This is an issue I'm having with Titanium Studio after installing XCode 7.\r\n\r\nOn day 2 of debugging, I'm not sure where to start. \r\n\r\n1) It all started with the bitcode issue, after updating to XCode 7.  \r\n2) To deal with that, I installed TI SDK 5.0.1.GA \r\n3) But that resulted in the loss of IOS simulators to select from.  But preferences->Platforms->iOS still showed an iOS SDK HOME (And certificates and prov. profiles etc..)\r\n4) After googling, \"Refresh Devices\", and facerolling for a while, I re-installed *Titanium Studio*\r\n5) That didn't fix anything and when going to preferences->Platforms->iOS, I noticed that there was no iOS SDK HOME selected, and also upon launching Titanium Studio, I'm getting \"An internal error occurred during: \"Retrieving platform status...\".\r\norg.json.simple.JSONObject cannot be cast to org.json.simple.JSONArray\"\r\n6) To deal with all this, I checked Xcode->preferences->Locations->Command Line Tools to check what value to use in a sudo xcode-select --switch command .. and that didn't help.\r\n7) So I re-installed Xcode 7, which didn't help, re-installed Titanium again, which didn't help, and installed Xcode 6.4 (and xcode-select --switch to my Xcode 6.4 location), and rebooted after almost every one of these steps.  I also tried selecting different SDKs (with a  proper `ti sdk select`).\r\n\r\nSo yeah .. SDK downloads, XCode multiple version reinstalls, *Titanium Studio* re-installs, machine rebooting, nothing.\r\n\r\nGuys there's something very wrong with titanium studio and XCode 7.  \r\n\r\n[Here's a related community post with quite a few folks reporting similar issues|https://developer.appcelerator.com/question/183149/titanium-studio-with-titanium-sdk-351-xcode-7-and-os-x-yosemite-10105-cant-able-to-see-ios-simulators-ann-ios-device]\r\n\r\nAnother interesting factoid: At about hour 10 of debugging this, I downloaded Appcelerator Studio to see if it's able to detect XCode .. and .. it can!  Going to preferences->Studio->Platform->iOS... there it is \"/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer\" .. I can build into simulators, all is good ... except .. when I try to build for production, the `appc run` command insists that I'm offline and refuses to continue.",

But please let's keep that separate.\r\n\r\nThe issue is that no matter what I do, Titanium Studio will not recognize my XCode install (see jira ticket description with steps regarding what I've done).\r\n\r\nI should also note that, in Titanium studio, \r\n* I logged out, closed Titanium Studio, and logged back in.  That did not help.  \r\n* I also `sudo npm install -g titanium`, and `DEBUG=* titanium setup -l trace` (and went through the steps of setting up iOS (option 8).  It saw my ios certs no problem.  \r\n* I also ran the \"Check Environment\" option (option 2).\r\n\r\nAfter these steps, launching Titanium Studio still results in this error: \r\n{quote}\"An internal error occurred during: \"Retrieving platform status...\". org.json.simple.JSONObject cannot be cast to org.json.simple.JSONArray\"{quote}\r\n\r\nAnd Titanium Studio->Preferences->Studio->Platforms->iOS Still does not see an iOS SDK Home.
