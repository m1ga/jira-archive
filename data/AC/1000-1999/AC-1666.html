<h3>Description</h3>

Confronting all users migrating from earlier versions of Ti with a suddenly appearing ActionBar is totally unacceptable.

For backward compatibility for migrating users showing the ActionBar must be off!
How on earth can you expect developers to invest a low of their own money into trying to fix issues that they didn't ask for! My customer is not willing to pay me for this work and off course he is right.

I had to move to Ti 3.3.0 because of a new release of the iOS version of my app. Because of this I had to update my Macs to OSX Mavericks, cutting off the 3.1.3 path.

I had already become very reluctant for updating my Ti tools because every time I do this I end up with a lot of work. This because you guys do not keep in mind that there are hard-working developers out there that simply have to update their apps without getting into a lot of migrating issues. Until now it has cost me 3 days, without getting anywhere. Or can I send the bill to Appcelerator?

This specific app must run from 2.3.5 upward.

Actionbar.hide() is not a professional solution. Adding a theme does not work for my app, and yes, I followed all the guidelines strictly! Even using the Tiapp.xml from a newly generated project having a theme without ActionBar does not help for this specific project.

What could be hidden under the surface that prevents the ActionBar not hiding?

   UPDATE
   
   I found what caused the problem.
   My app is multi platform eg. iOS and Android (that's why I use Ti). My windows are all similar in design. When I goto the next window I open it having opacity=0, the "onOpen" event animates the opacity from 0 to 1 in 250ms. This results in a smooth fading-in of the new window over the old one; a common behaviour both in iOS and Android.
   
   The effect what I notice now is a kind of zoom-in effect.
   
   I do not want themes, I will take care of that myself.
   
   You should pay much more attention to the basic grounds of Titanium and that is creating multi platform applications!!
   
   How can I get rid of Android themes? I want my clean app back!!

   Hello! 
   
   This looks more like a question for the Q&A than a bug report. For the ActionBar to hide, you can follow the instructions here: 
   
   <a href="http://www.appcelerator.com/blog/2014/08/hiding-the-android-actionbar/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.appcelerator.com/blog/2014/08/hiding-the-android-actionbar/</a>
   
   I understand your concerns on regards the migration of a version from an old version of Ti Mobile to a newer one; we have a product that is quickly evolving, therefore some breaking might occur with respect to the old API. 
   
   Please read this guide:
   
   <a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/3.0/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/3.0/#</a>!/guide/Android_Themes-section-34636181_AndroidThemes-OverridinganActivity%27sTheme
   
   in order to override the android themes.

   This is a real bug. 
   
   When going from version 3.1.3 to 3.3.0 my app does not work as it previously did.
   1) Suddenly some bar appears (first instance I didn't even know what that bar was called).
   2) After finding out that this was called an ActionBar the proposed ways of hiding it where not working
   3) After two days of try and error I found that it was caused by using "opacity" on the windows, that was not documented
   
   In iOS there are no ActionBars, so where is "multi platform" gone?
   Having the ability of using ActionBars, Themes, etc might be nice for new developments, but default this must be set OFF because it was not present in older Android versions, and you should not confront hard working developers with stuff like this:
   - which they did not program
   - cannot remove because of some hidden and not-documented effects
   - simply publishing a new version of an already existing app is very time consuming
   - are not paid for by their customers because its not their problem
   
   This is not the first time that a lot of behaviours change when migrating to new Ti versions.
   For example the following are fine on iOS on Ti 3.3.0 and Android on Ti 3.1.3 and have been broken on Android on Ti 3.3.0:
   - ActionBar displaying suddenly
   - opacity on windows cannot be used anymore
   - my app is now crashing after a startup animation, cannot find why yet, but I have to make a release!
   - listviews are displayed very differently now, there are no lines between the rows anymore
   - textfields look very different now
   
   If you migrate to a new version of Ti mobile then you absolutely must take care that migrating apps behave as close as possible to the old situation and where it does not, provide guidelines what will happen and how to solve that!!!
   
   So how am I going to fix the above issues?
   
   Best regards,
   Raymond

   Hello Raymond! 
   
   Thanks for your desire to improve the platform. Please create a bug report for each of your issues. In order to create effective bugs, so we can transfer those to the right project, follow this guide:
   
   <a href="https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides2/Reporting+Bugs+or+Requesting+Features#ReportingBugsorRequestingFeatures-BugSubmissionSteps" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides2/Reporting+Bugs+or+Requesting+Features#ReportingBugsorRequestingFeatures-BugSubmissionSteps</a>
   
   In short:
   
   1. Find possible bug
   2. Search Jira in the relevant project thoroughly for similar issues
   3. Once certain of a bug:
   -Create a Jira ticket (one ticket per bug)
   -Keep it as concise and as factual as possible
   -Include your testcase (in the form of app.js with classic titanium, so you can just create a new mobile project and paste the code into app.js)
   Watch ticket, to show your support for the ticket's resolution
   
   I recommend that we close this one, and we focus in creating individual bugs on this. 
   
   Best Regards!</li>
