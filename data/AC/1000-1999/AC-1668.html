<h3>Description</h3>

I have added an a new app icon to my project: appicon-60@2x.png

When I create an ipa for app store, the icon appears in the plist but is not copied to the ipa. App loader gives a 'missing file' error.

The project is fine, the plist is fine. What is happening here?

   Found a solution for this:
   
   I tried with a different png. Then I renamed and resized that png, as well as replacing the content. This worked although we effectively have the same icon as before. </li>

   Please make sure to comply with Apple's guidelines for icons: 
   
   "For all images and icons, the PNG format is recommended. You should avoid using interlaced PNGs.
   
   The standard bit depth for icons and images is 24 bits—that is, 8 bits each for red, green, and blue—plus an 8-bit alpha channel."
