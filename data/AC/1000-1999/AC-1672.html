   Please provide the environment information (Titanium SDK version + CLI version + Appcelerator Studio version). It would also be good to know if LiveView is not working for any application or a specific application. Please try restarting Studio and see if that clears up the connection.
   
   I tried LiveView with a simple classic sample application on iOS and it is working as expected. My environment: Titanium SDK 3.2.1 + CLI 3.2.1 + Studio 3.2.1 and OSX 10.8.5. </li>

   Had a call with customer and he gave these versions:
   
   Titanium: 3.2.1
   CLI version: 3.2.1
   Appcelerator Studio 3.2.1
   
   OS - 10.8.5
   
   He created a dummy application and live view worked with a normal build but doesn't work with his own build. Bert is on the call with me troubleshooting.</li>
