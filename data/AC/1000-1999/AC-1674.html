   when i put my window in <NavigationWindow platform="ios"> it works ok. 
   Issue is for closing</li>

   What was the resolution to this? I am having this exact same issue with Ti 3.3.0 upwards - views that should be aligned vertically on the screen appear stacked on top of one other until the window has fully opened, at which point they 'pop' into their correct position. This issue persists even when the window is part of a navigation window.</li>

   Hello [~steve_fortune], 
   the resolution was to use the workaround <NavigationWindow platform="ios"> from the reporter. If you have a similar issue, please open a new jira ticket with a testcase.

   Hi [~mpmiranda], thanks for getting back to me.
   
   Unfortunately the noted workaround didn't work. I am experiencing the exact same issue as described here and as a result one of our projects is locked in to using Ti 3.2.2. Happy to provide a test case but I feel it would make more sense to reopen this issue than create a new one.
   
   Steve.</li>

   [~steve_fortune]:
   
   Since the reporter of the issue says is fixed, I can't reopen it. Can you please create a new one with a testcase, even better if is in Ti Classic? 
   
   Best,
   Mauro</li>
