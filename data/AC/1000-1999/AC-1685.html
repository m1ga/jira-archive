<h3>Description</h3>

After installation of "Appcelerator Studio 4.1.0" archive, with forced upgrade to "Appcelerator Studio 4.1.2", and activation of the IDE, I try to install the Android tools, by the Appcelerator IDE.

If I do, I get the error message at the end of installation, in the Console / Dev Toolbox Console window pan

 and by a modal window too, that the installation failed.


All the time, in the main dark-gray Dashboard pane, there was the display

- Mobile Web - Installed (green-checked) 

- Android - Download


After 3 tries, somehow the installation succeeded, according to the modal window pane
"Platform configuration. Download, install and configure required SDKs for the mobile platform you want to develop for Android"

- green-checked - Latest Version Installed: 5.01

In the main dark-gray Dashboard pane, there is now the display

- Mobile Web - Installed (green-checked) 

- Android- Installed (green-checked) 

Is it possible to shorten the installation time by pre-installing Android SDK ( e.g by installing Android Studio which is shipped with Android SDK) ?

Sincerely
Rolf

   Hello [~hemmerling], Yes, The SDK package that comes with the Android Studio is configurable with Appcelerator studio. You Have to follow some steps. First, The Folder that contains the Android SDK comes with the Android Studio, To use that Android SDK with Appcelerator Studio, the path to the SDK must be set in the Preferences dialog. To do that,
   
   Open the Preferences dialog:
   
   1.On Windows and Linux, from the studio menu bar, select Window > Preferences.
   
   2.In the Preferences dialog, navigate to Studio > Platforms > Android SDK.
   
   3. Set your Android SDK path. Enter the path to your Android SDK in the Android SDK Home textbox or click the Configure button to navigate to the SDK directory.
   
   4.Select your default Android SDK. Select a Google APIs item from the Default Android SDK drop-down menu.
   
   5.Click "apply" and "ok"
   
   This way you can configure Android SDK with Appcelerator.
   
   Now, If in your SDK folder does not contain the necessary build tools which are required for the installed Appcelerator SDKs to develop Android apps, Then dialog will show an error "No Android SDK found in the specified folder".
   
   This means you need to upgrade and install newer Android SDK tools. Android SDK packages can be installed using the Android SDK Manager tool. which is in "Android SDK folder/tools/android". It will open Android SDK Manager tool which will show you the SDK tools are installed. And Also the newer SDK tools that you can install. Instal the SDK tools. Now Restart the studio and go to the Preferences dialog and check if the error still exist? you will see the Android SDK is configured with the studio.
   
   For more info please read through this [link](<a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#</a>!/guide/Installing_the_Android_SDK).
   
   Hope this helps, Thanks.</li>
