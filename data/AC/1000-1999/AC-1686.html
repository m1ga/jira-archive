<h3>Description</h3>

We are having an apparently random issue where users are reporting that some listitems in a listview is just white instead of content. Always at index 0, and then again som random indexes further down the listview. We are not able to reproduce this issue when testing ourselves nor when using the build in App Store, but receive several reports a day regarding this issue, and screenshots that prove this. Some report that they can get a correct listview rendering, if they restart the app, but the problem will resurface on another restart.

This is the [listview code](<a href="http://pastebin.com/uYAEJv42)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://pastebin.com/uYAEJv42)</a>, [the templates used](<a href="http://pastebin.com/eDimC4ba)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://pastebin.com/eDimC4ba)</a>, and  [a screenshot](<a href="http://www.reshopper.com/help/img1.png)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.reshopper.com/help/img1.png)</a> of the issue.

   Thank you for providing the list view code, template and screenshot. But we need exact steps to reproduce this issue. Please provide us a simple test case and exact steps to reproduce this issue and we would be happy to take a look.</li>

   I cannot provide that. As I stated in the bug report - the issue is apparently random, and it is not possible to force it to happen. It will happen sometimes, and if you restart the app, you don't see it. Later it will resurface. The dev team hasn't experienced it. I have seen it happen once a couple of times. But again - we are receiving many reports from our users on this issue, so we can't ignore it. We didn't have any issues when we used the tableview.  It might very well be linked to our use of the SDK, but I dont think it should happen in any circumstances.
   
   Nothing in the templates indicates the use of white, and as far as I understand, white is the default color of a cell, so something in the ti-sdk, will leave the first cell untouched in stead of rendering it with content. 
   
   I was really hoping you could use this information to run through your code to see if anything could trigger this scenario. Otherwise we have to revert back to tableview. </li>

   Thanks for the detailed explanation. I tried to reproduce the issue myself couple of times but no luck. 
   
   Please let us know if you have a test case anytime and we would be happy to look into it.

   This attachment highlights an issue where using ListView.separatorStyle can result in blank white ListItems.</li>

   I have this issue as well and it disappears when I remove:
   
   <code><pre>
   separatorStyle: Ti.UI.iPhone.ListViewSeparatorStyle.NONE
   </pre></code>
   
   It only reproduces on devices, about 8 out of 10 times.
   
   [~mpmiranda] [~ingo] could you have a look at this? The workaround is to not use <code>separatorColor</code> instead and set it to the backgroundColor of the list items.
   
   This issue is same as TC-4787</li>

   We are also facing the same issue, but especially on Android devices.
   @Fokke Zandbergen Can you please suggest something to fix this for the case of Android?
   This appears when I scroll down in the list, the 1st item's backgroundColor gets transparent. Now, later when I scroll down, the last item's backgroundColor gets transparent.
   I am using Appcelerator SDK 5.1.2.GA.</li>

   [~ragrawal] did you try to reproduce this on device or in emulator? If you used emulator, could you please reopen and try again using devices since that's where it is seen and I can reproduce it?</li>
<li>Fokke Zandbergen 2016-02-12

   [~prafull3313] What you describe seems a more specific variation of this issue. Can you reproduce it consistently? If so, could you please create a new ticket with a clear test case?</li>
