<h3>Description</h3>

Hello, I am trying to activate password reset system of my app. Both Titanium user component and user panel on the cloud not sending password reset emails. On mobile app I get response 200 but no emails received. On settings page of cloud while saving my SMTP information, test email received succesfully.

   Hi,
   
   Can you show me your SMTP configuration, in order to make more tests with it.</li>

   And Can you tell me which platform do you use for your app, community or enterprise?</li>
<li>Ercan POLAT 2014-03-28

   I am using Community. If you can provide me your personal email, I can send you my SMTP server info and some screenshot.</li>

   Hi, my email is sliang@appcelerator.com.</li>

   Please let me know if you still have that problem or if yes, email me about your SMTP configuration. </li>

   Please let me know if you still have that problem or if yes, email me about your SMTP configuration. </li>

   Just read your email, please try to set SMTP configuration like following:
   
    Username : programlama@akinsoft.com.tr
    Password : ***** (your password)
    TLS : True
    SMTP Address : mail.akinsoft.com.tr
    Port : 587
    Domain : www.akinsoft.com.tr
    Authentication : login
    Set Default Sender : False
    Test Mode : False
   
   (some times if your setting is a little bit wrong, but you still can receive the verify email, but other email doesn't work)
   
   If you can't make it work after changing the configuration, please email me the full setting(include password), in order to test it by me.</li>

   As there is no any response from you for one month, I will consider this problem has been fixed. I will close this ticket.</li>

   I thinks it is not our bug. Just setting problem.</li>
