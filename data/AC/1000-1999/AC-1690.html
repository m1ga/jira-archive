   Still happening.
   I know its going to crash when i open Appcelerator Studio and the Console doesn't load.
   I get a blank un-loaded console window at the bottom with 'no consoles to show at this time'.
   If i enter anything into the code window it freezes crashes Studio.
   I force quit appcelerator studio and restart... it does the same.
   Some days its fine... others its like this all day.
   
   Also... i seem to get asked for my password lots now, it feels like almost every time i log into something appcelerator i also  get requests for an auth code too!</li>

   Updated to Appcelerator Studio 4.0.0.201504241513.
   
   Still happening... this is really frustrating now, can't get any coding done.
   Regardless of restarting appcelerator or my Macbook, it just crashes as soon as i type any code.
   This cannot be related to machine resources as i have a more than powerful machine.
   It appears that some function that runs when i type code is crashing the Studio.</li>

   The logs show it's a problem in the inline API help:

   Hello, 
   
   I am facing a problem with new appcelerator studio 4.0.0. Upon opening it stuck in "validating status" screen, and hangs there. I have followed the steps in [here](<a href="https://web.appcelerator.com/product/studio)." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://web.appcelerator.com/product/studio).</a> I am running Mac OS X 10.10.3.
   
   Any help will be appreciated. Thanks.

   still happening over here. OS X 10.11.4 .
   
   It happens on multiple installations too. The only way to fix this is to reinstall it from scratch. Very frustrating every time. It usually happens when you do too many things at the same time, and it freezes. This time happened when I was switching color theme.</li>

   [~a.marcone] sorry to hear that. could you please check the Studio logs right after this happens (to be found in the - hidden - <code>.meta</code> folder in your workspace folder) and create a new JIRA ticket with all the specifics (environment, studio version, these logs)? Thanks!</li>

   Do I need to create a new ticket?</li>
<li>Alberto Marcone 2017-02-22

   still happening, very frustrating. I'm traveling right now and I had planned to get some work done and reinstalling the whole thing is not an option. Nothing written in the .meta folder.</li>
