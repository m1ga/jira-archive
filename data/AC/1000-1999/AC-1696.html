<h3>Description</h3>

Hi Team,

Where I am trying to query custom object using where field with $and condition , it returning false result for some reason.The thing is, its not occurring always , but for some time.

I am running a batch job to do a duplication check and it work fine for one or two days with correct result, but after that it fail.

here is the $conditon i am using

{
"$and" : [{
	"deviceToken" : deviceToken
	}, {
	"AlertId" : AlertId
}]
}

Have anyone faced similar issue? It will be great if there is any fix to this issue.

   Hi,
   
   I had ran many test on this, still can't reproduce your problem. 
   
   Would you please tell us what you mean about false result, there is no data return or just return wrong one. In the meanwhile, please provide the wrong data example to show your problem.
