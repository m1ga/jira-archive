<h3>Description</h3>

Updated to OS X 10.10 public beta 3. Titanium studio will not start due to JVM Shared library does not contain the JNI_CreateJavaVM symbol. This was initially with Studio 3.3, tried to install the 3.4 RC and get the same error. Java version was originally 1.7 and didn't work. Updated to 1.8.0_40 and still not working.

   This error could be due to running Studio on wrong architecture of JVM. For example, you might be having 64-bit Studio and trying to run it on 32-bit JVM. Can you make sure the architecture of Studio and JVM are same ?</li>

   How do I check architecture of Studio?</li>

   You can find "arch" details at : About Titanium Studio > Installation Details > Configuration.</li>

   It won't start though, so I can't do that. Is there a command I can run.. or a file somewhere that will tell me?</li>

   Fixed by downloading this.. <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572</a>
   
   Java -version still shows 1.8.0_40, but now it will load Studio.</li>

   Hello [~nthurston]!
   
   Does this replicate with the latest Yosemite release? I tried this and Yosemite just installed the JDK 1.6 for compatibility and everything worked perfect. 
   
   Best Regards</li>

   With the full release of Yosemite, I still had to reinstall [this](<a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US)</a> to get studio to run.</li>
