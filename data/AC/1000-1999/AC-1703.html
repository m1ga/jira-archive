<h3>Description</h3>

Hi, I have installed Favebooks and Kitchen Sink projects, but there is an exclamation sign over each project name in project explorer. I have been browsing in google and I couldn't find the way to fix it.

I would appreciate your help with this.

   Please unfold your project in project explorerï¼Œand take a screen shot for your problem, Thanks</li>

   Sure, please take a look at the attached image.
   
   Ooops I guess that I attached to the first comment.</li>

   Please keep unfolding the folder with exclamation sign over on it, until find the root problem file. open that file, you will see the warning info in main window by leave the mouse on the sign over. Like the example I upload. </li>

   Okay, there are a lot of files with warnings like that, for instance 1.jpg, the problem is in the mp4 line; however, the mp4 file is there and works well.
   Also, in 2.jpg when I move the mouse over the exclamation sign, I got the "semicolon missing" tooltip msg.</li>

   That is the normal behave. as Titan use eclipse core and it will give some warning, but not error.  and most of warning do not block any compile and build, there is no need to worry about it. So if you can run the app successfully, then it will be fine. </li>

   That sounds good, but when I try to run for instance The Kitchen Sink, I get the following msg:
   [ERROR] Application Installer abnormal process termination. Process exit value was 1
   [ERROR] :  Failed to install apk on "emulator-5554"
   
   The only app that I can run is the "Hello" that is a kind of "Hello World" that I made, and is the only one that doesn't have any exclamation sign.
   
   Thanks for your help, because I really want to learn this.</li>

   Hello David,
   
   Try running on a Actual device. See the error still present. Thanks.</li>

    Hello David,
    It is working  nicely in Mac OX [Android and iOS Emulator]. So it should be run on windows 7 also. Try to properly setup the android emulator in windows 7 and then run the project.</li>
