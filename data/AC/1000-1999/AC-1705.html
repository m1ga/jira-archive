<h3>Description</h3>

When a breakpoint is defined, execution stops but Studio doesn't load the source code. Instead it displays "source code not found".

This makes debugging a nightmare.

   Can you please attach your sample code and let us know where are you setting your breakpoints? Also, I would suggest you to update your titanium studio to build 3.2.3 as we have many bug fixes and improvements in the latest release.</li>
