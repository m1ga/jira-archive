<h3>Description</h3>

Hello. I'm new with Titanium and since I tried to use it always had the same error. It's been three days since I started triyng to make Studio work. It keeps telling me that there's no sdk at the path (the error is: "[Android SDK Home] No Android S...der the specified SDK location"). I tried uninstalling and installing everything. I also tried to change the environment variables with the correct software locations described by appcelerator. On the dashboard it says that sdk 2.3.3 is not found . So I installed it through the SDK Manager, but no success. I installed the 3.1.3 version of Studio but it might have had some troubble with the previous 3.3.0 installation and had other issues (not referred to android sdk). I decided to create a virtual machine with Windows 7 32 bits, and installed a new fresh 3.3.0 Studio. And again the same problem. Tried a few tips that I found here, and I tried with Studio 3.2.0 too... but no success either (Have not tried change environment variables here since I don't think this might help). My english is not that good... but I would be really grateful if someone could help me with this. I think appcelerator titanium would be the best choice for Mobile development.
Manuel.

   Hi ,
   I tested the issue you reported. It looks like the feature "*Android SDK*" in Appcelerator Studio is working fine for me. I tested this using the studio build: 4.1.1.201507141126 , Appcelerator Command-Line Interface, version 4.1.2 and SDK 4.1.0GA.
   I recommend you upgrade android tools (API Level 22) to the latest build and let us know if you get the error again.
   I will mark this ticket as "resolved" since I can't reproduce it. However, feel free to reopen with additional information if you notice otherwise.
   Thanks</li>
