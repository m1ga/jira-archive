		"description": "Hello. I'm new with Titanium and since I tried to use it always had the same error. It's been three days since I started triyng to make Studio work. It keeps telling me that there's no sdk at the path (the error is: \"[Android SDK Home] No Android S...der the specified SDK location\"). I tried uninstalling and installing everything. I also tried to change the environment variables with the correct software locations described by appcelerator. On the dashboard it says that sdk 2.3.3 is not found . So I installed it through the SDK Manager, but no success. I installed the 3.1.3 version of Studio but it might have had some troubble with the previous 3.3.0 installation and had other issues (not referred to android sdk). I decided to create a virtual machine with Windows 7 32 bits, and installed a new fresh 3.3.0 Studio. And again the same problem. Tried a few tips that I found here, and I tried with Studio 3.2.0 too... but no success either (Have not tried change environment variables here since I don't think this might help). My english is not that good... but I would be really grateful if someone could help me with this. I think appcelerator titanium would be the best choice for Mobile development.\r\nManuel.",

I tested this using the studio build: 4.1.1.201507141126 , Appcelerator Command-Line Interface, version 4.1.2 and SDK 4.1.0GA.\r\nI recommend you upgrade android tools (API Level 22) to the latest build and let us know if you get the error again.\r\nI will mark this ticket as \"resolved\" since I can't reproduce it. However, feel free to reopen with additional information if you notice otherwise.\r\nThanks",
