					"body": "Ok, so I was able to confirm that indeed the callback is fired when testing on the device. The problem still remains in my emulator, which right now seems a lot more buggy than just that. In fact, the airplane mode doesn't seem to be doing anything at all now. I can still make requests, use the internet, etc. even if I turn off wifi.\r\nI cannot find the airplane mode on 'General settings', only when I pull the settings panel from the bottom, but switching airplane mode there does not change the icon on the menu bar. Is airplane mode supposed to behavior nicely on the emulator?\r\n",
