<h3>Description</h3>

After creating an empty non-Alloy project (with just the two tabs saying "I am window 1" and "I am window 2"), introducing a syntax error in app.js will not show the actual error, but simply fail to run an Android app.

In my case, it was simply adding a tick ' at the end of the first line of code:
<code>Titanium.UI.setBackgroundColor('#000');'</code>

The environment just writes:
<code>[INFO] :   Processing JavaScript files</code>
<code>[ERROR] Application Installer abnormal process termination. Process exit value was 1</code>

   Hi,
   
   You can try to switch the console mode to "track" or "debug" in up right corner of console window, then it may give you more info about coding status.

   I switched to "track", but no info is shown about JavaScript syntax errors. I expected to be able to install to the device and then see the "continue-kill" popup. Some kind of notification would be great, however, at the moment, I don't think that the programmer is somehow notified.</li>

   Actually I can see the compile error when add ' in the end of that line, 
   <code><pre>
   INFO] :   Processing JavaScript files
   [ERROR] :  Failed to parse /Users/shuoliang/Documents/Titanium_Studio_Workspace/AppTest6/Resources/app.js
   [ERROR] :  Unexpected token: name (Tab) [line 12, column 11]
   [ERROR] :  
   [ERROR] :          title:'Tab 1',
   [ERROR] :      -----------^
   [ERROR] :  
   [ERROR] Application Installer abnormal process termination. Process exit value was 1
   </pre></code>
   
   This is the error casued by add ' in first line.</li>

   The app didn't get installed, according to:
   
   Application Installer abnormal process termination. Process exit value was 1
   
   Please try this again and report back when the apps is actually installed.
