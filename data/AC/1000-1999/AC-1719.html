   This is a new install of Titanium Studio.
   
   Many people report this same issue on a myriad of sites but I have found no posted solution.
   
   It is extremely dissapointing that a Titanium install cannot run a sample program. I would understand if this was a new bug, however it appears to have been around in one form or another for a couple of years. It seems like the installer does not install a working set of compatible libraries.
   
   I have tried for days to find an answer to this problem. The promise and approach of this platfom is why I have invested time in a cross platform solution. I hope you support your current and potential user community enough to take a new user's concerns seriously.</li>

   Can you send me the diagnostic logs (Help > Studio > View diagnostic logs) to investigate further ?</li>

   Dear guys,
   
   I have uploaded and installed the last revision of Titanium SDK yesterday (October 19th)
   Is there a way to bypass this bug by downgraded the Titanium SDK and/or the Android SDK ?
   Could you confirm that this bug will be also impacted when trying to run from a real Android Device ?
   
   Note: still running under Windows XP SP3.
   
   Regards,
   
   PIJACK
