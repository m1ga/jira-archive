<h3>Description</h3>

I'm getting a lot of those Mesh too large errors on iPhone since iOS6. (both on Simulator and on Device (4S) )

Although those errors are generated on the console, the Map is working fine. I'm worried with possible bugs and leaks related to this error.

It seems that the new Maps is generating those but I wasn't able to pinpoint the exact cause. Any hints?

Sample errors:
