<h3>Description</h3>

When distributing an App to iOS AppStore which has DeployTarget iPad == false in tiapp.xml the submitted app in iTunes Connect is an iPad only app. verified 3 times.

deployment targets were iPhone & android.

i need to say that we usually wanna provide an ipad app but it isnt ready for publishing. so i deactivated ipad, removed the build folder performed an additional clean & build and used TiStudios integrated distribution component.

   it relies on what is written within the manifest file. i changed it manually to iPhone now and it works but this is nowhere documented.</li>

   I'm closing this now since you resolved it. To help others in future and perhaps improve our docs, it would be nice if you could state in detail how you fixed it. By manifest do you mean a .plist entry?</li>

   To fix and avoid this problem you have to do the following:
   In our case we're going to create a universal app but for the moment there is no useful iPad app for distribution.
   For AppStore Distribution
   <h4>Ensure that you checked iPhone and unchecked iPad (check it also in tiapp.xml & in file called manifest, which is not a .plist file. it's located in project root next to tiapp.xml)</h4>
   <h4>Remove manually /build directory because it contains maybe data of an iPad app</h4>
   <h4>Do Clean & Build</h4>
   <h4>Run Distribution as usual.</h4>
   
   The problem is, that after changing settings in tiapp.xml the /build directory seems not to be cleaned. I would claim this as a bug but it's up to you.
