<h3>Description</h3>

Noticed problems commenting out and reverting lines of text in the editor after the update that included highlighting of lines without semi-colons.
It seems to only affect some files but there are no warnings on the pages so I do not know what to look for, nor what I might include in this report to help you view the issue.

If there is a log that I can generate that will illustrate the action of this inaction I will be happy to attach. Please advise.

   Hi Keylo - Please can you describe the issue and its behavior in more detail (expected + actual)? So what actually happens, what does "highlighting of lines without semi-colons" mean? Would a screenshot help?
   
   Thanks!</li>

   I apologize for the delayed response.
   
   Expected - select a line of code, hold command + /, the line of code is commented out.
   before = var myVar = 0;
   after = // var myVar = 0;
   
   Actual - nothing happens.
   
   
   There are no errors or warnings on the page.</li>
