<h3>Description</h3>

Building custom iOS modules in this environment fails are the armv6 arch is not supported by xcode 4.5

So a ./build.py gives

Build settings from command line:
    SDKROOT = iphoneos6.0

=== BUILD NATIVE TARGET testflightti OF PROJECT testflightti WITH CONFIGURATION Release ===
Check dependencies
warning: no rule to process file '$(PROJECT_DIR)/Classes/Module.m' of type sourcecode.c.objc for architecture armv6
warning: no rule to process file '$(PROJECT_DIR)/Classes/ModuleAssets.m' of type sourcecode.c.objc for architecture armv6


** BUILD SUCCEEDED **

The build succeeded is wrong.

The simulator build succeeds and so works on simulator, but error only evident when tested on a device.

The main issue I suppose is that there is a build succeeded message. New projects seem to be okay.

   The new Xcode does not support armv6 and Titanium has removed it as well.</li>
