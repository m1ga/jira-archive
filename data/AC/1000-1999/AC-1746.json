I also noticed that the ACS USER ID is different upon sequential logins. It is still acting as if the initial login is NEVER getting persisted to ACS and therefore generating new ids on each attempt, however it still gives the \"Email is already taken\" error. I am at the end of the rope on this one. I was hoping to use ACS for my user profiles and migrate away from my own DB. I just need to know if its something I'm doing on my end or a problem with ACS. If it has to do with some facebook settings that is a deal breaker as well because I cant assume to know my users FB settings.\n\nI would appreciate ANY direction you could give. Thanks!",
