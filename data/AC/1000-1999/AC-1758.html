<h3>Description</h3>

The auto complete for Ti. stopped working suddenly. I used the 2.x Version at the beginning when I started learning about Titanium.
After the switch to the Preview of Studio 3 the auto complete for "Ti." stopped working.
The weird thing is that auto complete for JS Core, SQL JS, Properties.js and the like are working.

I tried basic solutions like Project -> Clean.. and I also went to content assist and switched the project nature to Alloy (Beta).
The only weird thing I noticed was that going to the global content assist setting revealed that the project nature is stuck at Appcelerator Node.ACS Service no matter what I set it to.
After I hit apply and Ok, close the menu and open it back up the project nature is back at Node.ACS.
