<h3>Description</h3>

I am working on an Android module in Titanium Studio which uses a third party jar library. When I build the project using the build.xml file with install target, first it gives the warning:

<code><pre>warning: Ignoring InnerClasses attribute for an anonymous inner class</pre></code>

and then it gives a build failed error:

<code><pre>[exec] [ERROR] (com.aspire.vending.c.c) that doesn't come with an
[exec] [ERROR] associated EnclosingMethod attribute. This class was probably produced by a
[exec] [ERROR] compiler that did not target the modern .class file format. The recommended
[exec] [ERROR] solution is to recompile the class from source, using an up-to-date compiler
[exec] [ERROR] and without specifying any "-target" type options. The consequence of ignoring
[exec] [ERROR] this warning is that reflective operations on this class will incorrectly
[exec] [ERROR] indicate that it is *not* an inner class.
[exec] [ERROR] System Error while compiling Android classes.dex
[exec] [ERROR] Build Failed.</pre></code>

Note: When I use this library in eclipse in an Android sample example application it works fine.

I put the jar file in lib folder and set the build path from the project properties "java build path setting -> add jars" option.

I also tried just referring the path of the file on my disk drive using "java build path setting -> add Add External jars" option but it is gives the same error.

   Hi Noor,
   
   It would be great if you could create a simple reproducible test case for this (adding the library to a new empty Android module), or at least some steps to reproduce, along with which third party library you're using.
   
   Thanks!</li>
