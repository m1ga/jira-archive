<h3>Description</h3>

The problem I'm facing with is that code completion doesn't work in javascript files. For example when I start typing Ti.UI... nothing is suggested, the popup isn't shown at all. This happens to native javascript properties as well as titanium/alloy related ones.

I opened this topic as I thought there was a problem with my titanium studio configuration, but couldn't get any answer. Other people also experience the same problem as it turned out: <a href="http://developer.appcelerator.com/question/160910/code-completion-doesnt-work-in-titanium-studio" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://developer.appcelerator.com/question/160910/code-completion-doesnt-work-in-titanium-studio</a>

If there is any additional information necessary I'm ready to provide.

   This is a duplicate of TISTUD-5989 and will be addressed in the 3.2.1 release. You could update to the RC stream for that version using the update site specified in <a href="http://preview.appcelerator.com/studio." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://preview.appcelerator.com/studio.</a>

   I think my issue is somewhat different from what is described in that bug report. In my case code completion doesn't work at all. I don't see any popup boxes containing suggestions as I type something. It's just as if I'm typing in notepad or something like that. I'm on 3.2.2.201401081746 right now which is the most recent version.</li>

   Have you tried to run Project > Clean and then see if code completion works?
   
   Thanks.

   Yes, I have tried running Project > Clean but it didn't help.</li>

   Reopening this issue as it appears to be different from TISTUD-5989 based on reporter's latest comment.</li>

   If you right-click on the project and select Properties > Project Build Path, which entry do you see selected? If it is not Titanium Mobile 3.2.0.GA, try selecting it to see if it helps; even if 3.2.0.GA is selected, try switching to a different entry and then select back.
