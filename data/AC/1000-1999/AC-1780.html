   Christopher, the problem you are having is with an alloy project correct? Will other projects (that aren't alloy) build for you, such as pure JS projects? Can you try this and let me know? Or will nothing build for you? Any other information and what you have tried will be very useful to help us get to the bottom of this. Thanks.</li>

   I found out what I was doing wrong so you can close this ticket.
   
   Issue was the project wasn't selected App Explorer tab. I'm thinking that means the project wasn't loaded.  If that's the case then it is misleading that the project in the Project Explorer tab had the project and files open so I thought the project was loaded.</li>
