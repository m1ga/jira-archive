<h3>Description</h3>

Cloud.Reviews.query returns objects that do not match the query.
This is breaking production apps such as Fashionist: <a href="http://bit.ly/1cwEWHK" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/1cwEWHK</a>
I'm using a rating of 1 to differentiate between likes and comments.
Querying for reviews where rating is not 1 used to work. No code change (app has been out on itunes for awhile). Now random reviews seem to be returned including reviews with a rating of 1.
It's been reported on the Q&A board that a similar bug with Events Query just popped up this afternoon also.
Can ACS be rolled back to the previous version from earlier today until this issue is resolved?
