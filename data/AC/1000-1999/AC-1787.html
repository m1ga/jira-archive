<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Steps to Reproduce</h4>
tiapp.xml uses-sdk for android is set to: min=11; target=11; max=19.

I have ALL Android SDKs installed.

Running the application on ANY of the Android simulators results in the error: 'Application Installer abnormal process termination. Process exit value was 8.' Sometimes the process exit value is 1, but mostly 8. I do not know what the exit values refer to, nor could I find any documenation to explain this error message.

<h4>Actual Result</h4>
error message detailed in previous step

<h4>Expected Result</h4>
Android app actually gets built!

   Can you attach the output of the Android build process? I currently see the Studio log attached, but I need to see what the build is outputting. Please set the detail level to [TRACE] when doing so.</li>

   Please let us know if this issue persists for you and we would be happy to investigate it further.</li>

   [~demetri.ganoff@hdsupply.com] It may be a duplicate of TIMOB-16169 based on the process exit code but hard to tell in the absence of build log. We would appreciate if you can provide the build log so that we can confirm the same.</li>

   As far as I can recall, the Titanium CLI never exits with a code 8. It's either 1 or 0. I'm not sure where the exit code 8 is coming from. If you run the build from the CLI with --log-level=trace, it may output a less confusing error.</li>

   Resolving this ticket as the requested information has not been provided for over two weeks. We would be happy to reopen and revisit this issue when you provide the information.</li>
