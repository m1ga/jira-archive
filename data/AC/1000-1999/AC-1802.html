<h3>Description</h3>

According to the doc the property Titanium.userAgent is not readonly and there is even a Titanium.setUserAgent().
It just does not work and, frankly, reading the code at iphone/Classes/TopTiModule.m:40, one hardly knows how it could be anything else. I haven't been able to find the setUserAgent() method in source, not familiar enough with it.

I know that I can override the useragent with a setRequestHeader in HttpClient but I would like also to use it for auto downloads of images throught URLs.

   Hello, just got notified that this one was fixed which is great.
   Any idea in which release it will actually be delivered. I see no commit message or such.
   Thanks for your help
