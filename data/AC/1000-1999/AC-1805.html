<h3>Description</h3>

I am using a table view, row consisting of different images and labels and few buttons.
Scrolling works fine on ipad and iphone, but issue is with android.

   This is a known issue, and the linked JIRA has been escalated further. I'm not closing at duplicate, but as "Needs more info", there's a chance this could be re-opened if this issue is filled in as we expect - like a test case.</li>
