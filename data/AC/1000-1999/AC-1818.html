<h3>Description</h3>

In certain ACS cloud applications, the password reset function fails to work.  We can create a new environment, configure it with identical SMTP settings, use the same codebase, and it works.  

In all cases, when we call the password reset APIs, either through titanium library or through the REST API, we get a 200 success response.  In cloud A, we receive an email to do the reset, in cloud B, we do not.  The same behavior is observed with simply clicking the ACS Cloud GUI button.  

I've seen similar complaints in the forums without resolution - <a href="https://developer.appcelerator.com/question/157895/password-resetting-and-email" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://developer.appcelerator.com/question/157895/password-resetting-and-email</a>

We've got a serious user base on this now so we can't just move clouds over.  Thanks

   Hello Mike,
   
   can you please share your app id with me in private? You may send a mail to mpmiranda@appcelerator.com with that info (for the cases of your app can't do the reset of the password - you can get the app id from the ACS console). So we can do further investigation on this. 
   
   Thanks in advance for your feedback!
   
   Best,
   Mauro </li>

   Hi Mike,
   
   can you try to test email sending first? The q&a link shows all the issues have been resolved. if it works in one app, it should work in another app.

   [~mpinch] We have not been able to reproduce this issue. We would appreciate if you can send me the App key and the email address for which you are having this issue so that we can investigate it on the server side.
   
   We would be happy to reopen and take another look at this issue as soon as we receive the requested information.</li>
