		"description": "In certain ACS cloud applications, the password reset function fails to work.  We can create a new environment, configure it with identical SMTP settings, use the same codebase, and it works.  \r\n\r\nIn all cases, when we call the password reset APIs, either through titanium library or through the REST API, we get a 200 success response.  In cloud A, we receive an email to do the reset, in cloud B, we do not.  The same behavior is observed with simply clicking the ACS Cloud GUI button.  \r\n\r\nI've seen similar complaints in the forums without resolution - https://developer.appcelerator.com/question/157895/password-resetting-and-email\r\n\r\nWe've got a serious user base on this now so we can't just move clouds over.

So we can do further investigation on this. \n\nThanks in advance for your feedback!\n\nBest,\nMauro ",
