   Hello 
   
   Please visit following link for more details. [An application restart is required | <a href="https://developer.appcelerator.com/question/129411/android--an-application-restart-is-required---app-in-market" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://developer.appcelerator.com/question/129411/android--an-application-restart-is-required---app-in-market</a>]
   
   I hope its help you.
   
   Thanks </li>

   Thanks that's helpful, but I think we need a better way to work around this than allowing multiple instances of the application. The best way to work around this in my opinion would be to silently close the new instance (and bring the old instance to the front if necessary). If that doesn't work, the next best thing would be to continue opening the new instance, and silently close the old instance. These options would be very useful, since a dialog that requires user interaction screams "bug!" to basically everyone.</li>

   Hello Billy,
   
   that's a android's bug; The workaround bug2373 is for whoever want to use it. 
   
   Best,

   Yes, I fully understand that Mauro. The question is, why isn't but2373.finishfalseroot applied by default? Please reopen for discussion.</li>

   Also, you didn't say which ticket you think this duplicates. Please link duplicate tickets to the tickets they duplicate.</li>
