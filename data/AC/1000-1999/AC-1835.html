<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Steps to Reproduce</h4>
Create the two tab project template (or any other tab bar application) and run with any 3.1.3 version on iOS 7 simulator.

<h4>Actual Result</h4>
The tab bar initially displays 20 px (or whatever the status bar height is) ABOVE the bottom of the screen, and then re-adjusts itself down to the proper bottom of the screen. Worked fine in versions prior to 3.1.3.x and works fine with iOS 6, just not iOS 7.

<h4>Expected Result</h4>
Tab bar should intitially be displayed at the bottom of the screen on iOS 7 and stay there just as it does on iOS 6 and just as it does on Ti SDK versions below 3.1.3

   This should be resolved by this commit on 3_1_X (although I could not reproduce it)
   <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/commit/8c29d433355ac703b15cf07264740565b2e4001f" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/commit/8c29d433355ac703b15cf07264740565b2e4001f</a> (PR 4706)
   
   Please let us know if that is not the case.

   I saw this. Occurs on first launch only. Will attempt to reproduce with fix. </li>

   Verified fail case and then fix. Best approach is to use two apps (since not occurring or as apparent on subsequent launches) one with older SDK and one with the fix.
   
   This is more visible in simulator than on device. Verified fixed with:
   Mac OS 10.8.4
   Xcode 5 GM seed
   CLI: 3.1.2
   Alloy: 1.2.2-cr
   Appcelerator Studio, build: 3.1.3.201309072408
   Titanium SDK version 3.1.3.v20130917141554
   
   Checked with simulator (iPhone 5 iOS 7) and devices: iPhone 4, iPhone 5, both running iOS 7 GM seed</li>
