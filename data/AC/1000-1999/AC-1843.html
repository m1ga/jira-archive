<h3>Description</h3>

Hi
I am trying out ACS. When I tried to save my SMTP setting, I got an error:
"SMTP Check failed. Hostname was not match with server certificate."
Why is this so and how to resolve it?
Thanks in advance.

   Hi
   
   I disabled port 465 but even if I disabled TLS on ACS, I am still getting the error!
   it seems that although TLS = false, the Appcelerator backend is trying to use TLS as it returns always the error:
   SMTP Check failed hostname was not match with the server certificate.</li>

   Can you send us the details (smtp settings) to find out more? You can either post them or email me at egomez@appcelerator.com
   
   Hope hearing from you soon.</li>

   Hi, I found this is a bug on ACS.
   I was able to setup smtp by setting tls as false, boolean not string.
   ACS tries to save it as string.
   Will push this fix asap.
   
   Thanks.</li>

   This is a duplicate issue that is internally being tracked as ACS bug.</li>
