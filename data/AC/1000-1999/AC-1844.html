<h3>Description</h3>

Hi

We are in the process of delivery, a mobile app has been developed and has now been test accepted by customer, up till now it has been tested on our appcelerator account and so statistics and ACS support has been on our account, now the app must be transfered to their account, how do we do this the easies way? Can you transfer the GUID of the app to a instance at their account. I need this rather asap both because I have to deliver latest tomorrow. Sorry about that...

Any other possiblity of transfering the app? I am thinking about ACS keys also for instance...

Would it be possible to create a new project with their login in Studio, and them import/copy over the code only and build it. Would that transfer it? And what happens then to our instance? Do we need to change app id? I believe there will be a new guid if I create new project . .
