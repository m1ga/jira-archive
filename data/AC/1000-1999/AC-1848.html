<h3>Description</h3>

i am trying to load a remote image from my web server. all works well on the iOS 7 simulator and android but when i run the code of the iOS device the image doesn't load at all. i tested the image url on the browser with no problems at all.

testcase:

var picImage = Ti.UI.createImageView({
            width : 100,
            height : 100,
            borderColor : Constant.borderColor,
            borderWidth : 3,
            left : 10,
            right : 10,
            top : 10,
            bottom : 10
        });
picImage.image ='<a href="http://192.168.13.53:8888/home/home_images/brate_facebook_logo.png" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://192.168.13.53:8888/home/home_images/brate_facebook_logo.png</a>';

   Hello!
   
   Can you please try your own code with another image? Our test shows that the issue could be that your simulator or device didn't have access to that image. Please test that image from your simulator/device'safari to check if you are reaching the server. 
   
   Best,

   i tried the same code with same image but this time i loaded it from my online server (i.e using a domain address); all worked well and the device was able to render the image. but when i use my local ip/server the image doesn't load on device. note that the same test-case works well on the iOS simulator and android device. 
   i still need to test loading the image using the online server via a servlet though </li>

   Hello,
   did you test your image address using safari? 
   
   I mean, the one with the 192...

   yes i did it works well. the image loads normally.
   i also tried to run the same scenario on other network but still have the same problem.</li>

   the problem was from GWT jetty server. the images loads normally when i run the servlet from tomcat...
   thanks</li>
