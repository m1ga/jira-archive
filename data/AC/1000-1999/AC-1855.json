		"description": "If you open maps.apple.com in a WebView to, for example, get directions, you are redirected to maps.google.com.  This would not be so bad except that now maps.google.com is putting up a \"Download our New App\" splash screen and making you skip that to continue to the directions.  Our clients aren't too happy about that.\r\n\r\nI had heard that this was only a problem with the iOS Simulator, but I just tested it on an iOS 6 iPhone and had the redirect to maps.google.com happen.\r\n\r\n{code:javascript}\r\ndirectionsURL = 'http://maps.apple.com/?t=m&saddr=' + myLocation.latitude + ',' + myLocation.longitude + '&daddr=' + dest.lat + ',' + dest.lng;\r\n\r\nTi.UI.createWebView({\r\n    url: directionsURL\r\n});\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nand from the iOS6 simulator log\r\n\r\n{panel}\r\n[DEBUG] New scheme: <NSMutableURLRequest http://maps.apple.com/?t=m&saddr=33.58000183105469,-117.75&daddr=33.5439,-117.7822>\r\n[DEBUG] New scheme: <NSMutableURLRequest http://maps.google.com/?t=m&saddr=33.58000183105469,-117.75&daddr=33.5439,-117.7822>\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nBTW, using\r\n\r\nTi.Platform.openURL(directionsURL);\r\n\r\nworks but leaves your application to invoke the Apple Maps app which our clients also do not like because folks then have to go through an awkward process to return to our app.  \r\n\r\nAnd I know from speaking with Apple App Review team that they also don't like apps which force you to leave the app to do things like get directions.",
