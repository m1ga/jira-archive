   Hello,
   
   I am now able to get compile time down to 1 minute by
   
   1. Removing local simulator: rm -rf  ~/Library/Application\ Support/iPhone\ Simulator/
   2. Clean Project
   3. Build from Titanium
   
   Still takes around 5 minutes for one compile cycle</li>

   Hello,
   
   My machine sometimes takes a few minutes to complete a compilation, depending on the project and the resources used at the time. However, it usually goes quickly if I run it a second time. Does it happen always, and with any project?
   
   Thank you</li>

   Davide - thanks for your response. 
   
   I am in Australia, hence the timezone differences.
   
   I've created a blank iphone project, then attempted to compile and run. The compile took around 1 minute, then the simulator timed out and would not start. I can send you a trace for this if you like.
   
   I've worked out that if I start the simulator through xcode, clear all settings, then go back to titanium studio, build the project, then compile, the app will start on the simulator. The compile and build takes in between 1-3 minutes. If I skip a step the simulator times out.

   Hello,
   
   What happens if you run the blank project again? As mentioned, I sometimes have a similar issue the first time the build is performed, depending on how busy my machine is. When it happens, and the Simulator goes in timeout, I simply run it again and works perfectly. Isn't it your case?
   
   You can send the log, thank you.</li>

   Hello,
   
   Would you have a chance to test out with a different version of XCode? We noticed you are using 4.6.1, which is currently not supported yet. I did not see particular problems on my machine, but there might be some combination that gives the error.
   
   For more information, look at the compatibility table here: <a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#</a>!/guide/Titanium_Compatibility_Matrix-section-29004837_TitaniumCompatibilityMatrix-Xcode
   
   Thank you</li>

   Hi,
   
   We have not heard back from you since March of this year. Not sure if this is still throwing error in your app. There has been several release of our SDK and Since. We recommend you try to install the latest version of the SDK & Studio to test again. If you continue to get the error, please send us details so that we can take next necessary step to fix. If we don't hear back, we will assume the issue is no longer valid and close it. </li>
