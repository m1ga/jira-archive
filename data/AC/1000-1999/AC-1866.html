<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Steps to Reproduce</h4>
The problems seem to be related.
When I try to import a guthub project, my credentials are not accepted. Even though it works on Github.com.    See attached studio log and you see that it says 'Failed to load Github user credentials' -> No Password provided. But I have provided a password.

Further up it says the same thing about the password when I try to login Titanium Studio. -> No password.   But how could I submit this ticket, if I was not logged in in first place?   Hence it doesn't save the password for next time.

I have already given priviledge to the Titanium folder
sudo chown hooman:hooman -R /opt/Titanium_Studio/

without luck.

<h4>Actual Result</h4>
Doesn't save passowords, can't save passwords for TI and for Github

<h4>Expected Result</h4>
Save passwords for github and able to login Github

   Also I took a look at your diagnostic and I found a possible area of concern. You are using JRE 1.7 when only JRE 1.6 is supported at this time. I would advise referring to the the compatability matrix to ensure that all of your dependencies are installed correctly (<a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/3.0/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/3.0/#</a>!/guide/Titanium_Compatibility_Matrix). Also please try reinstalling Titanium Studio and please let me know of your results when you try both of these things. 
   
   Thanks,
