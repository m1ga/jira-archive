<h3>Description</h3>

while trying to hit the url from the mobile web code, it throws CROS issue even after using the Ti.Network.httpURLFormatter.

I have gone through some discussions on this issue, all says use Ti.Network.httpURLFormatter and set the response in web service. there is no clear documentation on this. where to set the response and how it should formatted using Ti.Network.httpURLFormatter.

In my case I am using RESTful web service, here I couldn't find the way to set the response.

If any one could provide clear idea/document/ sample code that would greatly helpful.

Thanks in Advance.
