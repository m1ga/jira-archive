<h3>Description</h3>

After update alloy to the latest version (1.2.0-alpha6), the app got stuck on splash screen. I opened the project through Xcode and when I tried to run the app the debugger says: "error: failed to attach to process ID <Random Number>".

   Hi Julio,
   
   Please state the Ti SDK version you're building with, and attach your Studio diagnostic (Help -> Studio -> Run Diagnostic Test...) (JIRA -> Edit -> Attachments)
   
   Also please define "the app" - is that an existing app? Can you try creating a brand new Alloy app and let me know if it works?
   
   Thanks.</li>

   Hi,
   I'm sorry the lack of info. Well, I'm not using Titanium Studio, but Titanium Cli, SDK 3.1.1. 
   "the app" is an application that I'm creating for my company, Datagenno. I just created a brand new alloy app and it works...

   Julio, this is still far from enough information to help. Are you saying that your app works on iOS 6.X, but not 5.1? If this is the case it seems extraordinarily unlikely that Alloy is the culprit here. Does your app work with any other versions of Alloy? I'm wondering if perhaps you changed something else besides just the alloy version. Have you updated the TiSDK?</li>
