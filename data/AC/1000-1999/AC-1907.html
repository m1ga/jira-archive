<h3>Description</h3>

[ERROR] Missing required option "--username"

d:\Documents and Settings\collinda\Application Data\npm\node_modules\titanium\node_modules\node-appc\lib\analytics.js:180
				sessionCookie = status.cookie.match(/(PHPSESSID=[A-Za-z0-9]+)/),
				                              ^
I have looked at various articles on this and some say to login
but Studio already says 'Hello, David', etc.

Very frustrating.

In an office with proxies, etc. but all this seems to be OK because I have been able to download updates, etc.

The log file is showing these errors at startup ..

   Hello David, though we do not support Titanium on Windows 2008 Server, I have done a small bit of research behind the issue and it seems you are not the first to experience this: <a href="http://developer.appcelerator.com/question/146861/titanium-studion---create-new-project-error-error-missing-required-option---username" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://developer.appcelerator.com/question/146861/titanium-studion---create-new-project-error-error-missing-required-option---username</a>
   From this it seems to me like the problem is indeed the proxy. Have you set it properly? Here is more information in case you have not seen this thread: <a href="http://developer.appcelerator.com/question/146837/unable-to-login-with-titanium-cli-version-3022" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://developer.appcelerator.com/question/146837/unable-to-login-with-titanium-cli-version-3022</a>
   Unfortunately my ability to help further is limited since we do not support Windows 2008 Server, due to this I must resolve the issue. Are you able to replicate this issue on a Windows 7 machine?
   Regards,

   Thanks, Carter for the information.
   
   I am in an office where most of the PCs including my own are still on Windows XP.
   I am now using the Google Android Development Tools (ADT) because I could get that installed and working in less than a day, and the tutorials are quite helpful.
   I really like Aptana Studio and thought that Titanium would also be good.  Pity that I couldn't get Titanium Studio working.
   
   Regards,
   David
   
   By the way, I applied for paid Titanium support, but never got a reply.

   Hello David,
   
   I have looked into your issue some more and would like to try and help you if you are still interested in developing with Titanium. Some customers have got Titanium to work with XP and Windows Server and I wanted to try a few more things to see if we can get it working for you. First, please check out this site:
   
   (<a href="https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/devsup/Using+Titanium+Behind+a+Proxy)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/devsup/Using+Titanium+Behind+a+Proxy)</a> it says:
   
   "You need to add the following ports to the firewall's white list
   <a href="https://api.appcelerator.net" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://api.appcelerator.net</a> (ports 80 and 443) Used for login
   
   <a href="http://studio.appcelerator.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://studio.appcelerator.com</a> (ports 80 and 443) Used for the dashboard
   
   <a href="http://download.appcelerator.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://download.appcelerator.com</a> (ports 80 and 443) Used for software updates"
   
   add these ports to your firewall's whitelist and see if that solves your problem. If Studio isn't working for you, we might be able to get signed in via CLI. Try this in CLI:
   
   Run <code>titanium status</code> paste the output.
   
   If the output does NOT include 'You are currently logged in as xxxxxs@xxxxxx.xxx' then run 'titanium login'
   
   and let me know if you can get anywhere.
   Hope this solves your issue.
   
   Have a good one,
   Carter</li>
