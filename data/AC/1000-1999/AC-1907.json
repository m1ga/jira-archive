Have you set it properly? Here is more information in case you have not seen this thread: http://developer.appcelerator.com/question/146837/unable-to-login-with-titanium-cli-version-3022\nUnfortunately my ability to help further is limited since we do not support Windows 2008 Server, due to this I must resolve the issue. Are you able to replicate this issue on a Windows 7 machine?\nRegards,\nCarter",

					"body": "Hello David,\n\nI have looked into your issue some more and would like to try and help you if you are still interested in developing with Titanium. Some customers have got Titanium to work with XP and Windows Server and I wanted to try a few more things to see if we can get it working for you. First, please check out this site:\n\n(https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/devsup/Using+Titanium+Behind+a+Proxy) it says:\n\n\"You need to add the following ports to the firewall's white list\nhttps://api.appcelerator.net (ports 80 and 443) Used for login\n\nhttp://studio.appcelerator.com (ports 80 and 443) Used for the dashboard\n\nhttp://download.appcelerator.com (ports 80 and 443) Used for software updates\"\n\nadd these ports to your firewall's whitelist and see if that solves your problem. If Studio isn't working for you, we might be able to get signed in via CLI. Try this in CLI:\n\nRun `titanium status` paste the output.\n\nIf the output does NOT include 'You are currently logged in as xxxxxs@xxxxxx.xxx' then run 'titanium login'\n\nand let me know if you can get anywhere.\nHope this solves your issue.\n\nHave a good one,\nCarter",
