   Ignore this one. It was due to a module I used.</li>

   Marking it resolved as Invalid as per updated info from Wienke.</li>

   @Wienke could you elaborate which plugin was causing the problem? We are experiencing the exact same issue but have no webview-related plugins and the site works on Mobile Safari and also from the Android WebView.</li>

   @milgner not sure, which one it was. But it was a module we wrote our own that did a overwrite on the UIWebView class. Can you elaborate a bit more on the matter?</li>

   Thanks for getting back to me! In the meantime I found that we did indeed have a special module running on iOS that influences webview behaviour: NappUI. I have been able to trace the problem and build a custom version that works. There's also a ticket in which I describe the problem: <a href="https://github.com/viezel/NappUI/issues/57" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/viezel/NappUI/issues/57</a> </li>
<li>Wienke 2015-04-23

   As you mention it, this was indeed the module that gave the problem for us as well. 
   
   What we did is remove the TiUIWebView+Extend.m and TiUIWebView+Extend.h files because we did not need them. They provide the extended functionality for the web view.</li>

   Unfortunately we only pulled in this module to set a custom user agent on iOS, so we can't remove it completely. But I traced the problem back to a specific commit (custom headers) and after revoking that one everything works as expected.
   
   So thanks again for the quick feedback, I much appreciate it. As I mentioned in the ticket on Github, I'm not really familiar with native iOS development so it's a lot of shooting into the dark for problems like this. ^^
   
   All the best
