<h3>Description</h3>

In the screenshot, you can see the Build Error I am getting when I try to run in the Android Emulator.

You can see the emulator settings in the screenshot.  When I run this avd from the command line, the emulator loads.  One time, after the emulator was running from the command line, I tried launching from TS and it loaded the test app, but it only happened once and hasn't happened again.

You can see my Android SDK path and installed items in the screenshot.  Also installed (not visible in the screenshot) are the Google Web Driver and Intel x86 Emulator Accelerator (HAXM).

Any help would be appreciated.  I have spent over 5 hours trying to get this to work so far and all I'm trying to do is load the test app.

Thanks,
Neville

   Hi Neville,
   
   Please try this with the latest studio (3.0.2) and let me know if you still have the problem. Also be sure to clean the project (Project -> Clean...) before building. You can also check the Run Configurations to see which emulator you're running.
   
   Thanks!</li>
