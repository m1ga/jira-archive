<h3>Description</h3>

This is a fresh install of Ti Studio 3.2.1.201401201800 (not sure if that means "2014 Sprint 01") on a new OSX 10.9 machine. Immediately after installation everything looked fine, I was able to use Ti Studio normally. After a restart, Ti Studio now gets stuck on the Titanium Updates dialog, see attachment. The only active button is "Install", but nothing happens when I click it.

The 3.2.0 version of the SDK that the dialog is complaining about is actually installed. I tried to remove it -- it didn't make any difference. I tried to turn off automatic updates in Preferences -- it didn't make any difference.

Needless to say this bug makes Ti Studio completely unusable. I can't access the main window because the dialog is "on top of it", and I can't get rid of the dialog.

   Hi Ritu,
   
   I can't access the Help menu, or any part of the Ti Studio GUI apart from the "Titanium Updates" dialog and the "Titanium Studio" menu (the one on the left, that has the "About" and "Preferences" menu items in it), because that dialog sits on top of everything else.</li>

   Could you please attach the output of the following commands to diagnose the issue further.
   1. Ti info
   2. Ti sdk
   3. Ti config</li>

   Hi Ritu,
   
   I attached the requested info in titanium-logs.txt. Please note that I have been using this machine for Titanium development despite the troubles with Ti Studio (using Titanium CLI and other text editors) so the config is slightly different than when I installed Ti Studio. For example I moved the Titanium installation from my home directory to the root. I believe have tried to start Ti Studio with this config and I ran into this same problem. However I now tried again and this time the installation of Ti SDK 3.2.0 actually went through when I clicked the Install button and now it seems that I can use Ti Studio...
   
   Thanks,
   Zsombor</li>

   Thanks for providing the requested information. Does your most recent comment mean that you no longer have this issue?</li>

   We have not been able to reproduce this issue and the reporter cannot reproduce it anymore.</li>
