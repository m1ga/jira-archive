   Hi Mads,
   
   I can't reproduce this unfortunately. I tried both with one of my test projects, and creating a brand new Classic Default Project, both show my custom splash screens fine with fullscreen set to true in tiapp.xml. Tested on iOS 6 simulator with Ti SDK 3.1.0 GA and 3.1.1 GA. Does this only occur on a device by any chance?</li>

   hmm.. I had this issue all day, and when I finally changed it into fullscreen false, then I got my custom splash screen back.
   But now I cannot reproduce either. Im sorry. I might be mental. Ill reopen the issue, if I find the reproducible solution. </li>

   Hi Daniel,
   
   I can say, it has nothing to do with fullscreen but it happens :S
   I was just about to publish an app to the App Store, so I did a distribution build.
   
   *This is my iPhone folder in my Resources:*
   !<a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2132088/app-iphone-folder.png" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2132088/app-iphone-folder.png</a>! 
   
   *This is my distribution IPA payload content:*
   !<a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2132088/app-dist.png" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2132088/app-dist.png</a>! 
   
   As you see, the default appcelerator images occurs in the final build :S
   
   Im not sure of the pattern to reproduce it, but it happens. </li>

   Hmm that doesn't sound good. It shouldn't happen at all, so maybe the build scripts are messing up somewhere.
   
   So this sometimes happens in your development build?
   
   Does it always happen in your distribution build?
   
   As a workaround for now so that you can actually submit the app, you can replace the contents at:
   
   <code><pre>/Users/[username]/Library/Application Support/Titanium/mobilesdk/osx/3.1.1.GA/iphone/Resources</pre></code></li>

   Hi Daniel,
   
   haha, I hate when stuff is not clear and easy to reproduce. 
   Yes, it happen both in development and distribution. Not each time, but often. (yes i know. It does not make sense).
   
   I cannot figure out what is triguring the compiler to use those standard images.. </li>
