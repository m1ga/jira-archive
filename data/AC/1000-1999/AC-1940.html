<h3>Description</h3>

Load up the latest Kitchen Sink:

Select Controls Tab
Select Action Bar from list
Select SHOW_AS_ACTION_IF_ROOM OR SHOW_AS_ACTION_IF_NEVER
Then Toggle the Menu Item hardware or software button. 

You will see an overflow of the text related to the Menu Items.

The Action Jackson alloy project does not suffer form this issue, but they have included a custom action bar theme, which most probably fixes the issue. I am not the only one seeing this problem.

   Any updates to this? Its a major issue with developing any Android > 3.x app if we are using the action bar. 
   
   It's a MAJOR issue.

   [~stereoket] Google does not encourage developers to set anyDensity to false. <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/supports-screens-element.html#any." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/supports-screens-element.html#any.</a> Is there a reason you need that setting?</li>

   As per Ingo's: Google does not encourage developers to set anyDensity to false. <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/supports-screens-element.html#any." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/supports-screens-element.html#any.</a> Is there a reason you need that setting?

   They may not encourage it, but they are talking from an android only perspective. There are many use cases where this setting fixes cross platform and density issues, also a lot of devs may have this set.
   
   Setting it to true will impact the app based upon the units used.
   
   It is a bug nevertheless and should not cause an off screen rendering when using menu items.
   
   So i don't think this ticket should be closed.</li>

   [~stereoket] Could you expand on your comment about impact based on the units being used?
   
   In 3.2.0, we are trying to update the defaults for tiapp.xml, including the default units for projects (see TIMOB-14620). We am faced with a limited amount of time to work on bugs, and so I would prefer to fix bugs by encouraging supported best practices, rather than something which is discouraged by Google, and causes a number of ancillary side effects.
   
   Thoughts appreciated.</li>
