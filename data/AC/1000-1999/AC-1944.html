<h3>Description</h3>

In studio or from CLI, if I run my app on the iOS simulator 6.0, I get the expected console output from Ti.API.warn.  If I run my app on the iOS simulator 7.0.3, I get no console output after the app loads.  I see the normal console output from the build process, but once the app is launched in simulator, output ceases, and my Ti.API.warns never appear.

I know this was an issue with 3.1.3, and I thought it was fixed in 3.2.0, but it is happening to me in 3.2.1 now.

To test, all you need is an app.js that does nothing more than a Ti.API.warn('test'); and see if the output appears on the console.

I can limp by using my 6.0 simulator for now, but this is an issue I need to get solved.  Thanks!

   My output is identical to yours, except my output ends at:
   [INFO]  Focusing the iOS Simualtor
   
   I never get "Application started" or "AppName/V (3.1.1.GA.xxx)" or my Ti.API.warn output...  Any ideas what I should look at?  I don't doubt it's a problem on my end, just don't know how to diagnose and fix...</li>

   More new info - after creating a new project and playing around, I've narrowed it down to when I run the original size emulator (the basic iphone, no retina, no tall, no 64 bit).  The retina emulators produce the console output as expected.</li>
