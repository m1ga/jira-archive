<h3>Description</h3>

I have a WebView with a graph in it (Flot charts). Upon fetching graph data from internet, I do a Ti.App.fireEvent to the event listener inside the WebView context. I am still testing it (due to some irregular behaviour) and now got a full app crash. Attached are crash reports. The relevant piece of code is below:
<code><pre>
Ti.App.fireEvent("renderChart", {
	chartData: chartData,
	options: options
});
</pre></code>
chartData is an array of [Date, Number] elements. Options is a hash of Flot options. It includes other hashes, scalar variables and one function (which I know will be serialized away). I can provide an example of these values if needed.

Normally this works correctly, but this time I was quickly switching between multiple screens and it crashed.

   Managed to crash it the second time with exact same crash report at the same point.</li>

   Hello,
   
   If you can provide a full example, that would be great. I don't have any experience of crashes normally, so that would definitely help to isolate the issue.
   
   Thank you

   Hi, Davide,
   
   In what form would you like to have an example? I can provide a packaged app and relevant code snippets, if needed, but I don't think I'd be able to provide full app source code (app is being launched for a first customer).
   
   Andrey.</li>

   Hello,
   
   If you can create a sample code (2-3 files) that reproduces the issue, that would be perfect.</li>

   Hi,
   
   At this moment I cannot provide a reproducible testcase. However, here are the steps to reproduce it on your iPad:
   
   1. Go to <a href="http://tinyurl.com/btzjoku" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://tinyurl.com/btzjoku</a> (redirects to iTunes, as I don't want direct links with customer name in bug report).
   2. Download the first (and currently the only) app.
   3. Reproduce the error within a minute by doing the following:
   a) open the menu (top-right button);
   b) choose any menu item;
   c) open the menu;
   d) choose the item "Share price";
   e) tap quickly on the graph that appears on the page;
   f) repeat.
   
   I managed to reproduce it within half a minute. Let me know if you need more info.</li>

   Needs a small reproducible test case.</li>

   Closing since we can't reproduce the issue and Andrey has not provided us runnable test code.</li>
