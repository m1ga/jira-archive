   Hello Brian,
   
   Apologies for this issue. Can you provide me with some more information about your problem here? What version of node.acs do you have currently if at all? Also, just to clarify, you are on Mac OSX platform correct? Also would you mind trying to uninstall and reinstall titanium? Sometimes paths to libraries get incorrectly associated and can prevent updates. Be sure to install everything in the default locations. Try this method and let me know of your results.
   
   Thanks for your patience,
   Carter</li>

   Hi Carter,
   
   To answer in order:
   
   To my knowledge Node.ACS never installed .. had errors from the start.  But I had been trying to verify this in the Ti Studio .. however, I can't find this info.   :-S
   
   Yes this problem is on Mac 10.7.5
   
   I dont mind trying to uninstall/reinstall Titanium .. only if it will not affect my current Titanium configuration in any way.  For me uninstalling/reinstalling has always been a last step, not a first one .. Since it always entails much more work than its worth .. always seems easier to just fix it.
   
   
   Anyway .. hope this helps
   
   Thx
   
   -Brian
