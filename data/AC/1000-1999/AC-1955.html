<h3>Description</h3>

The swipe gesture doesnt't work if the window contains a ScrollView, actually it works but only on the label inside the ScrollView

Code to reproduce

var win = Ti.UI.createWindow({
	backgroundColor : 'white'
});
var scrollView = Ti.UI.createScrollView({
	layout : 'vertical',
	contentHeight : 'auto',
	top : 0,
	bottom : 0
});
var label = Ti.UI.createLabel({
	text : 'Swipe only works on this label',
	font : {
		fontSize : 48
	},
	top : 0
});

scrollView.add(label);
win.add(scrollView);

win.addEventListener('swipe', function(e) {
	alert('swipe');
});

win.open();

   HiDavid Benko,

   Thanks

   @Motiur, I tested on the following devices and it doesnt work: Samsung Galaxy S2 Android 4.1.2, Galaxy S4 4.2.2, Nexus 4 Android 4.2.2 
   But strangely I have tested on a Galaxy Note 10.1 Android 4.1.2 and the gesture worked without being on the label
   Maybe you should try to reproduce on one of the devices I mentioned</li>

   Reopening this ticket as I can reproduce it on Samsung Galaxy Nexus device with 4.2.2. However, this appears to be a duplicate of TIMOB-13698 that has been resolved as "Won't Fix". Please try the work around suggested in that ticket and let us know if it resolves the problem. </li>

   Though this may be related to TIMOB-13698, it's a very different request. Gesture events should still work on the ScrollView, but not even a pinch event gets fired. This severely limits the ability to create applications that are heavily based on gestures for navigation (like Facebook's Pages app).</li>

   Hello,
   
   Swipe (horizontal) is working well on a ScrollView. But pinch event is not getting fired. 
   I tested this issue in two Non brand Android Device with 4.0.4 ,4.2.2 SDK  and SDK 3.2.1 GA, Titanium Studio, build: 3.2.1.201402041146 
   
   
   Thanks</li>

   Pinch event is marked as iOS only so it is expected not to fire on Android platform.

   [~matthewcongrove] This may be a valid feature request for Android platform so you may want to file such request directly in TIMOB project.
