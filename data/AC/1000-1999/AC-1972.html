<h3>Description</h3>

cli doesnt handle proxy correctly. Consequently sometimes i just cant do ANYTHING as it will hang at login.
From the last version i am not sure it is not only happening from within TStudio (where you pass user/pwd in the command line)

So what i do is everytime you release a new CLI, i comment everything related to Analytics or auth.

So please add an option. ~/.titanium/config.json to do noAuth
noAuth would mean no login + no statistics

Moreover people should know that everything is sent to Appcelerator!
Personally i dont like that at all especially when it prevent me from working!

   What you're asking for is to basically be able to run Studio while offline. Auth & statistics is part of our infrastructure, so simply allowing users to disable it needs deep consideration - and it's covered in the issue I linked.</li>

   I know what it means for you. But what it means for me is that i often finding myself in a position where i cant work because i have no network or behind a proxy.
   Actually today, no network seems to be find, when not working on the framework itself.
   But behind a proxy i almost always end up with a hanging build, studio.
   
   As for the statistics, there s a lot of them going on, and knowing that my app, workspace will constantly send you data might SCARE clients. That's why i have to disable them just to be sure, as i can't tell really was going through</li>

   A workaround is to login when you have access to a connection and just leave it open, then you'll have 72 hours of offline use.
   
   Apps don't send data when they are build for production btw. Studio does, but that's a developer's concern. The only data apps in development send AFAIK is checking if modules are valid.</li>

   About the 72 hours, what if you have to restart :D I had that problem so many times when at clients

   Untrue, developer's concern is client concern! About what's being sent i hope you are true but as it is not clear, that's why i simply disable everything in my env.</li>
