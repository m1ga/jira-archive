<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Steps to Reproduce</h4>
1. Update Titanium Studio to latest version
2. Click to configure Android SDK (to build apps for)
3. Let configurator run
4. After it says successfully completed, restart Titanium Studio
5. Upon restarting Titanium Studio, still see error messages that Android is not properly setup.

<h4>Actual Result</h4>
Android still not setup (even thought it has been downloaded to proper place)

<h4>Expected Result</h4>
Android setup properly. This has been a HUGE bug in TitaniumStudio for as long as I can remember. I spent countless hours wrestling with error messages that Android SDK is not setup or in the proper location. I hoped that this new auto-configurator would do it but it still DOES NOT WORK. Thanks.

   As you can see I have the Android SDK installed (via TitaniumStudio configurator tool), yet the program STILL cannot find it (see error message). I think it is a bug because I let the configurator run on its own and it still shows cannot be found.</li>

   I think this is a much bigger problem seeing all the forum posts that have been made:

   There are 39,000 results on Google for this. Please make the error checking in the Platform Configuration tool more intelligent.</li>

   What the Platform Configuation tool looks like after its done running.</li>

   This appears to be a known issue described at TISTUD-6007 and TC-3559. What is interesting is that one of your screenshots indicates the SDK was installed in c:\android-sdk-win directory but the second screenshot shows the location as c:\android-sdk-home. 
   
   Studio fails to recognize a valid Android SDK location if the android.sdkPath hook (in 'titanium config') refers to a different path. To work around the problem, you can use the command 'ti config android.sdkPath c:\android-sdk-win' to set the path on CLI, restart Studio and configure the same path in Studio preferences. Please provide us the following information if this work around does not work for you.
   
   1) Output for the command 'titanium sdk'
   2) Output for the command 'titanium config'
   2) Output for the command 'titanium info'</li>
