<h3>Description</h3>

trying to update from the original installed Ti Studio 3.1.2.   Everything got updated eventually (Ti Studio, Ti SDK) except the CLI.   I've tried the suggestions in the link:  <a href="http://developer.appcelerator.com/question/161373/cant-update-cli-to-32#answer-274036." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://developer.appcelerator.com/question/161373/cant-update-cli-to-32#answer-274036.</a>   But no luck yet.

   Thanks for reporting this issue. I am curious if you also tried the steps provided by "wirawit chaochaisit" on the Q&A thread. He posted good suggestion earlier today so it may be helpful.</li>

   Hi Ritu, thx,
   
   Yes, wirawits suggestions seem to work, thx.
   
   However it does break something else now.  Now when doing an iOS build(emulators, adhoc and distribution), I get the following:
   [ERROR] :  Invalid "--ios-version" value "7.0.3"
      7.0
      6.1
   For help, run: titanium help build
   
   When trying to reset to 7.0 .. I dont get that selection in any of the run configurations dialog boxes.
   
   Any thought on this one Ritu?
   
   Many thx again</li>

   Hi again Ritu,
   
   the '--ios-version' error is too resolved. I forgot to change the Ti SDK to 3.2.0 after fixing the CLI.
   
   ;-)
   
   thx
   
   This can be marked as resolved .. unless you wanna issue a fix to ensure that wirawit's step 3:
   
   3) Run 'sudo npm config set prefix /usr/local' which will revert back the npm prefix for bin and lib/node_module (global package install location) to the default.
   
   is enforced on any updates
   
   ;-)
   
   
   Thx again!</li>
