   Hi Akash,
   
   Sorry I don't know what "JMC component", "JMC feedback application" or "a valid JIRA project" is. Please could you provide some links to where I could find and add it? Also make sure that if you had to write any code to reproduce this error that you post it here.
   
   Thanks!</li>

   Hi Daniel,
   
   I have the links for JIRA Mobile Connect(JMC) component and feedback application here: <a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/jiramobileconnect/overview" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.atlassian.com/software/jiramobileconnect/overview</a> and <a href="https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.atlassian.jconnect.jconnect-plugin" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.atlassian.jconnect.jconnect-plugin</a> .
   
   To add it to the project(mobile application), I just followed the instructions on this page. By "JIRA project", I am referring to the project I created to asa server side/logging project for this component.
   
   I did not add any specific code but found it to be SDK behavior.</li>

   Hi Akash,
   
   Please can you explain how this is related to Appcelerator Titanium?
   
   That is, unless there's an Accelerator Marketplace module for the JIRA mobile connect SDK, but I can't see one.</li>
