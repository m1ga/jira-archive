   Hi Pete Rowley,
   
   When you have updated titanium 3.1.3 it needs to update corresponding CLI , alloy, and node. So update this if you want to use latest version. And when release any update version of any component of titanium  it will show updating option.
   
   Thanks  </li>

   Hi Motiur,
   
   I did update - twice. I just tried for a third time and Help/Check for Titanium updates still says I need to update... I watched the process issue the npm commands for the downloads in the progress view - all executed successfully.
   
   Regards

   Hi Pete,
   
   Through some more testing, I was not able to reproduce your issue.
   Could you please verify if you are still seeing this issue? There have been some updates since September.
   Also, have you entered any URLs or websites into the "Available Software Sites" section of your Install/Update preferences?
   
   Thanks and please let me know if you have any questions.
   </li>

   IIRC I resolved this by changing one of the version settings after install - alloy? Not sure.</li>

   Glad to hear it is resolved! I will close this as such.
   Feel free to re-open this if it occurs again.</li>
</ol>
