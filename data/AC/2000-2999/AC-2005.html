<h3>Description</h3>

I am new to Titanium Studio. I downloaded Xcode from apple and it indicated that the iOS SDK is included in that download. However, Titanium Studio is not recognizing it. It shows that the iOS SDK is not installed. When I click on install, the XCode screen on my new MacBookAir comes up and indicates it is installed. Can someone help me as to what I am doing wrong. Do I have to download something else? I am running Lion OS X 10.8.3. Thank you

   Hi Arvind,
   
   For these type of questions, please use the Q&A first, JIRA is for bug reports and feature requests: <a href="http://developer.appcelerator.com/questions/newest" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://developer.appcelerator.com/questions/newest</a>
   
   Anyway, can you go to "Titanium Studio -> Preferences... -> Studio -> Platforms -> iOS" and check that iOS SDK Home points to:
   
   <code><pre>/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/SDKs</pre></code>
   
   If not, please run this in Terminal:
   
   <code><pre>xcode-select --print-path</pre></code>
   
   Check that it points to:
   
   <code><pre>/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer</pre></code>
   
   If not run:
   
   <code><pre>sudo xcode-select -switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer</pre></code></li>
