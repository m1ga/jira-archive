<h3>Description</h3>

I have an app that is (was) ready to be submitted for review/distribution, but held back for IOS 6 compatibility. Everything was tested and rock-solid up until installing all of the software to support IOS 6.

Upon installing Xcode 4.5, SDK 2.1.3 and the latest store kit module (1.6), I am crashing when completing the purchase of a 'Consumable' product. When I click my Purchase button, I get the "Confirm your In-App Purchase dialog box. Upon clicking BUY, I am getting the message "You've already purchased this In-App Purchase but it hasn't been downloaded." When I click the OK button, it always goes down the path where the evt.state returned from Storekit.purchase = Storekit.FAILED.

The "You've already purchased this In-App Purchase but it hasn't been downloaded." dialog box is new, but not sure if this has anything to do with the ultimate Storekit.FAILED.

Naturally, I am testing on a device ...

<code><pre>
function purchaseProduct(product, productID) {
    showLoading();
    Storekit.purchase(product, function (evt) {
        hideLoading();
        switch (evt.state) {
            case Storekit.FAILED:
                alert('ERROR: Buying failed!');
                break;
            case Storekit.PURCHASED:
            case Storekit.RESTORED:
                //alert('Thanks!');
                ProcessTransaction(userid, 1, productID);
                markProductAsPurchased(product.identifier);
                break;
        }
    });
}
</pre></code>

   I seem to have fixed this problem after finding info on another Apple Dev forum. It appears as though deleting and re-creating the "Test User" sometimes fixes this problem, and in my case this took care of it.</li>

   I'm not sure why this problem began right after my software upgrades, but that was when the problem started.</li>

   Thank you for the update. Closing this bug, as it appears to have been solved by adjusting the user account on Apple's side.</li>
