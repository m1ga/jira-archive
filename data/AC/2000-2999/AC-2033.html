   Hi Parul,
   
   Could you please provide more details about the issue? It is not quite clear from the subject line.
   
   Thanks</li>

   If you're talking about [1m[36m that's not a bug. These are color codes. It seems that your shell doesn't support it. Please try titanium --no-colors</li>

   We have not heard back from you since the last post by Dmitriy. Not sure if this is fixed for you as per recommendation from Dmitriy. If the error exists, please send us details so that we can take next necessary step to fix. 
   
   There has been many updates to the SDK and CLI as well studio since March 2013. Please try our latest release and give it a try to find many new features and fixes. If we don't hear back, we will assume the issue is no longer valid and close it. </li>
