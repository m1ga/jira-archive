<h3>Description</h3>

When build a project (command line or using Titanium Studio) there is an error appearing after the apk has been deployed on the Android emulator:

/usr/local/lib/node_modules/titanium/node_modules/longjohn/dist/longjohn.js:184
        throw e;

(see attached stacktrace)

I am using node 0.10.25.

Is there anything that I can check or more info that I require to enter here ?

   It may be related to TIMOB-15804. Can you please review the description and workaround in this ticket to see if solves your problem?</li>

   I checked the other ticket, updated both TI and sdk to version 3.2.1 but the problem still persist.
   
   I tried also to make a copy of node -> nodejs but this did not change the situation.
   
   Is there any info that I can provide to better identify this issue ?</li>

   Reopening this ticket based on latest comment from the reporter.</li>

   [~dawez] I am curious if you also updated Titanium CLI to the latest 3.2.1 version as per the following command:
   
   sudo npm install -g titanium@3.2.1-beta3</li>
<li>Davide 2014-02-04

   Yep I did update to 3.2.1-beta3
   
   $ ti --version
   3.2.1-beta3
   
   The funny thing is that sometimes the debugger is logging is working fine [IE the build process does not crash] but this is happening quite randomly [would say like 10% of the times].
   
   Will also try with another machine this week to see if the problem is due the current setup.

   "ti build --no-prompt --platform android" command builds the project and then installs and runs the application on an already running emulator. Your error log indicates a problem with the running Android emulator. Android emulator is notorious and more so on Linux systems. Can you please try the following command that eliminates Android emulator from the equation?
   
   ti build --platform android --build-only
   
   </li>

   So using "ti build --no-prompt --platform android" reports no error and everything is compiling fine.
   
   I am also able to compile + deploy to a physical android device.
   
   But the emulator sometimes is able to stay connected to the process and this is really puzzling me...
   
   I can see the log, after the emulator crashing using:
   
   adb logcat TiAPI:D *:S
   
   and this is correctly displaying the logging commands in the code: Ti.API.error(), warn, log and so on.
   
   It seems like that something is causing a crash as soon as the application is deployed. 
   
   I still have to try with another machine to see if just a machine specific issue.</li>
<li>Ritu Agrawal 2014-02-17

   Resolving this ticket as we cannot reproduce this issue and you have been able to build the project successfully. ADB and Android emulator can be shaky on Linux environments so you may want to kill and restart adb server. We would be happy to reopen the ticket if you run into the same issue on another machine.</li>
