<h3>Description</h3>

Building iOS ad hoc with latest CI builds no longer works.
Generates an error message
[ERROR] :  Invalid Provisioning Profile UUID 

Switching to TiSDK 3.1.2.GA does work. Same goes for 3.2.0.v20130629xxxx.

I would love to provide a test case but that would require sending private keys.

   The error comes from [that](<a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/blob/master/iphone/cli/commands/_build.js#L633)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/blob/master/iphone/cli/commands/_build.js#L633)</a> line
   It needs to be
   
   <code><pre>
   var m = name.match(/^([^(]+?)*/);
   return (m ? m[0] : name).trim().toLowerCase();
   </pre></code>
   
   Just like it is for development profile</li>

   This issue is not reproducible in our environment. Please provided a details test case and reopen if necessary.</li>

   @Shak: to reproduce it you have to regenerate a certificate and provisioning profile. I saw it when i renewed my apple account.
   Plus please dont just say that it s not reproducible. I actually gave you the exact implementation problem! If you look just a little at it you will clearly see that it s a missing implementation which is already used for the development certificate!
   
   Thanks</li>

   Same problem here see <a href="http://developer.appcelerator.com/question/157606/ios---not-able-to-create-adhoc-distribution" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://developer.appcelerator.com/question/157606/ios---not-able-to-create-adhoc-distribution</a></li>

   Given what Martin had replied, will this ever be re-opened?</li>

   Was not able to reproduce this issue with latest RC stack i.e. was able to build for adhoc.
   
   Tested on:
   
   Titanium Studio, build: 3.2.0.201312081251
   SDK build: 3.2.0.v20131209000852
   Xcode: 5.0.2
   CLI: 3.2.0-beta
   Alloy: 1.3.0-beta
   
   Also, when I pointed my xcode-select to use Xcode 4.5 with my above Titanium setup, I get this error in TiStudio console:
   
   <code><pre>
   [ERROR] :  There are no Xcode installations found that are supported by Titanium SDK 3.2.0.
   </pre></code></li>

   I tried and also could not reproduce. Resolving.</li>
<li>Martin Guillon 2013-12-12

   Chris by looking at the code i agree it is fixed. And that s what i would prefer to hear than "could not reproduce" ;)
   
   I mean i show the line of where the problem was (well i pointed to the master file, so now it points to the one you modified :P) and there was clearly a difference between dev and dist provisioning profile name check. So the bug existed for sure.
   
   For the sake of following bugs correctly it would be better to say that the bug have been fixed. Even if i know that what YOU mean ;)
   
   Thanks for looking at it Chris</li>
