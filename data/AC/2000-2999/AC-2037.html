<h3>Description</h3>

Hi
I am trying out ACS. When I tried to save my SMTP setting, I got an error:
"SMTP Check failed. Hostname was not match with server certificate."
Why is this so and how to resolve it?
Thanks in advance.

   Thanks for submit the report Peter.
   
   From error message looks like the email provider requires a certificate along with regular smtp setting. Can you send us details to find out more? You can post the details or you can email me at egomez@appcelerator.com
   
   Hope hearing from you soon.</li>

   Is there a way for ACS to ignore the certificate?
   This is because it is out of my control.
   I have the same problem setting up email account on iphone but even it complain about the certificate mismatch, the email app on iphone still works.
   
   Thanks!</li>

   This is actually an email provider limitation not us.
   
   I'll leave this open for a while. If you can send us details I'd be happy to reach out Cloud Engineering. Thanks.</li>

   Hi
   
   I disabled port 465 but even if I disabled TLS on ACS, I am still getting the error!
   it seems that although TLS = false, the Appcelerator backend is trying to use TLS as it returns always the error:
   SMTP Check failed hostname was not match with the server certificate.</li>

   Hi Peter,
   
   I tested this issue in web browser using the steps below. Itâ€™s working for me. In my test, I used Google SMTP information. Can you please give us an update whether this is an issue for you? If you can provide some additional information, we will revisit this. For now, we will mark it resolved.
   
    
    
   <h4>Steps to Test</h4>
   <h4>Login in ACS web client (<a href="https://cloud.appcelerator.com/apps/xxxxxxxx)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://cloud.appcelerator.com/apps/xxxxxxxx)</a></h4>
   <h4>Click on setting tab </h4>
   <h4>Fill up SMTP information in input box </h4>
   <h4>Save SMTP setting  </h4>
   
   Thanks
   </li>
