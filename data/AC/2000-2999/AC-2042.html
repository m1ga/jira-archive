<h3>Description</h3>

I was following the steps in the below document to create a simple window Android project. 

<a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#</a>!/guide/Creating_Your_First_Titanium_Apps

However, I ran into the build error message:

fs.js:338
  return binding.open(pathModule._makeLong(path), stringToFlags(flags), mode);

Error: EPERM, 
operation not permitted 'C:\Users\jim\.titanium\analytics_session.json' 

The configuration log and build log are attached. As a result, the Android Emulator appears but the App doesn't show up in the Emulator.

   Hi Jim,
   
   Do you have full admin and read writes on your user profile in Windows?</li>

   Hi Daniel,
   
   Thank you for the response. Yes, I do have full admin and read rights on my user profile.

   Hello Jim,
   
   Would you mind trying to reinstall node.js and make sure you have the latest version (0.10) try this and let me know of your results. It is also important to point out that though Titanium might work on Vista, we do not officially support the platform (<a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#</a>!/guide/Titanium_Compatibility_Matrix) but we will do our best to help you come to a resolution.
   
   Regards,
   Carter</li>

   Carter: while I agree that Jim should try reinstalling node.js, it should be v0.8.x since we don't support 0.10 yet.
   
   You can check your node.js version by running the following in Terminal:
   
   <code><pre>node -v</pre></code></li>

   Good point, sorry about the confusion, 0.10 had worked for me and I didn't reference the compatibility matrix. Please let us know of your results when you reinstall node version 0.8.13 or higher (up to 0.9, which is not supported).</li>

   Hello Carter and Daniel,
   
   I re-installed the node.js v0.8.24 on my computer but the problem is still there. I also notice the message "Initializing Node.ACS: 30%" at the bottom of Titanium. The progress of the Node.ACS is stuck at 30% all the time. Could this problem results from the incomplete "Initializing" process? 
   
   Thanks,
   Jim</li>

   So that's related to TISTUD-4322. It's strange though, it should work fine with any 0.8.x. Officially though you should use the Node.js version included with Studio.</li>
<li>Daniel Sefton 2013-06-20

   Resolving as needs more info for now. Can you see if it's still occurring with 3.1.1 GA? Also run "node -v" to double check that it's referencing 0.8.
   
   Thanks.</li>
