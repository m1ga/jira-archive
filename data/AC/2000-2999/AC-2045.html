   We have fixed a number of proxy issues with 3.2.1 release that is due to be out later this month. Can you please download and install the latest 3.2.1 beta version to confirm that your issue has been resolved? You can download the latest version from the following link:

   We cannot reproduce this issue with 3.2.1 release and there is really no specific information in this ticket to diagnose this issue further. We would be happy to reopen this ticket if you can provide us steps to reproduce this issue.</li>
