   Hello Bharat,
   
   This usually occurs when a library is not in the correct path. This can be fixed by removing all SDKs from your computer and uninstalling Titanium and reinstalling while downloading all necessary SDKs (iOS, Android, and BB) to their default locations. Please try this and let me know of your results. If this does not fix your problem please provide the logs for the crash and I will look into it further. 
   
   Regards,

   Hello Bharat,
   
   Also which platform are you running this on? And will the sample Hello World app run for you and it is only this app that is having an issue? Please let me know, thanks.
