   It appears that AGCalendar owner has started fixing iOS7 issues so I would suggest you to follow up with him directly. Note that AGCalendar is a 3rd party module that is not part of the Titanium SDK.
   
   It is worth mentioning that our Q&A forum is a more appropriate place for this type of questions.

   Can you please guide me how may i create iOS 7 Calendar view?
   I just use this module for reference. Its better to use your native features of Titanium. Because i don't want to depended on external module.

   I would suggest you to try Titanium Calendar API - <a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#</a>!/api/Titanium.Calendar</li>

   I want to show Calendar view as per iOS 7 Calendar view. I tried Titanium.Calendar but not getting Calendar View. Just showing events, add events.
