<h3>Description</h3>

we've tried CodeBoxed and we've written our own module for Titanium, but both have the same issue.
The module produces amr files only.

The wav files in our custom module does not play as a wav but an amr file with a wav extension in the filename.

What is the solution to this?  Please let us know as this is the last issue blocking us from getting to market.  iOS works great and that app is in the approval queue.

   hi Davide, Ian,
   
   Can you let me know how long this will take to get the help we need? We are really stuck with this as we can't release to the market.  What information can I help provide?
   
   Thanks

   Hello,
   
   I can't really understand your issue: if you are creating a module, I believe the issue is not in Titanium, but there must be something wrong in the native code used in the module itself. Am I missing something?
   
   Thanks</li>
