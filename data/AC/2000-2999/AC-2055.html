<h3>Description</h3>

The Titan Ygor Lemos is running into issue where the list of provisioning profiles is empty when distributing the app via Adhoc/Enterprise. The following info is from Ygor:

<code><pre>
3.0 also have problems with the certificates... They list normally on the CLI (latest version), they are all valid on iOS Provisioning Portal and on XCode 4.5.2

I go to TiStudio, Distribute - AdHoc/Enterprise... the dialog appears, detects everything, SDK v 6, format ipa, location, the I hit Next...

Distribution Certificate detects the correct enterprise (I'm member of 3 companies on the same Apple ID), Keychain: System Defaults the I hit Next again... meanwhile everything is fine...

Now on this screen both items are red, under the select provisioning profile there are no items at all... follows image attached...

Again to reiterate all my certs are listed fine on the CLI.

What is the final command to compile an AdHoc build on the CLI and how to select the proper certificate over there? I can test it if needed....
</pre></code>

   The user tried the following:
   
   Cleaned the following directories:
   
   ~/.titanium/
   ~/Library/Application Support/Titanium
   ~/Library/Preferences/com.appcelerator.titanium...
   ~/Documents/Titanium_Workspace
   
   after that I've restarted Titanium (TiStudio 3 RC2) and it asked to download 2.1.4.GA again... downloaded that. So only 2.1.4.GA is installed. The provisioning profiles showed up. After making changes to the provisioning profiles and refreshed the profiles in Xcode (via organizer refresh). Studio no longer displays provisioning profiles</li>

   I'm going to mark this as a duplicate of TISTUD-3064, as the fix we put there should fix this issue as well.
   
   Thanks.
