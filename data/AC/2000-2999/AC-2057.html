   Also, if I remove ti.compression from the iOS column in eclipse, and compile - will run okay on simulator or device (of course reports ti.compression is missing), but it will compile okay.</li>

   Hi Ozz,
   
   Can you provide a simple test cast that reproduces the issue?</li>

   Hello Ozz,
   
   We were able to open and successfully run the example app that comes with the compression module. This was done on an iPhone 5 (7.0.3).
   
   I realize that there have been several updates to different parts of the environment you indicated on the ticket, so could you please update to the latest version of the TiSDK, CLI, and module and then try your app again?
   Also, since the example app is working, you could consider looking at it's code for examples of how to use the module.
   
   Due to age and a lack of responses, I will be closing this ticket as "could not reproduce".
   Please feel free to re-open this ticket or to let me know if you are still having this issue. Thanks!</li>
</ol>
