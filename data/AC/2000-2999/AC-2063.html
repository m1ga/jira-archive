<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Steps to Reproduce</h4>
Dear Sirs,
Finally I tried to install NodeJS, Titanium CLI and Alloy on my Mac, but there is a big problem with my system password, which is empty (I set it as empty). Then when the NPM Packages Installer ask me to fill in the Password I just type Enter, but I got an error (Sorry, try again).  What can I do to solve this problem?
Moreover, after updating Titanium to the last version and making this attempt to install NodeJs etc. I can't able to transfer my apps to my iPhone anymore! When I click on the Run on iOS device, nothing happens. The windows in which you have to choose the provisioning profile hasn't been shows anymore.
Can you help me please? It's very important.
Thank you and kind regards.
Elvira


<h4>Actual Result</h4>

Password:(I TYPE ENTER BECAUSE MY SYSTEM PASSWORD IS EMPTY!)
Sorry, try again.

<h4>Expected Result</h4>
Password:(ENTER)

   Hello Elvira, 
   Have you tried setting your system password to a string of characters and then entering that? This will let us know if the problem is with an empty password or with something else. Please try changing your password and let us know of the results.

   Dear Carter, 
   Thank you for your reply.
   Is this the procedure to set the password:

   Resetting a user's password in OS X Lion and Mountain Lion

   Yes, that is the right method. In addition to changing your password, the most common fix to these types of problems is to completely reinstall Titanium. Please try this and let me know of your results.

   Dear Carter,
   Thank you for your suggestions.
   I already tried to completely reinstall Titanium, but I have got the same results (I can't install NodeJS, Titanium CLI and Alloy + I can't test apps on my iPhone anymore).
   That's the reason why for the moment I decided to install the previus version of Titanium (2.0.2). Now I can test my apps on my iPhone, as in the past. But I really would like to work with the latest version of Titanium. Then I have to change my system password. This changement won't affect other programs or something else in my Mac, will it?
   Thank you again and kind regards,
   Elvira

   No, the password change will not affect any other programs. Also which OS version of Mac are you using?</li>

   Hello Carter,
   Thank you for your prompt reply.
   I have a Mac Book Pro with Mac OS X Version 10.7.5
   I'm waiting for your reply and then I'll try to set the password (as explained here: <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1274)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1274)</a> and to reinstall Titanium (last version).
   Kind regards,

   Thats fine, I am using the same version. Go ahead and try the password change and reinstall titanium. Everything should be in order. Make sure you are downloading titanium from our main site: appcelerator.com.

   Dear Carter,
   Now everything is ok.
   I changed the system password and successfully upgraded Titanium to the lastest version (3.0.2).
   Thank you very much for your help.
   Kind regards,
