<h3>Description</h3>

It seems like [www.codestrong.com](<a href="http://www.codestrong.com)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.codestrong.com)</a> is still not showing any dates for Codestrong 3.0, which is a serious blocker for releasing this awesome event.

I tried both Safari and Chrome on Mac OS X and even on Android.

<h4>Steps to reproduce</h4>

1. Open your favorite browser
2. Visit [www.codestrong.com](<a href="http://www.codestrong.com)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.codestrong.com)</a>
3. Compare the result with the attached screenshot. It should say *Spring 2014*, but no concrete dates.
4. Hit the *Scroll down* button next to *Okay, you got my attention. Where do I find out more?*
5. Again, find no dates

<h4>Use cases</h4>

There are several use cases for having a date:

1. Plan a family holiday before or after the event
2. Allocate training budgets
3. Get the buzz going
4. Buy cheap tickets

I'm sure there are more use cases. Feel free to add them as comments for this ticket.

<h4>Possible solutions</h4>

A. Pick a date (I'm sure there's an app for that)
B. Cancel it (not recommended given [~jhaynie]'s recent [article on Re/code](<a href="http://recode.net/2014/02/13/why-satya-nadella-has-a-fighting-chance-of-saving-microsoft-from-itself/))" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://recode.net/2014/02/13/why-satya-nadella-has-a-fighting-chance-of-saving-microsoft-from-itself/))</a>

I hope to see this resolved as *Fixed* soon. This *IS* your bug ;)

   We could always have a code-not-as-strong (and show off all the competitor platforms).
   
   Seriously, who do we need to pester to get the ball moving.
   
   My suspicion is that they were waiting for Ti.Next to be released. </li>
