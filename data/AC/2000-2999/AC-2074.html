   We have been unable to reproduce this issue. Can you please try to enable cloud services again by clicking on "Enable Cloud Service" button on tiapp.xml file for your project and let us know if the issue persists?</li>

   Hi, yes. The issue persists and is going on for a month now.
   
   What could possibly be causing this? Can I try resetting some thing? Is there some other way to enable ACS just to work this around for now? </li>

   What's the error message you received? what's the user id you tried to login when trying to enable it? </li>

   The error message says:
   
   Server returned HTTP response code: 400 for URL: <a href="https://api.cloud.appcelerator.com/v1/admins/studio_login.json?key=7fI2AZHmrSvAHNKsSQKzrSXz5NWjo2tt" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://api.cloud.appcelerator.com/v1/admins/studio_login.json?key=7fI2AZHmrSvAHNKsSQKzrSXz5NWjo2tt</a>
   
   The account I use to login to Studio is mine, maimar@gmail.com</li>
<li>Wei Kong 2014-01-07

   does your account maimar@gmail.com work logging to developer.appcelerator.com?</li>
<li>Martín Aimar 2014-01-07

   Yes it does</li>
<li>Wei Kong 2014-01-07

   can you please provide me the guid of your ti app?</li>
<li>Martín Aimar 2014-01-07

   guid for my app: d0d33e78-0a35-4e34-bdd4-233a1852c07d</li>

   [~ragrawal] I don't see any problem with his account, his email is with ACS with 7 acs apps but we don't have any info of this particualar app with guid d0d33e78-0a35-4e34-bdd4-233a1852c07d. If he could provide a tmp password, I could try it manually. Otherwise, we could manually create cloud app for him.</li>
<li>Martín Aimar 2014-01-12

    Sorry, I changed the password for my account and I could enable the Cloud Services in my app. Do you think this has something to do? Old password had spaces in it.</li>
<li>Wei Kong 2014-01-12

    Very likely. [~ragrawal] should we move this to cloudsrv or file a new ticket on this?</li>
<li>Wei Kong 2014-01-14

    I don't know either since this is the first time hearing password allowing space. Perhaps he created a long time ago when spaces were still allowed?</li>
