<h3>Description</h3>

It seems that the click event doesn't provide the rowData attribute anymore. Everything worked fine in 2.1.3GA but since 2.1.4 the rowData attribute seems to be null.

Or is there a special assignment for variables i want to retrieve via rowData?

   It would help if you could provide a small test case that we can drop into a project and run. In the meantime, did you try using "row" instead of "rowData"?</li>

   The issue only occurs if the additional item is specified within a create Method:
   <code><pre>
   Ti.UI.createTableViewRow({
     ...
     myCustomInfo : 'This is important info!',
     ...
   });
   </pre></code>
   In this example you cannot ask for e.rowData.myCustomInfo but only for e.source.myCustomInfo.
   <code><pre>
   var row = Ti.UI.createTableViewRow({
     ...
   });
   row.myCustomInfo = '...';
   </pre></code>
   In this case myCustomInfo is available as e.rowData.myCustomInfo. For now i think this is no bug, but maybe this could be added to the documentation.
   In case you think it's not a bug, you can close the ticket.</li>

   Looks like a bug to me. It would speed things up if you could put together a two-part test case for this, and if I can reproduce I'll move it to TiMob. Cheers.</li>

   Ok, I'll try to provide this as soon as possible.</li>
