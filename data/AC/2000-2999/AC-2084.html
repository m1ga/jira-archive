   Sorry i forgot to add that this is the first app i try to run on titanium.
   I finally managed to get titanium started up with no warnings or errors.
   
   I imported kitchensink through the "develop" tab

   Hey
   
   Im sorry but i have no idea what it is im supposed to do with the answer. I guess its this line you are referring to
    - I copied and pasted the master code from github into androidsdk.py and is now working for me! thanks so much for your help 
   
   Im new to android development and the first thing your startup guide tells me is to import and run kitchen sink and that doesnt work
   
   i dont know what master , github, PR or FR means
   
   So you may call me a newbie. I hpoe you can help me and tell me exactly what im supposed to do to make YOUR example work.
   I dont understand why i have to do things to make your example wotk on your software when i have followed your instructions to the letter.
   
   Thank you </li>

   Hi Alan,
   
   Ok, no problem. You're right that it should work out of the box, unfortunately Google changed some things around with their Android SDK lately which broke our system. You'll need to patch the SDK yourself, which fortunately should be simple in this case.
   
   Back up and then open the following file:
   
   <code><pre>C:\Users\[user]\AppData\Roaming\Titanium\mobilesdk\win32\3.1.0.GA\android\androidsdk.py</pre></code>
   
   Replace its contents with this:
   
   <a href="https://raw.github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/master/support/android/androidsdk.py" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://raw.github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/master/support/android/androidsdk.py</a>
   
   Let me know if it works.</li>

   Hey
   
   
   Thank you very much. Kitchen sink runs perfectly now and i tried alot of the menuitems and no errors. Eralier when i ran on windows 8 i got a error in most of the menu items. But now everything works
