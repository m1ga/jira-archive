<h3>Description</h3>

I installed the beta updates today. 

I used this command for installing alloy 1.3 beta "npm install -g alloy@1.3.0-beta" 

When I tried to install and open my application it said - "sync/util" module not found. I navigate to my alloy folder and checked for the files and "sync/util" was not there.

I have attached the screen shot of alloy 1.2.2 folder which has all the files for your reference. Alloy 1.3 beta doesn't have util.js inside sync.

   [~ewieber] sync/util.js was meant to be a place for common code shared by Alloy's builtin sync adapters. It has since been removed as it really only contained 1 or 2 functions, and it was easier to maintain them in the adapters that actually needed them, rather than adding another file to your distribution. 
   
   What adapter are you using? All of the Alloy adapters, for which util.js was intended, have been updated to reflect its absence. I wonder if you're using a 3rd party adapter that was making use of the undocumented and not-intended-for-public-consumption util.js module. </li>

   I have used custom adapters which was working fine till 3.1.3. I will create a new project with existing alloy adapter and check whether it works and update here. Thank you.</li>

   [~mano_mykingdom] the Titanium SDK version is irrelevant. This is a change between Alloy 1.2.2 and 1.3.0 in an effort to ensure that adapters were standalone and didn't need to be dependent on code specific to an Alloy version. Alloy's builtin adapters will be fine. If 3rd party adapters used the util.js module then they should encounter this error. FYI, this was teh full content of the util.js file before it was deleted:
   
   <code><pre>
   function S4() {
           return (((1+Math.random())*0x10000)|0).toString(16).substring(1);
   };
   
   exports.guid = function() {
           return (S4()+S4()+'-'+S4()+'-'+S4()+'-'+S4()+'-'+S4()+S4()+S4());
   }
   </pre></code></li>

   Sorry, It was my mistake I think. In tiapp.xml I changed the alloy version from 1.2.2 to 1.3.0-beta and it's working fine. Sorry for the confusion and thank you for your clarification.</li>

   Glad to hear this is resolved.
   Closing as invalid bug.</li>
