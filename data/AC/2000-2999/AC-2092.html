   Current workaround: 
   
   Packaging a stand-alone build of your titanium applications can still be achieved today using the older python script. The script is still packaged with the new SDKs, and exists here:
    
   /Users/<your user account>/Library/Application\ Support/Titanium/mobilesdk/osx/<titanium sdk dir>/transport.py 
    
   Following these steps, you should produce a folder with a standalone Xcode project (everything will be copied into your existing build/iphone directory).
    
   + Build your application for simulator or device to generate the initial build folder
   + Open Terminal…
   + Call – python /Users/<your user account>/Library/Application\ + Support/Titanium/mobilesdk/osx/<titanium sdk dir>/transport.py  <Root Directory of Your Project> <SDK VERSION recommend 3.1.0.GA)
   + Zip up the build folder of your project and make available to the build team
   
   NOTE:
   transport.py only copies a few of the files from /assets/iphone and not all of them – it was missing iTunesArtwork, and the retina versions of the splash page.  Run an additional cp command after to just make sure its all copied over.   
   
   cp build/iphone/Resources/iphone* build/iphone/Resources</li>
