   I submitted a JIRA ticket (TC-3433) using Titanium Studio 3.1.3 and it was created successfully so I am unable to reproduce the issue with a simple report. I suspect it may be due to the content in one of the form fields as indicated by the error dialog. I would appreciate if you can try to file a ticket with a very simple string and see if you can reproduce the issue. It would help us troubleshoot the issue more effectively.</li>

   I eventually was able to submit a ticket when I removed quotes and new lines. It's not a very friendly system that just gives a not completely clear error message and throws away your input. It would be nicer if you could go back and edit your submission to correct the errors. Better still, the tool should accept new lines and special characters.</li>

   I am glad that you were able to identify the problem. I tried to reproduce this issue with new line characters and special characters but it worked fine with no issues.
   
   I would be happy to file an improvement request to make this feature more user friendly if you can provide me the exact text that caused the issue in the first place so that we can reproduce this issue in-house.</li>

   Closing this ticket as we have not been able to reproduce this issue and we have not received the requested information for the enhancement request.</li>
