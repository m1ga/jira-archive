<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Steps to Reproduce</h4>
Studio keeps hanging on operations such as switching a project or creating a new alloy default project. This is not 100% reproducible, but has occured about 10 times during my first 3 hours of titanium exploration on Mac Mountain Lion.

- Have Studio with several projects open
- Create new mobile alloy default project
- Enter name and ID
- Click Finish


<h4>Actual Result</h4>
Spinning wheel starts and Studio does not respond anymore.

Had to force quit.

Studio Log:

!ENTRY org.eclipse.osgi 2 1 2013-07-17 15:20:29.170
!MESSAGE NLS missing message: BasicProjectCreationPage_crossPlatformWarningAndroid in: com.appcelerator.titanium.ui.wizard.messages

!ENTRY org.eclipse.osgi 2 1 2013-07-17 15:20:29.170

Set to 'major' as it happened often to me and - while the project is available upon restart - makes you think whether the project is properly created or whether you better delete it and start over again.

<h4>Expected Result</h4>
Wizard to finish without hanging.

   Hello Stefan,
   
   How many projects is several projects when you mentioned that you had several projects opened? I experienced the same issue and found that the problem usually does not occur if I have 5 or less projects opened. I saw hanging process happening a lot more when I had close to 20 projects open. Is there a reason that you need so many open?

   Also can you do me a favor and check to make sure your compatibility matrix matches up?

   Sometimes this behavior occurs when the JDK is version 1.7 when it should be 1.6. Lastly, I recommend a full reinstall of Titanium just to be sure.

   Hi Carter,
   
   I have currently 10 projects open. But had probably 5 when I noticed this behavior first. The use case is 'learning'. That is, you open many of the samples, switch forth and back to compare code and copy pieces etc.
   
   I didn't notice it should be Java 1.6. I actually just installed the latest JDK because the getting-started guide made me think I should. See also this thread: <a href="http://developer.appcelerator.com/question/154954/ide-crashes-very-often" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://developer.appcelerator.com/question/154954/ide-crashes-very-often</a>
   
   $ java -version
   java version "1.7.0_25"
   Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_25-b15)
   Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 23.25-b01, mixed mode)
   
   But the Studio Diagnostic Test points to:
   /System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk/Contents/Home
   
   
   $ node --version
   v0.10.13
   
   XCode:
   Version 4.6.3
   
   
   
   I will install Node 0.8.13 and reinstall Titanium.
   
   I also noticed intermittent hangs when I switch between projects or when I right-click on an item in the project explorer on the left-hand side.
   
   Maybe Studio's diagnostic test could better point out any issues.

   Hello Carter,
   
   I installed node 0.8.13 and verified I am running on this version.
   
   I re-insatlled Titanium Studio. Please note the following:
   
   Upon first start of studio I was asked to update various components such as alloy and node. I was told that Node will be updated to 0.8.22. However node --version yields 0.10.13 after updating Studio is done.
   
   The compatibility matrix says: "The 0.9 (development) builds are not supported." So I assume the 0.10 builds aren't either.
   
   I guess I am back at where I started. Should I remove Java 1.7 and ensure there is only 1.6 RE on my system?
   
   I will also make sure I have less than 5 projects open at a time.
   
   Kind regards,
   Stefan

   Just noticed that there is also a yellow popup in the lower right corner in Studio, telling me Node 0.8.22 was installed when however 0.10.13 got installed.

   Hi Stefan,
   
   To clarify, you need to have have JRE 1.6 and NOT 1.7. You should uninstall/remove 1.7 before installing 1.6. When installing Titanium studio, Node.js cannot be downgraded, this is why your version is still 0.10.13. You need to remove it from your computer (uninstall) then install 0.8.22. There are many tutorials around the web on how to do this.
   
   Best,

   Thanks for the quick reply, Carter.
   
   I will follow your instructions.
   
   Note however that my Node version was 0.8.13.
   
   Best,
   Stefan</li>
<li>Stefan Funk 2013-07-18

   
   I removed node and java 1.7 manually. Rebooted and verified the versions as follows:
   
   dev-box:~ stefanfunk$ node -v
   v0.8.13
   
   dev-box:~ stefanfunk$ java -version
   java version "1.6.0_51"
   Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_51-b11-457-11M4509)
   Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 20.51-b01-457, mixed mode)
   
   I then installed Titanium and had it update (to node 0.8.22 as it said).
   
   Note: after installing Titanium Studio, I get the following versions:
   
   dev-box:~ stefanfunk$ node -v
   v0.10.13
   dev-box:~ stefanfunk$ java -version
   java version "1.6.0_51"
   Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_51-b11-457-11M4509)
   Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 20.51-b01-457, mixed mode)
   dev-box:~ stefanfunk$ 
   
   
   Uninstalled node and Titanium again. Installed Node 0.8.22 and then Titanium. Titanium did not ask to update node, as expected.
   
   Checked version of node:
   
   dev-box:share stefanfunk$ node -v
   v0.8.22
   
   Studio diagnostic check: Node.JS Version: v0.8.22
   
   
   So, from a Java and Node perspective I should be fine now.
   
   Please note, that i.m.o. Studio updated to node 0.10.13 if a version less than 0.8.22 is installed.
   
   Thanks again for your help - hope it runs more stable now.
   Stefan
