<h3>Description</h3>

After updating Titanium to 3.0(during update it installed alloy) I was expecting to see Alloy template option in Titanium Mobile Project Wizzard but apparently it's not there. I can use CLI to create default alloy project which simply create 'Hello world' window and that's it. Please see attached screenshots.

   Hi Andrey,
   
   Sadly I can't see any screenshots attached. I believe you can attach them by going to Edit.
   
   But, 3.0.2 should fix that for you. Can you clarify?
   
   Thanks!</li>
