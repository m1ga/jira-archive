<h3>Description</h3>

Places query which has been in production for almost a year suddenly has stopped working as of today. 
Specifically it gives a 200 response that is empty. 
This is a location based app so effectively the app doesn't work at all.

I checked and the places still exist on the ACS backend. I don't want to paste the key here but the app is called Bubele Mobile on ACS if you want to take a look. The request below gives the empty 200 response

   Hi N Morris,
   
   We have fixed the issue. It would be great if you could try again and let us know the outcome.
