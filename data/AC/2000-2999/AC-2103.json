Correct me if I am wrong but are these the series of actions you are taking?\n\n1. Load up the app\n2. Press \"Buy\" button\n3. Press \"Buy\" button again on subsequent pop up\n4. Payment successful alert pops up\n\nat this point, there have been many alerts towards the bottom of my screen giving me Request IDs and states that I am currently in.. after the payment successful pop up, I get an alert with the message seen in screenshot I attached. If you are getting something different (or nothing at all) then it may have something to do with using an older version of Android. Can you do me a favor and try this code out on an emulator with a higher android version (3.0 or higher), if it works as expected here we can rule out any issues with your build/studio and I can report a bug that this doesn't work on earlier versions of android. \n\nThanks for your cooperation and patience, I will be awaiting your reply,\nCarter",

					"body": "Hi Carter, I'm fairly confident this is a problem within the Google Play service. The following link is to a screenshot of my Google Play account. You can see that between May 19 and May 26 revenue stopped. I can confirm during this period that I have debugged my app and found that PURCHASE_STATE_CHANGED was never received, and the app appeared to hang. On May 25 I started looking for a workaround and something triggered Google Play to again respond to purchase requests, so clearly without any change in the published app, Google Play is showing different behavior on different days.  https://www.box.com/s/e0r5c4pnm4kdd37bihb9\r\n\r\nAlso, here are several links showing that this problem has been reported for two years now, without being addressed:\r\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/android-developers/RoAEFI8-NBs\r\nhttps://code.google.com/p/marketbilling/issues/detail?id=29\r\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/16217272/with-new-in-app-billing-com-android-vending-billing-purchase-state-changed-inte\r\n\r\nThis is clearly a serious issue because, if it happens during restoreTransactions() it will appear to cause the app to hang waiting for a response and the developer loses the customer, and if it happens during requestPurchase() then Google happily completes the purchase and charges the customer without notifying the app to deliver the content. The fact that I've seen this happen with both restoreTransactions() and requestPurchase() is further indicator of a Google problem. The workaround I'm going with is to set a brief timer and send restoreTransactions() a second time if PURCHASE_STATE_CHANGED is not received, but there is really no way to prove that this works. \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nDavid",
