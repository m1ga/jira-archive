<h3>Description</h3>

After I upgraded my App to use sdk 3.1, I found some strange behavior with in application:

1)Both the tss present in root and platform specific is getting applied.This seems to be Alloy 1.1 issue as when we run this with alloy 1.0 it worked fine.

2)Background images in view are getting stretched, that were coming perfectly fine with SDK 3.0.2.

Attaching the sample source code that describe this issue.

Please let me know any fixes for this.

   This is by design. As of 1.1.0, styles are merged together instead of one outright replacing the other. So now, your root style is being merged with the platform-specific style. This allows for less redundant styling and more style reuse.</li>
