   Your error message indicates that you are using Titanium SDK version 3.2.0 with CLI version 3.2.1. This is a supported configuration but we recommend you to upgrade to SDK 3.2.1 as it includes several key fixes and improvements.
   
   Please attach output of "ti info" command to diagnose this issue further. </li>

   Hi Ritu.
   
   Yep, the log I've copied was my second attempt using SDK 3.2.0 to see if it worked, but previously I've tested it with 3.2.1 and the result was the same. Tomorrow I will send the full ti.info command, when I go to the office.</li>

   Guys, we need to get it addressed as a matter of priority!!! As our team member fails to run any apps after update!!!</li>

   Nothing unusual with "ti info" output. Next step would be to check "ti config" output. Can you please attach the same?</li>

   Here are happening strange things. Now the error dissapeared "alone" (well, is another day, I restarted Windows), but I'm still unable to know if it works (no compiling errors, but now all my SDKs dissapeared and always I hit Run, the Config Run screen appears with no emulator to select).
   
   Any way, the ti.config:
   
   <code><pre>
   android.ndkPath        = ""
   android.sdkPath        = "D:\\Mobile\\adt-bundle\\sdk"
   app.sdk                = "latest"
   app.workspace          = ""
   cli.colors             = true
   cli.completion         = false
   cli.failOnWrongSDK     = false
   cli.httpProxyServer    = ""
   cli.ignoreDirs         = "^(\\.svn|_svn|\\.git|\\.hg|\\.?[Cc][Vv][Ss]|\\.bzr|\\$RECYCLE\\.BIN)$"
   cli.ignoreFiles        = "^(\\.gitignore|\\.npmignore|\\.cvsignore|\\.DS_Store|\\._.*|[Tt]humbs.db|\\.vspscc|\\.vssscc|\
   \.sublime-project|\\.sublime-workspace|\\.project|\\.tmproj)$"
   cli.logLevel           = "trace"
   cli.progressBars       = true
   cli.prompt             = false
   cli.quiet              = false
   cli.rejectUnauthorized = true
   cli.width              = 100
   paths.commands         = []
   paths.hooks            = []
   paths.modules          = []
   paths.plugins          = []
   paths.sdks             = []
   user.locale            = "es"
   </pre></code>
   
   Can I go back to Ti 3.2.0? I need a stable version to work, I lost 2 working days with all this things...</li>
<li>Ritu Agrawal 2014-02-13

   You can move back to 3.2.0 CLI by using the following command:
   
   npm install -f titanium@3.2.0
   
   We would love to diagnose this issue with 3.2.1 CLI though so it would be great if you can provide complete build log file (and a project if possible) to reproduce the problem.</li>

   Thank you very much for your diagnosis and patience. I am resolving this ticket as a duplicate if TIMOB-16074.</li>
