		"description": "Hi, I've developed an iOS (iPAD + iPHONE) application using Titanium 2.1.2 and Titanium SDK 2.0.1.GA2 on Xcode 4.3.2. This application uses both horizontal and vertical scrollviews (organized in a tree of three layer for details) to show many contents. \r\nThe source code for the scrollview tree creation is shown in the attached Visita.js\r\n\r\nHere at each horizontal scroll a new \"subtree\" of scrollviews is created, in order to browse lower layers (views).\r\n\r\nIt works well for iPad IF I compile under Titanium 2.1.2 on Titanium SDK 2.0.1.GA2, Xcode 4.3.2.\r\nThe issue happens when I switch between 2.0.1.GA2 (Xcode 4.3.2) and 2.1.3.GA(Xcode 4.5.1), with NO code changes...\r\n\r\nAs shown in the attached videos, the horizontal scroll from a view to another one is fast by compiling under 2.0.1.GA2, and also details are created quite istantaneously to be browsed in vertical scroll.\r\n\r\nBy compiling under 2.1.3.GA the scroll between views is incredibly slow, unusable. \r\nFurthermore, when the movie scrolls down, the view shown is not the correct one, and it is updated without interaction suddenly.. \r\nIt seems that the new SDK needs much more time to do the same things done with the old SDK.\r\n\r\nFinally, a view overlapping flashes..\r\n\r\nit seems to be a Titanium SDK bug, no code changes are made between the two movies...\r\n\r\nNOTE: the same happens when I compile from Titanium SDK 2.0.1.GA2 to SDK 2.1.0.GA (with the same xcode 4.3.2), so the issue could be in the transition to 2.1.0.GA",

					"body": "Hi Daniel,\n\nsorry for the delay..\nI have attached MuseoLight.zip file containing the Titanium Project.\n\nI have reduced the project, by deleting other views and windows which are not affected by the scrollview slowness bug reported.\n\nBriefly, the application is composed by a starting view where you can click on 'English', then on 'The Museum'.\n\nHere you access the scrollview part of the application. It is composed by three levels, in order to browse three (originally much more, as you can see by the movie) museum rooms, each room with several pieces, each piece with several details.\n\nLevel1\nSpecifically, in the project you have three rooms: Mappamondo, Pace, Pilastri\n\nLevel2\nMappamondo has 4 pieces,\nPace has 3 pieces,\nPilastri has 2 pieces.\n\nLevel3\nMappamondo piece1 has 3 details,\nMappamondo piece2 has 4 details,\nMappamondo piece3 has 3 details,\nPace piece1 has 4 details,\nPace piece2 has 5 details,\nPace piece3 has 4 details,\nPilastri piece1 has 0 details,\nPilastri piece2 has 0 details.\n\nON THE CODE SIDE: \nby clicking on 'The museum' on the menu.js, you launch Visita.js\n\nVisita.js creates an array of views which will be scrolled horizontally, for all the rooms (viewSaleArray - by calling creaSale), for all the pieces concerning the first room (viewOpereArray - by calling creaOpere), for all the details of the first piece of the first room (viewDettagliArray - by calling creaDettagli).\nFurthermore, it creates the first \"column\" of views (Mappamondo room - all Mappamondo pieces - all Mappamondo piece1 details), for vertical scroll (viewVerticalArray).\nAt each horizontal scroll, it creates the new \"column\" of views (for vertical scroll) by starting from the reached room.\nIf you scroll horizontally at piece level, only details array for the reached piece are created.\n\nCOMPILING:\n\nIf you compile this project with Titanium SDK 2.0.1.GA2 and try it in on a real ipad (i.e. ipad 2 or new), everything will be OK, scroll is fast and you can reach immediately each image you want (i.e. by scrolling right-right-down you immediately reach pilastri piece1, with no flashings).\n\nIf you compile this project with Titanium SDK 2.1.3.GA, 2.1.0.GA, 2.1.4.GA) and try it in on a real ipad (i.e. ipad 2 or new), the scroll is very slow, unusable. Furthermore, by scrolling right-right-down you does NOT immediately reach pilastri piece1, but you first see Mappamondo piece1 (with Mappamondo piece2 flashing up on the right), then it switches to Pace piece1 (with Pace piece2 flashing), then it reaches Pilastri piece1.\n\nFinally, Pilastri piece2 is visible (by scrolling right from pilastri piece1) when compiled with 2.0.1.GA2, but this is not reachable compiling with 2.1.0.GA, 2.1.3GA, 2.1.4GA...\n\nany ideas?\n\nThank you for your time\n\nRiccardo",

					"body": "Hi Riccardo,\n\nThanks for the test case. I don't have 2.1.0 installed, but I've tested and confirmed the issue between 2.0.3 and 2.1.2 GA. What's interesting is that on 2.1.2 the first and second scroll view rows lag when dragging horizontally, but the third row is smooth as expected. Vertical scrolling is also still smooth.\n\nAs for your second issue, I think for now we should focus on the scroll lag. There's far too much code for me to go through and debug the logic, which actually will be much easier without the lag, and it may be related.\n\nIt would be even better if you could further narrow down the horizontal scrolling lag issue, for example, we might be able to reproduce it simply by having 1 row, and you can try removing the sub views as well to leave just the images, and also take out the database. Our engineering team will want a more specific test case before I can move this to TiMob.\n\nThanks!",

					"body": "Hi Daniel\r\n\r\nok, I'm going to reduce the code in order to focus only on horizontal scroll.\r\n\r\nHowever, as you can see there is no problem (only a little delay, but acceptable) with 2.0.X SDKs, so I think that the problem is something concerning memory or processor allocation (inefficiency?) in 2.1.X SDKs.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the delay in showing the Pilastri piece1 is a result of a loading delay of previous \"column of views\"...\r\n\r\nI also suppose that, if I remove the huge (but still accptable in 2.0.X SDKs) computational work needed to load subtrees (vertical views tree), images etc., the scrollview lag issue will smooth or disappear... but our app need such complexity to be a good app.. \r\n\r\nActually, we need to \"come back\" to resource management of 2.0.X SDKs, hopefully preserving 2.1.X benefits for all the other issues.\r\n\r\nHowever, you'll receive the horizontal scrollview project as soon as possible (within tomorrow morning?)\r\n\r\nthanks so much\r\n\r\nRiccardo",
