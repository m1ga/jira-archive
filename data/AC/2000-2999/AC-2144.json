Now go back to the 1st tab and start closing windows (getting back on the drill down).\r\n\r\nOnce you reach the parent, the app crashes and closes completely.\r\n\r\nTitanium doesn't generate any logs.\r\n\r\nI did got a crash report though.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor closing the windows I've tried to use simple window.close() and also the close() method of the tabgroup. both generated the same result.\r\n\r\nCan someone enlighten-me towards what is crashing here? I saw some references to redraw issues on the crash report coming from TiViewProxy.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe crash reports are attached. All derived from the same bug reproduction.\r\n\r\nAlso attached is a video file showing the behavior.",

But I also got back to the issue i was having:\nusing the native tabgroup, drilling down the navgroups a couple windows in the navgroups on the first 2 tabs (app has 2) and then switching to the 3rd tab is crashing the app. Curiously, it seems that the cause is exactly the same reported by Ygor.\n\nSince I was getting a EXC_BAD_ACCESS, I executed the app from Xcode with Zombie Objects enabled to track down the problem. And look at that, redraw problem coming from TiViewProxy.\n",
