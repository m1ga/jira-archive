   Hello Sivaram,
   
   We have been unable to reproduce the issue you are seeing. As an alternative to importing you can try to copy the project files to a new project. To do this, could you please do the following:
   1. Create a new project
   2. Copy all project files, except for the tiapp.xml, from your existing project (that you tried to import) into this new project, overwriting when necessary (You may need to re-add in any modules that your app requires)
   3. Try to build and run the new project
   
   If the build continues to fail, please send us any output or log files from your app's session.
   </li>

   Marking this as "Cannot reproduce". Please comment if you need further help on this. If we don't hear back, we will close it permanently in a week.</li>
