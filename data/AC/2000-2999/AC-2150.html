<h3>Description</h3>

Just updated to Titanium Studio 3.1.2 and a current project that has been building just fine suddenly will not build. I'm attempting to build for iOS and run on the iPhone simulator. Project builds fine on Android.

   Please can you attach your Studio log file and diagnostic? (Both found at Help -> Studio)
   
   But I imagine that if you run this in Terminal:
   
   <code><pre>node -v</pre></code>
   
   That you will have 0.10.x installed. If that's the case, try downgrading to 0.8.x (most compatible version is 0.8.22)</li>

   Hello David,
   
   Can you do me a favor and try cleaning and rebuilding the project and see if that also makes any difference. Besides that my next best guess to the issue would be what Daniel suggested. 
   
   Thanks,

   I cleaned and attempted to rebuild again to no avail. Next I downgraded to Node v0.8.22. Restarted the machine and checked the version of node, confirmed it was v08.22. Cleaned the project and attempted to rebuild. Here is the error I got:
   [ERROR] :  ** BUILD FAILED **
   [ERROR] :  The following build commands failed:
   [ERROR] :  	PhaseScriptExecution Pre-Compile "build/Find It! Harrisonville.build/Debug-iphonesimulator/Find It! Harrisonville.build/Script-241EAF36118E30260081A5BE.sh"
   [ERROR] :  (1 failure)
   
   Log and Diagnostic attached.</li>

   This morning I updated to the latest build (Titanium Studio, build: 3.1.2.201307171728) in hopes that the problem was fixed in this build. I cleaned the project and attempted a build. I got the same "PhaseScriptExecution Pre-Compile" error that I got in my 17/Jul/13 4:49 PM comment above. I decided to focus on my code. I commented out the file that I had been working on, cleaned the project and performed a build. The build was successful. I found a couple of instances where curly braces were misplaced, I fixed them and now my project builds. Thank you for your prompt attention, please close out this ticket.</li>

   Yeah, TC-2233 was a code issue too. Thanks, closing.</li>
