The app stops after displaying the splash screen - it seems that app.js is not loaded

<h4>Steps to reproduce</h4>
1. Create an app with Titanium 2.x
2. Run on Device
3. Upgrade SDK to 3.0.0
4. Run on Device (then we noticed several bugs and decided to use the new debugger)
5. Debug on Device (we noticed that debugging was to difficult at the moment and decided to switch back to 2.1.4.GA which we used before)
6. Downgrade to 2.1.4.GA
7. Run on Device

Now the app always stops at the splash screen, maybe it's waiting for the remote debugger.

<h4>Additional details</h4>
I've noticed that two times on my Device and thought that my machine was wrong configured.

Now i tried the same with KitchenSink again and reproduced the error as described above. So i think that this is no misconfiguration. The only way to get rid of this error seems to reset the whole device. I'll try that (i already did this the first time the error occured but i thought it was a configuration problem as [described here](<a href="http://developer.appcelerator.com/question/146536/android-app-doesnt-start-anymore-after-back-switch-from-sdk-30" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://developer.appcelerator.com/question/146536/android-app-doesnt-start-anymore-after-back-switch-from-sdk-30</a> and here: <a href="http://developer.appcelerator.com/question/146536/android-app-doesnt-start-anymore-after-back-switch-from-sdk-30)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://developer.appcelerator.com/question/146536/android-app-doesnt-start-anymore-after-back-switch-from-sdk-30)</a>

I thought again and again what i did today and finally i remembered that i used the on-device debugging. in both cases i did this and so i tried to reproduce this with KitchenSink and the error occurs.

   Resetting the device is no soultion. Instead you should run the app again with SDK 3.0.0 in non-debug mode and THEN switch back to 2.1.4.GA. After that the app is running correctly.</li>

   @Markus Wutzler Can you please provide Console logs?
   
   You can check the [JIRA Ticket Checklist](<a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#</a>!/guide/How_to_Submit_a_Bug_Report-section-29004732_HowtoSubmitaBugReport-JIRATicketChecklist) and complete this issue. Cause this ticket misses crucial information that must be included in order for a ticket to be accepted.</li>

   [~egomez] Sorry, but I'm working on commercial projects and providing all the logs would require too much time. The build.log files are at least equal except that i used SDK 3.0.0 instead of 2.1.4. So I don't think that this would be very helpful. Are there any other logs? Unfortunately our app doesn't work with SDK 3.0 at the moment.</li>
<li>Markus Wutzler 2013-01-26

   you can also take a look at the log files attached to [TC-1730]. They contain the same information.</li>

<li>Markus Wutzler 2013-02-01

   yes, unfortunately log files from 2.x are missing</li>
<li>Eduardo Gomez 2013-02-02

   Without all the information issues can't be escalated.
   
   Please attach missing logs to adhere to [jira checklist](<a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#</a>!/guide/How_to_Submit_a_Bug_Report-section-29004732_HowtoSubmitaBugReport-JIRATicketChecklist) and replicate quicker.
   
   Once they have been attached, I'd be happy to look into it.</li>
