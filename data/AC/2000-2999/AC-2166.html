<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Steps to Reproduce</h4>
inserted code from TI. When I get to the page that has the drop down box for the date picker it is large with the roll (month, day, year) then the calender.  I would like only the caldender only. Additionally, when picking the date it does not show in the drop down box after selection.

<h4>Actual Result</h4>
entering the screen receive a two piece calender before other items are inputed that are above the calender drop down.

<h4>Expected Result</h4>
would like calender and the date to be shown in the box

   Hello Ron,
   
   I would be glad to help you out with this issue. To clarify, you are seeing this issue on iOS correct? Also, is this the code you are testing with, it is from the TI docs here (<a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#</a>!/api/Titanium.UI.Picker-method-showDatePickerDialog)?:
   
   <code><pre>
   Ti.UI.backgroundColor = 'white';
   var win = Ti.UI.createWindow({
     exitOnClose: true,
     layout: 'vertical'
   });
   
   var picker = Ti.UI.createPicker({
     type:Ti.UI.PICKER_TYPE_DATE,
     minDate:new Date(2009,0,1),
     maxDate:new Date(2014,11,31),
     value:new Date(2014,3,12),
     top:50
   });
   
   win.add(picker);
   win.open();
   
   picker.addEventListener('change',function(e){
     Ti.API.info("User selected date: " + e.value.toLocaleString());
   });
   </pre></code>
   
   If not, please provide the code sample where you are seeing this issue as it will ensure that we are both on the same page and I can assist you further. For this code sample, I am only able to see a scrollable date picker. Would you mind elaborating on how to see the calendar or provide the code that shows this?
   
   Thanks,
   Carter</li>
