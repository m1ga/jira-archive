<h3>Description</h3>

Whenever I scroll the picker, for the first time there seems to be a small lag in scrolling. That is, when user scrolls the picker, there is a lag for few seconds and then users are allowed to scroll records continuously. This lags happens only for the first time.
First I thought it was a issue with by code, so I posted an issue here in  [Q&A](<a href="https://developer.appcelerator.com/question/161965/titanium-picker-scrolling-lags-for-the-first-time)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://developer.appcelerator.com/question/161965/titanium-picker-scrolling-lags-for-the-first-time)</a> But later I tried with default options like below and still the same. Seems like {color:red}by default there is a time lag with titanium UI picker{color}
 
<code><pre>
var picker = Ti.UI.createPicker({
  top:50
});
  
var data = [];
for (var i = 0; i < 500; i++)
{
  data[i]=Ti.UI.createPickerRow({title:'Bananas' + i});
}

picker.add(data);
picker.selectionIndicator = true;

win = Ti.UI.createWindow ({backgroundColor : 'black'});  
win.add(picker);
win.open();
</pre></code>

Hope this can be easily reproduced by others.

   We have not been able to reproduce any time lag even after populating the picker with 500 entries. I have updated your sample so that it can run as it is. We tried it on Samsung Galaxy Nexus device.
   
   I noticed that you listed SDK version as 1.7.6. Is that correct? If yes, I would strongly recommend you to build your sample code with 3.2.0 SDK.</li>
