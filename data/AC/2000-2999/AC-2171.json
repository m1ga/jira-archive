		"description": "Whenever I scroll the picker, for the first time there seems to be a small lag in scrolling. That is, when user scrolls the picker, there is a lag for few seconds and then users are allowed to scroll records continuously. This lags happens only for the first time.\r\nFirst I thought it was a issue with by code, so I posted an issue here in  [Q&A|https://developer.appcelerator.com/question/161965/titanium-picker-scrolling-lags-for-the-first-time] But later I tried with default options like below and still the same. Seems like {color:red}by default there is a time lag with titanium UI picker{color}\r\n \r\n{code:xml}\r\nvar picker = Ti.UI.createPicker({\r\n  top:50\r\n});\r\n  \r\nvar data = [];\r\nfor (var i = 0; i < 500; i++)\r\n{\r\n  data[i]=Ti.UI.createPickerRow({title:'Bananas' + i});\r\n}\r\n\r\npicker.add(data);\r\npicker.selectionIndicator = true;\r\n\r\nwin = Ti.UI.createWindow ({backgroundColor : 'black'});  \r\nwin.add(picker);\r\nwin.open();\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nHope this can be easily reproduced by others.",
