<h3>Description</h3>

The title is pretty explanatory, I opened a private HD ticket with an testcase to the real server

   Unable to reproduce with SDK 2.1.3.v20120928203111 with Xcode 4.5/iOS 6.0 target on:
   iPhone 4s (5.0.1)
   iPhone 4s (6.0)
   iPhone 4 (5.1.1)
   iPhone 3GS (4.3)
   
   We are seeing no errors in console and server data is returning. </li>

   Hi Eric, 
   Sorry for asking, but are you sure you tested with the testcase I submitted?
   
   The url you need to go has a different port (included into the url) and also a basic auth header.
   So maybe is a combination between this two ?
   
   I'll try to extend the example but I cannot post it here as server data is real and therefore the HD ticket is private.
   
   Thank you</li>

   Ok, this is very awkward. 
   It is working now without any change. The only thing that can explain is that was some issue with the carrier.
   On the laptop I had my landline ISP but on the mobile I was on the mobile connection.
   I tested today with more configurations (Edge, 3G, wifi with 2 ISP) and seems to work fine.
   
   Sorry for the mess.</li>

   No worries, Mr. Tamas, It's much better to err on the side of caution. Moving that we resolve this as a 'cannot reproduce'.</li>
