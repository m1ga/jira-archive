<h3>Description</h3>

Titanium SDK version 3.2.0.GA
CLI version 3.2.0
Alloy 1.0
OS: Windows 7
Emulator: android 4.4

I'm just now beginning Titanium and application development. I can't get the emulator to run the sample code. The following error occurs:

[ERROR] :  Emulator failed to start in a timely manner
The current timeout is set to 120000 ms
[ERROR] Application Installer abnormal process termination. Process exit value was 1

Any help will be appreciated.

   Android emulator can be tricky at times and you may run into this error at times. I would suggest you to close the Android emulator and Studio and then relaunch the Studio. Run a project on Android emulator and make sure to unlock the emulator once you see the emulator lock screen. Let us know how it goes.</li>
