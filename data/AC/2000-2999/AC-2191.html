<h3>Description</h3>

As of Titanium 3.0.0 I am getting errors and problems because Titanium will apparently use every single .jss file it can find anywhere in the Resources directory and subdirectories.

My project is designed for iOS and Android. The JSS is stored in around ten different files for each platform. So this is what it looks like:

iOS: File "Resources\app.iphone.jss" uses @import to include ten files in "Resources\jss" folder.

Android: File "Resources\Android\global.jss" uses @import to include ten files in "Resources\Android\jss" folder.

This used to work fine from Titanium 1.8.2 up to 2.1.4. When I tried to upgrade to Titanium 3.0.0 the following happened when compiling *for iPhone or iPad*:

- the compiler seems unable to find app.iphone.jss or the regular \jss folder.
- the compiler does find the global.jss, includes it, and throws errors about not being able to understand the @import commands.

So my app ends up opening without any JSS applied, i.e. broken.
