   Hi Prasanth,
   
   A lot of updates/changed happened in TiSDK 3.X.X. So I would like to request to visit this [release notes link| <a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/release-notes/?version=3.0.0.GA#breaking" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/release-notes/?version=3.0.0.GA#breaking</a>]. 
   
   Please check you npm, node.js and CLI version to be compatible with the latest TISDK. If the problem persists, please let us know.
   
   Thanks
   </li>

   [~prashant.shukla] We recently released Titanium SDK + Studio 3.2.0 GA release that includes many new features, enhancements, performance improvements and bug fixes. We would recommend you to upgrade to the most recent version and let us know if you run into any issue.</li>

   I can reproduce this issue now with Studio 3.2.0 and SDK 3.0.2. It is a duplicate of TISTUD-6013 that is under investigation. Please track that ticket for further updates.</li>
