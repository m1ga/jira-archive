<h3>Description</h3>

In the example code it says in <code>app.js</code>, starting on line 37:

<code><pre>
1) Storekit works in two different environments: "Live" and "Sandbox". It automatically uses the "Sandbox" when you
 run your app in Xcode. This means that "Deploy to Device" in Titanium Studio will connect to the "Live" environment!
 Using a test account in "Live" will ruin the test account. And paying for items with a live account will quickly
 suck up your hard earned cash. So be careful!
</pre></code>

I ran an app over "Deploy to Device" as well as "Ad Hoc/Enterprise" distribution and in the simulator, but it always works in "Sandbox". Be aware that I'm not talking about TC-2329! It shows when you login to do a purchase, using a live Apple ID. You will get a system alert (not generated in the app) telling you to use a Test User for the sandbox environment it's in, as shown in the attached image.

The only environment in which you are *not* in sandbox, is when distributed via the App Store. The comments in the <code>app.js</code> should be updated for that.

   Double checked:
   
   * The Ad Hoc distribution WAS signed with a distribution certificate, not a development.
   * I was signed out of any Test User account before doing the purchase.</li>

   Updated comment in app.js file. Updated module (version 2.0.2) will be in the MarketPlace shortly.</li>

   Yes, the comments in the example are now correct</li>
