<h3>Description</h3>

I am using map view in my titanium mobile web app, where the user can access map from multiple places. But the problem which I am facing is, if the user opens a map for the first time, the map comes fine, but if the user tries to open the map for the second time, the map doesn't covers the complete screen, it occupies only small portion of top left of the screen. Is it a bug ? Please provide any solution. The same functionality is working fine for android and iOS.

I am also able to drag the map on screen.

   "The same functionality is working fine for android and iOS." - So it doesn't happen on mobile, are you talking about Desktop?
   Please provide a reproducible test case. I will re-open once this is present.
   Thanks.</li>
