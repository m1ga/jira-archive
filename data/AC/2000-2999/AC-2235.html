   Hi Ron,
   
   So just to clarify, the adb, conhost, node, and python processes are being duplicated every time you run an app? That doesn't sound good.
   
   Please can you attach a screenshot of the Task Manager with these duplicate processes?
   
   Also, it would be great if you could go into a bit more detail about your setup - you're running the app in the Android emulator, right? At which point are the processes duplicated? Do you simply run the app, stop the debugger, then re-run the app and this occurs?
   
   Thanks for your time.</li>

   Any resolution on this issue?
   Reproduces for me on latest Titanium Studio build: 3.1.3.201309132423 Build: jenkins-titanium-rcp-master-21 (origin/master)
   Date: 13 September 2013, 00:23:57
   OS: Win7 x32
   
   Not sure when the processes duplicate but it seems like each time you run a debug new instances of node.exe conhost.exe adb.exe and python.exe start and are kept alive until you force-close them.
   In total each instance of these 4 processes consumes about 50Mb of memory, so after 20 debugs you already have -1Gb of free memory - that quickly becomes a problem
   
   Also, processes do not close if you exit Titanium Studio.
   
   And another note - python.exe seems to be the parent to all processes, cuz they all close if you close python instances</li>

   Tested with latest Ti Studio, can't reproduce it. </li>
