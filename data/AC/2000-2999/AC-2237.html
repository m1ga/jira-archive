<h3>Description</h3>

In my application I have a navigation group and views are allowed to be displayed only in portrait mode. Here's the issue: When I open a modal window that allows portrait and both landscape orientations the app crashes when I try to close the modal window in landscape mode. I mean, you can see that the status bar is adjusting the orientation to portrait but the modal window remains in landscape and does not disappear. When I touch the close button a second time the modal window disappears and the screen goes black.
When I turn the device to portrait mode before activating the close button, everything works perfectly well and as expected.

I run the same tests on a device running the latest version of iOS 6. The modal window is dismissed correctly in landscape mode here.

   Hi Martin,
   
   We would really appreciate it if you could create a simple test case that we can drop into an app.js and run to reproduce the issue.
   
   Also please state your Ti SDK version.
   
   Thanks for your time.</li>
