<h3>Description</h3>

I have been trying to publish an update to an old app.  I initially built the update with Titanium 2.1.2, Xcode 4.3 and ios SDK 5.1.

When I submitted the app I received feedback from Apple that the app crashed on IOS6.  

To rectify that problem I installed Xcode 4.5 and the current build of Titanium 2.1.3.  When I compiled and submitted the app it failed the automatic validation check giving the following message:

"iPhone/iPod Touch: application executable is missing a required architechture.  At least one of the following architechture(s) must be present:armv6"

I looked at the Q&A and found a suggested modification to the info.plist file to sort that out.  When I next submitted the app I then got another error from the automatic validation process:

"This bundle is invalid.  The key UIRequiredDeviceCapabilities in the Info.plist may not contain values that would prevent this application from running on devices that were supported by previous versions."

I then realised that ios 6 only supports armv7 so is no use for updating an existing app that has been published to armv6 devices.

I have downloaded Xcode 4.3 and copied the ios 5.1 SDK to the my Xcode 4.5 installation and installed the iPhone 5.1 simulator.

I then tried to build my app with Titanium 2.1.3 and ios SDK 5.1.  The packaging failed with the following error in builder.py:

~~~
[ERROR] /Users/des/Apps/iLoyalty/build/iphone/Classes/TiApp.mm:627:12: error: cannot initialize return object of type 'NSUInteger' (aka 'unsigned int') with an rvalue of type 'id'

    sys.exit(rc)
SystemExit: 65

I appreciated that 2.1.3 is a work in progress at the moment, but supporting SDK 5.1 in order to maintain existing app will be necessary.

   I apologise, this can be closed as an erroroneously reported bug.
   
   I have resubmitted the app building with ios sdk6 and the min-ios-version 4.3 info.plist fix and the app has been accepted without problem.
   
   Many thanks
