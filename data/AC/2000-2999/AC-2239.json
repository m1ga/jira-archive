		"description": "I have been trying to publish an update to an old app.  I initially built the update with Titanium 2.1.2, Xcode 4.3 and ios SDK 5.1.\r\n\r\nWhen I submitted the app I received feedback from Apple that the app crashed on IOS6.  \r\n\r\nTo rectify that problem I installed Xcode 4.5 and the current build of Titanium 2.1.3.  When I compiled and submitted the app it failed the automatic validation check giving the following message:\r\n\r\n\"iPhone/iPod Touch: application executable is missing a required architechture.  At least one of the following architechture(s) must be present:armv6\"\r\n\r\nI looked at the Q&A and found a suggested modification to the info.plist file to sort that out.  When I next submitted the app I then got another error from the automatic validation process:\r\n\r\n\"This bundle is invalid.  The key UIRequiredDeviceCapabilities in the Info.plist may not contain values that would prevent this application from running on devices that were supported by previous versions.\"\r\n\r\nI then realised that ios 6 only supports armv7 so is no use for updating an existing app that has been published to armv6 devices.\r\n\r\nI have downloaded Xcode 4.3 and copied the ios 5.1 SDK to the my Xcode 4.5 installation and installed the iPhone 5.1 simulator.\r\n\r\nI then tried to build my app with Titanium 2.1.3 and ios SDK 5.1.  The packaging failed with the following error in builder.py:\r\n\r\n~~~\r\n[ERROR] /Users/des/Apps/iLoyalty/build/iphone/Classes/TiApp.mm:627:12: error: cannot initialize return object of type 'NSUInteger' (aka 'unsigned int') with an rvalue of type 'id'\r\n[ERROR] \r\n[ERROR] Error: Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/Users/des/Library/Application Support/Titanium/mobilesdk/osx/2.1.3.v20120921190208/iphone/builder.py\", line 1315, in main\r\n    execute_xcode(\"iphonesimulator%s\" % link_version,[\"GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS=__LOG__ID__=%s DEPLOYTYPE=development TI_DEVELOPMENT=1 DEBUG=1 TI_VERSION=%s %s %s\" % (log_id,sdk_version,debugstr,kroll_coverage)],False)\r\n  File \"/Users/des/Library/Application Support/Titanium/mobilesdk/osx/2.1.3.v20120921190208/iphone/builder.py\", line 1221, in execute_xcode\r\n    output = run.run(args,False,False,o)\r\n  File \"/Users/des/Library/Application Support/Titanium/mobilesdk/osx/2.1.3.v20120921190208/iphone/run.py\", line 41, in run\r\n    sys.exit(rc)\r\nSystemExit: 65\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nI appreciated that 2.1.3 is a work in progress at the moment, but supporting SDK 5.1 in order to maintain existing app will be necessary.\r\n\r\n",
