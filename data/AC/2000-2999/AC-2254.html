   I follow the same steps as you have mentioned but not able to reproduce the error. My studio built is 3.2.0 GA.
   
   Prefreneces  ==> Studio ==>  Overall theme  ==> editor theme ==> cobalt
   
   Apply and restart the studio and I see the cobalt theme.
   
   Please let me know what am I missing.

   Ritu,
   I have no idea what to tell you. I just recreated the issue again. Dark Studio/Cobalt. Close/Restart. Overall theme reverts to Mac, Editor theme reverts to Eclipse. So, I tried a third time with Django. Close/Restart. This time the correct theme reloaded. Switched back to Cobalt. Close/Restart. Cobalt still displays. This is driving me crazy.
   
   It's just one of quite a few problems I'm having with release 3.2 right now. And they are costing me greatly in lost productivity and sanity.</li>

   It appears that you are able to set the theme correctly now. Let us know if you run into this issue again and we would try to diagnose this issue further as we have not been able to reproduce this issue on multiple machines.
   
   Please file JIRA tickets for other issues you are running into and we would take a look at them at a priority. Please note that we are going to release 3.2.1 shortly that would fix most of the issues with 3.2.0 release.</li>
