<h3>Description</h3>


- create an Alloy project
- add an image to the app/assets/images folder with name "Test.png"
- create an ImageView and reference the image with "/images/test.png"
  Note the upper/lower-case difference
- build and run on Android emulator

observe that the image is not found/displayed

- right-click the image in the app/assets/images folder and rename it properly to "test.png" with lower-case "t"
- clean the build
- notice that the Resources folder is not removed
- build and run on Android emulator

observe that the image is still not found/displayed


Solution
- delete the Resources folder in addition to cleaning the build

Expected that cleaning the build would ensure that files are properly updated.

Seems to work properly when the filenames differ in more than lower/uppercase writing.

   This is invalid. iOS and Android are case sensitive. </li>

   I am not sure why this is invalid. The problem is that a clean build does not seem to copy a resource to the resources folder when it's upper/lower-case spelling has changed. It maybe filed at the wrong place, as it is a Titanium Studio problem.</li>
