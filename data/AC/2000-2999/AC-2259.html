   [~underlabs] Can you add the build file as noted in /Users/theUser/Documents/Titanium/AppName/build.log?</li>
<li>Joseph Sachs 2013-05-29

   Attached the build.log I wish I can provide more info, but this is all that was traced. I can probably _securely_ send you the full project?</li>
<li>Daniel Sefton 2013-05-29

   Hi Joseph,
   
   Yeah that doesn't provide much more info sadly :)
   
   That's also what you see when you go to Help -> Studio -> View Log File?
   
   Does it only happen for that particular project?
   
   You mention Admob - what happens if you remove that?
   
   Note that the Admob module is open source, so you could always try rebuilding it yourself: <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_modules/tree/master/admob" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_modules/tree/master/admob</a></li>

   Hi Daniel,
   
   I've removed AdMob, and I still got the same error. I also attached the logfile from Help -> Studio -> View Log File.</li>
<li>Daniel Sefton 2013-05-30

   Thanks Joseph. The log is really long, it would help even more if you could go to Help -> Studio -> Clear Log File, try building again, and then posting that log too. Then we can know exactly which error is relevant.
   
   One other thing - can you clarify if it happens for other projects? What happens if you try to build one of the template projects?
   
   Cheers!</li>

   That was exactly what I was trying to do :)
   
   I've uploaded the essential session. On another note, an empty project/other projects, work.
   
   Notify me (seeing the log dosen't help too much) if you would like me to email you the Project itself as is. It runs perfectly on iOS... Now the Android version is next, and I'd prefer to have the same code base, and manage the platform differences by code. 
   
   This error occurred on the first run of trying it on Android (the device & simulator gives this error). Also, I have tried removing All Modules.
   
   I wouldn't have logged this error in Jira till I saw this: <a href="http://developer.appcelerator.com/question/151834/build-process-exited-with-code-1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://developer.appcelerator.com/question/151834/build-process-exited-with-code-1</a> 
   This was first asked 4 weeks ago. I also tried to target Android 2.3.3 to 4.0 with the same error.</li>
<li>Daniel Sefton 2013-05-31

   Just ran your project - first on iOS 6 simulator, ran fine. I then installed it on a Samsung Galaxy S2 Android 2.3.6, it installed and ran fine without any error for both 3.1 GA and latest 3.1.1 build (however the screen is all white, but that's probably a porting issue you've yet to solve). I then built it for the Android 4.1.2 x86 HVGA emulator, and the project built fine, but crashed at runtime.
   
   Sadly I can't reproduce your "Build process exited with code 1" error...</li>
<li>Joseph Sachs 2013-05-31

   I guess that's Good news :)
   
   No problem with the porting issue, I'd love to start working on it.
   
   I've copied all the resource/ folder into a New Project, and it gave me an error:
   <code><pre>
   [ERROR] Error generating R.java from manifest
   [ERROR] /Users/theFool/Documents/Titanium/BikeWatchAndroid/build/android/AndroidManifest.xml:13: error: Error: String types not allowed (at 'configChanges' with value 'keyboard|keyboardHidden|orientation|screenLayout|uiMode|screenSize|smallestScreenSize').
   [ERROR] :  Build process exited with code 1
   [ERROR] :  Project failed to build after 2s 291ms
   </pre></code>
   
   So now I'm figuring it's the tiapp.xml's *<android>* tag that's causing the trouble.
   
   With a bit of research... seems it's AdMob that needs:
   <code><pre>
   &lt;manifest android:versionCode="1" android:versionName="1.0"/&gt;
   &lt;uses-sdk android:maxSdkVersion="16" android:minSdkVersion="8" android:targetSdkVersion="16" /&gt;
   &lt;tool-api-level&gt;16&lt;/tool-api-level&gt;
   </pre></code>
   And it WORKED!!
   
   Sorry to have bothered you. I think this issue should be changed to resolved.</li>
<li>Daniel Sefton 2013-05-31

   Could be, I'm using the latest stable: 3.1.0.201304151600</li>
<li>Joseph Sachs 2013-05-31

    It's Working now :)</li>
<li>Daniel Sefton 2013-05-31

    I forgot about the studio version, I guess I'll try with 3.1.1 next.</li>
<li>Daniel Sefton 2013-05-31

    Oh, ok. Nice. Glad you solved it :-) I'll resolve the issue.
    
    Thanks!</li>
<li>Shak Hossain 2013-12-10

    Closing as per Joseph's feedback.</li>
