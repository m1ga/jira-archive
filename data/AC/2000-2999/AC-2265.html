<h3>Description</h3>

We have purchased a module from the appcelerator market.
<module version="1.0.1">com.logicallabs.inappproducts</module>

We installed the module globally for all apps.

We include the module in 1 app and it works fine.

We then create a new app, empty project template, include the module and start the app. Then we receive the dreaded:

"License violation detected. Unlicensed module(s) detected.  You must be a subscriber to use one or more of the modules included with this project.. Please contact Appcelerator Support."

Everything is done with 1 single user account at appcelerator, 1 installation of titanium on the same computer.

Something is VERY FISHY with the license validation... And we're getting really annoyed we cannot use the modules we have paid for, and the appcelerator support is nearly NON-EXISTING, we get no response whatsoever to our mails. Ever heard or some sort of support ticket system!?

Anwyays, this issue is all over the net when googling it. Please fix your validation!

   We are sorry that you are having an issue with module verification. Please provide us your user id and email address and we would troubleshoot the issue.</li>

   1 seat license means we can use it for more than 1 app right? With the same titanium account/user.</li>
<li>Emil 2014-01-15

   Is there anyway for us to debug the license validation? So we can get more info on what is causing it?
   
   See what data we are sending for the validation for example?</li>

   Perhaps this has something to do with how our apps are made in our appcelerator account.
   
   Looking at the list at <a href="https://my.appcelerator.com/apps" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://my.appcelerator.com/apps</a> with "All apps" selected we see lots of our older apps having the "titanium" icon infront of them. (These apps are also cloud enabled btw). In these old apps, the module validation seems to work.
   
   In the new app we have created, the icon infront of them in the list is a cloud icon. For these apps, the license validation seems to fail for the purchased modules...  What does this icon infront of the apps mean anyways and why is it different for the apps we have? They are all cloud enabled created within titanium studio.
   
   Just an observation...
   
   In fact, for the app that is causing the validation errors, just changing the guid to another old app we have (with the titanium icon in the list) it works without any errors. So it seems new apps that we create somehow gets buggy in our appcelerator account?</li>
