<h3>Description</h3>

I am trying to develop Titanium mobile application with Android SDK.

Previously I am using Android version 2.3.7 on my Sony Xperia U. 

Recently I upgrade my OS to 4.0.4 and observed that none of titanium application runs. It gets crashed immediately after Splash screen -> app.js 

I have tried the same with Sony's Xperia Model Tipo and observed same problem .

I have tested my application on Android SDK 4.0.4 running on devices like Samsung's S duos, LG's Optimus and Micormax Canvas .

   Hello,
   
   did you modified the settings for developers? If you set the automatic kill of activities, is the behavior that you should see.
   
   i.e., go to Settings -> Developer Options in your device and make sure that the option "Don't keep activities" is off. 
   
   Best,
