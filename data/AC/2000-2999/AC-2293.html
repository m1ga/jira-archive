<h3>Description</h3>

Hi, I made a background running application for iphone using titanium location services and it is working fine. But the problem is if I turn off the iphone and turn it on again the location service is no more running. I need to open the application upon every restart of iphone to make the application to start run in background again.

Please, its urgent!

   Hi Andres,
   
   This is native behavior of the iOS platform, you can't change the fact that apps need to be re-opened to re-initiate services on restart.
   
   Closing as invalid.</li>
