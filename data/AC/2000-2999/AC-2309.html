<h3>Description</h3>

When loading a mapview in the mobile web environment using 2.1.3GA the map doesnt load correctly to the dimensions I give it. I have to go through a login screen to get to my mapview so I dont get a chance to reload the screen a bunch of times, but if I did after about 4 reloads it corrects its self. I tried connecting a 'complete' listener to the view but in mobile web that event is never fired. Any word when this will be corrected?

   Please could you put together a simple test case for this? Thanks!</li>

   I disabled authentication, it only happens every once and a while but still is very frequent. <a href="http://dev.andrewapperley.ca/Packaged/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://dev.andrewapperley.ca/Packaged/</a> , if you want to see the code I use to generate it send me an email at mail@andrewapperley.ca and ill send you the package.</li>

   That does look quite messed up. Are you sure this can't be narrowed down and turned into a test case? Either way some code needs to make it on this report before I can move it to TiMob. Cheers.</li>

   I've set this to resolved so that the issue can now be edited to provide more info.
   Thanks,
