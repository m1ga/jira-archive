   Hello Matej,
   
   I am seeing the same behavior in the release candidate of Ti Studio 3.2.0.201311262027.
   However, I do not see  this with the latest release candidate Ti Studio 3.2.0.201312031529.
   
   This may have been corrected.
   Could you please try updating and verify if you still have the same issue?

   Hi Eric,
   
   Sorry I didn't noticed that there is newer version of Studio. I have updated and it does work. Thank you very much</li>

   Matej,
   
   No worries. Things move quickly here and there is always another version in the works.
   Glad we were able to get your issue resolved. I will close this ticket as fixed.</li>
