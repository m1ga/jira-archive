<h3>Description</h3>

Hey guys,

I imported the kitchen sink in an attempt to continue learning app development, but it absolutely won't run on Android for me. I tried directly off of my Galaxy Tab 10.1 but the same thing happens.

The log file doesn't display much either...
bq. [INFO] :   Running emulator process: python "/Users/OConnor/Library/Application Support/Titanium/mobilesdk/osx/3.1.3.GA/android/builder.py" "emulator" "KitchenSink" "/Users/OConnor/Downloads" "/Users/OConnor/Documents/Titanium_Studio_Workspace/Kitchen Sink" "com.appcelerator.kitchensink" "1" "HVGA" "armeabi"
