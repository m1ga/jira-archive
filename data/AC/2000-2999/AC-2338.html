When an exception is raised in my app i now get this

   Martin, can you please attach a test case we can use to replicate the issue?</li>

   Actually i have difficulties pointing out what line of code causes it.
   I am still having it right now on my device. 
   The problem is that it doesnt crash so i dont really know
   But clearly looking at the code, the declaration is missing!</li>

   Hi Martin,
   Can you test the latest version of master to see if this is still an issue?
   Cheers.</li>

   I had it fixed on my branch so cant really tell.
   But what i can say is that there is no more mention of "exceptionMessage" in the iphone .m and .h files of the master branch
   So i think it has been fixed yes.</li>

   Ok thanks, let us know if it reoccurs. Closing as fixed for now.</li>
