<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Steps to Reproduce</h4>
Create a window with google map and don't forget to put the google map api key for release in your tiapp.xml.
Create an debug apk.

I discovered this bug just after update titanium studio 3.2, CLI, 3.2 and SDK 3.2.1.
I have an application who worked under SDK 3.1.3 but after update CLI 3.2, i doesn't work anymore.No change in the code, simply an update of Studio and CLI.

Lot lot lot of peaple have this probleme, check google to see how many people have this bug.


<h4>Actual Result</h4>
[Error] The Google Play services resources were not found. Check your project configuration to ensure that the resources are included.
Authentification failure with the key : XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

Because on debug mode, Titanium use the api key for release to connect google map instead of use the private certificat in the SDK.

<h4>Expected Result</h4>
Authentification success on Google Map
