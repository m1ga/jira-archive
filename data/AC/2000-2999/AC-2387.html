<h3>Description</h3>

When I fill all the fields in "New Mobile Project" window and click the finish button titanium studio crashed very often. The loading finishes and just when the window should close the entire app freezes and I have to force quite. I'm creating default alloy projects.

I have attached a log after re-opening from one of such crash.

   Hmm, it's sort of hard to know which error in that log is the problem. Did you clear the log beforehand?
   
   Please could you also attach your diagnostic log? (Found at Help -> Studio -> Run Diagnostic Test)
   
   Thanks.</li>

   Hi levani,
   
   I'm not sure if the errors in the log are related to the crash, but as stated in TISTUD-2218, the password errors have been fixed for Studio 3.1.2. It might be worth trying the nightly from <a href="http://preview.appcelerator.com/studio/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://preview.appcelerator.com/studio/</a></li>

   Hello Levani,
   
   Can you please confirm that you have tested using Studio 3.1.2 and whether or not you still are experiencing this issue?
   
   Thanks,

   Updated Studio to version 3.1.3 and created several test projects. Everything seem to be OK now.</li>
