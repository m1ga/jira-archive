   Hi,
   
   Unfortunately this isn't a valid bug report -- we need a lot more information; most importantly we need a complete but simple reproducible test case that we can drop into an app.js and run. See this link about submitting bug reports: <a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#</a>!/guide/How_to_Submit_a_Bug_Report
   
   I saw that you have some code in the Q&A question, but that's not enough - make sure it runs standalone in an app.js and then update this issue.
   
   Also, the Android version you're using would be useful.
   
   Thanks!</li>
