   Was just able to replicate with 3.0.0.v20121106114610 on Galaxy S3</li>

   Hi Jerod,
   
   I just re-tested it with S3 and the sample test case provided in the jira ticket with 3.0.0.v20121106114610 build. The image orientation is proper after taking a pic from camera. Please let me know if you are using a different test case or doing differently. If not, could you please test it on another device?

   I see the autorotate:true does allow the exif data to be read for the imageview, but in our use case we're need to do some image manipulation and then save the file to storage without attaching the image to the display.
   
   1. Take a photo
   2. Create thumbnail of photo and save
   3. Attach overlay to photo cropped to certain dimensions and save that photo</li>

   If you can provide me a simple test case of what you are doing, I shall test it and re-open the Jira if necessary.

   Is there a way to read EXIF data to determine orientation of photo in the success callback function of the event.media ?</li>

   The toImage() call on android was causing consistent crashing but this seems to have done the trick:
   
   <code><pre>
         var imageFile = event.media;     
         var imageAsTaken = Ti.UI.createImageView({
           image : imageFile,
           autorotate : true
         });
         if (!ui.isAndroid()) {
           imageFile = imageAsTaken.toImage();
         } else {
           imageFile = imageAsTaken.toBlob();
         }
   </pre></code></li>

   Cool. Good to know about it. Please follow it up on the other ticket ( exif data ). Can i close the ticket if you dont have any further questions?
