<h3>Description</h3>

At some point during a build for iOS the appicon.png file in Resources is being overwritten with the default Ti logo appicon.png.  Saw this happen before with Ti Studio 3.00 but then it was fixed.

Just ran a simple test and built for iOS Simulator and my appicon.png was overwritten.

   It appears that if you put an appicon.png in Resources/iphone, then it is no longer overwritten with the default.  
   
   This is annoying because it is change to the previous behavior and in my view violates a rule of development environments not to overwrite supplied info without consent.</li>

   Hi Joe,
   
   Can you please provide the test case that shows this issue so that I may verify the bug? 
   
   Thank you,

   1. create default Ti classic project in 3.02 Studio
   2. remove appicon.png from Resources/iphone
   2. put appicon.png in Resources that is different from the default Ti logo appicon.png file
   3. build for iPhone simulator
   
   That's it.  The reason why you haven't seen it in regression testing is because you probably don't test with appicons other than the Ti logo default.
   
   From what I can tell, Ti Studio does not see an appicon.png file in Resources/iphone so it assumes that there isn't one (always a really bad idea to assume stuff).
   Then it makes the second mistake of overwriting whatever appicon.png file may be in Resources with the default Ti logo appicon.png file.  
   Given that there are very few (maybe zero) situations where you would actually want to use the default Ti logo appicon.png file, this is kind of a crazy thing to do.
   
   The fix is to put a copy of your desired appicon.png file in Resources/iphone - but this is kind of weird anyway given that you need to put all the other appicon*.png files (ilke appicon@2x.png, etc) in Resources.</li>

   I do not think that your icon files should be in the Resources folder, they should be located within Resources/iphone and Resources/android respectively. This is how the icons should be located for all projects because this is the auto path that an app looks in when it tries to find the icon. In your last sentence: 
   
   "but this is kind of weird anyway given that you need to put all the other appicon*.png files (ilke appicon@2x.png, etc) in Resources." 
   
   I do not find this to be the case. For all projects, icons such as appicon@2x.png are also located in Resources/iphone and Resources/android.</li>

   Then I would suggest that you change the Ti 3.0 documentation
   [<a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/3.0/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/3.0/#</a>!/guide/Icons_and_Splash_Screens-section-29004897_IconsandSplashScreens-iOSgraphicassetrequirementsandoptions]
   which currently states that appicons can be in either Resources or Resources/iphone.
   
   Regardless, this is a change from the previous behavior and I don't understand why it was necessary to change from the previous behavior - but I'll go ahead and change my dozen apps.</li>

   Joe, let me ask engineering if this was a deliberate change or a possible mistake, I'll look into it more and get back to you. Sorry for the inconvenience. </li>

   Joe, 
   
   I have done a bit of testing over that past day or so and I cant seem to replicate the part where the appicon.png is overwritten with the default Titanium appicon.png. The icon just shows up blank on the homescreen when I put a different appicon.png in the Resources folder. Could you post some screenshots that shows the behavior you described?
   
   Thanks,
   
   Carter</li>
