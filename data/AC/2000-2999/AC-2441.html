<h3>Description</h3>

Sound is playing only with ExternalStorageDirectory in Android. We are not able to play sound using ApplicationDataDirectory.

To mitigate this, we used 'URL' of Ti.Media.Sound. This is showing inconsistent behaviour on HTC devices where the audio is played properly but the control is also going to 'error' event of Sound.
