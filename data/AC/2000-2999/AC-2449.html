   Hi Keylo,
   
   Can you please send me your user id ,app GUID and a few of the objects that you are trying to remove by email at info@appcelerator.com? I will look into this immediately.

   Hi,
   
   I have the same problem. Custom objects created with one cloud user that no longer exists are impossible to delete "Failed to authenticate user".
   Is there a way to change that ?</li>

   Thanks for reporting this issue. I can reproduce it when I try to delete a Custom Object that is associated with a user that has already been deleted. Note that this issue does not occur if the user exists. A work around would be to delete all the objects associated with a user before deleting the user object.
   
   Steps to reproduce the issue
   ----------------------------
   1. Login to cloud.appcelerator.com 
   2. Create an ACS application
   3. Create a User object 
   4. Create any two custom objects with User set to the user created in step #3
   5. Delete one of these two custom objects and it is successful
   6. Delete the user created in step 3
   7. Delete the remaining custom object and it throws an error "Failed to authenticate user"
   
   I have reported this issue to engineering as part of CLOUDSRV-3047 ticket.
