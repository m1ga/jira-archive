itemclick will fire when not in editing mode for listView. As soon as editing mode is enabled event listener ignores clicks.

allowsSelectionDuringEditing: true ... does not help to alleviate the issue

   itemclick won't fire in editing mode.
   
   alternatively you can use the event callback in a template, but for some strange reason, some rows won't fire the listener. when I re-run simulator it is a different set of rows that won't fire. usually there are two rows that won't fire click event. i'm using sections.</li>
