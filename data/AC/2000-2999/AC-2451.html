<h3>Description</h3>

UrbanAirship doesn't launch app when notification is clicked. To see this issue, create project with UA module, configure it for push notification and then send notification while app is in the background. Then, click on notification. App should start after that, but it doesn't.

   Thanks for bring this up to our attention, Ivan.
   
   Does the problem happen on latest UA module? Is there a chance to get device logs? Then this report would be complete according [JIRA Ticket Checklist](<a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#</a>!/guide/How_to_Submit_a_Bug_Report-section-29004732_HowtoSubmitaBugReport-JIRATicketChecklist) in order to move it to main project.</li>

   Ivan,
   
   Closing this since we have not heard back from you in a while. However, if this is still an issue, I would be happy to revisit if you can provide the additional details requested by Eduardo.
   
   Thanks,</li>
