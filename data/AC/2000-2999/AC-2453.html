   Hello Mario,
   
   Sorry for the inconvenience. Can you please let me know what steps you have tried to fix this? Have you tried reinstalling studio? Was it working before and stopped working at a certain time? Was it after an update? More information is needed to determine the cause and possible fix to the problem.
   
   Thank you,
   
   Carter</li>

   We have not heard back from you since you posted the issue. Not sure if the studio is still throwing when trying to load it. If so, please send us details so that we can take next necessary step to fix. Since this is a very likely installation issue, we will mark it as invalid bug. </li>
</ol>
