   Please let us know the exact KitchenSink test you are running to reproduce this issue. It would also be helpful if you can describe the expected and actual behavior.</li>

   hi, the test is the Camera Overlay, the aspect ratio is wrong with iphone 5, i think is more correct to choose the top margin of the view and maintain the correct aspect ratio </li>

   We tested Kitchen Sink for Camera Overlay functionality and we could not reproduce the issue. Would it be possible for you to post a video of the issue so that we can make sure that we are trying to reproduce the same issue?</li>

   Resolving this ticket as we cannot reproduce this issue and the reporter has not followed up.</li>
