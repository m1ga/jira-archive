<h3>Description</h3>

*Problem*
If there is a symlink in the Resources directory to another directory in the filesystem, the project will not deploy to iOS devices (build fails). Same project runs correctly in the iOS simulator and on Android devices.

The reason for doing this is to include common resources from elsewhere without having to duplicate them - for example images. The bug occurs even if the directory linked to is empty. Error as below, persists even if build dir deleted and project cleaned. Builds correctly as soon as symlink deleted.

*Log*
<code><pre>[ERROR] :  ** BUILD FAILED **
[ERROR] :  The following build commands failed:

   Cannot reproduce with Ti SDK 3.1.1 GA or 3.2 CI.
   
   I can reproduce it with 3.1.0 GA however. Please update your SDK and be sure to include your SDK version in future.
   
   Thanks.</li>

   Thank you, I will be sure to include SDK version in future. The project is using 3.1.0 GA so I will try updating the SDK to 3.1.1 GA. Will let you know if issue persists.
   
   Best,
