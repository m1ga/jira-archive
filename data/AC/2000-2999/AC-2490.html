   Hi Hugh,
   
   Are you still having this issue? Can you try updating to the latest Studio build? (e.g. 3.1.1.201306112235)
   
   Personally I'm not seeing this issue.</li>

   Someone over at TISTUD-3064 said the following:

   I had the same problem. It started happening after I changed my password for my iTunes account. Here is why.
   
   The Studio appears to connect to developer.apple.com using the xCode Organizer. If you open xCode, then Organizer, it remembers the password you last entered for you itunes account. This explains partially why doing browse and selecting a new provisionning profile doesn't stick. The studio really want so keep in sync with you Apple Developer account. Even when you add one, it will be crushed by the cached list of profiles in your xCode organizer.
   
   Fixing this is simple. Open xCode, open the Organizer. Most likely it will prompt you for your new password. Bottom right, hit refresh. The list of profiles from your Apple account will come through. Now go back in the Studion -> Preferences -> Provisioning Profiles. Hit refresh, you'll get the same list as in your Organizer.{quote}
   
   Not sure if it helps this issue.</li>
