   Is the project created correctly after this?</li>
<li>Soumya Kanti Kar 2013-07-31

   Yes the project gets created properly. But this happens when trying to install the application on the device. What I have observed is that, during this process, if I launch Task Manager and end the process node.exe, then the window gets closed and the application gets installed properly. Thought to update this information incase it helps anyone. No issues on build process if node.exe process is killed.</li>

   What I have observed is that during this process of waiting, if we kill node.exe process from Task Manager then this progress dialog gets closed and we do not have to wait. Not sure about the reason but killing node.exe process makes no harm. May be as I am behind a proxy, this issue is occuring. Just thought of updating this in the tracker for future use.</li>

   Tested with latest Ti Studio 3.1.3, works fine.</li>
