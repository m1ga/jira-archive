<h3>Description</h3>

Steps to reproduce:

1. Create a new application with the attached files
2. Launch the application
3. Tap "open window"
4. Tap the "Row 1" label in the resulting window
    *You should see one alert saying "click[object TiUiLabel]"
5. Tap the "back" button
6. Tap "open window" button again
7. Tap the "Row 1" label
    *You'll now see two identical alerts saying "click[object TiUiLabel]"

Expected Behavior:
    *Label should only fire click event once

Actual Behavior:
    *Label fires click event twice on second opening of the window

Notes:
    *The is severe because it can cause errors with window navigation. For example, if clicking the label is supposed to open a window, the open event is fired twice in rapid succession. When the user then closes the window, two close events on the same window are called and the result will be a black screen that can only be escaped by force quitting the application. This is a blocking issue for our app and many users have reported this error.
    *This is a regression in Ti 3.0+. The same test case in 2.1.4 produces the expected behavior

   Tested with 3.1.0 click event was only firing once when following repro steps.</li>
<li>Michael Belkin 2013-04-11

   Were you able to verify this issue in 3.0 to confirm it was resolved in 3.1?</li>
