   Is this still an issue for you?</li>

   We had uncovered and fixed an issue with our push service that caused multiple push notifications to be sent to the same device in a specific scenario. It was around the same time as your screenshot indicates. 
   
   Please let us know if you encounter this issue again and we would be happy to look into it further.</li>

   It seems to be fixed currently. Thank you.</li>
