<h3>Description</h3>

I know than on Ios7 it is no longer possible to add a location event in a background service. I had an app working this way on ios6. This would not be an issue if location event worked like android, meaning that even though event listener is added on foreground, it is still triggered while on background.But this is not happening with titanium on ios7, when app is on background no location event triggered either on foreground or background code. This makes it impossible to track location data while on the background. If this could work i could implement a solution like the following for Ios:

I know this is not the best approach but would at least be a solution.
