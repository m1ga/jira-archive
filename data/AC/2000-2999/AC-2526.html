<h3>Description</h3>

I tried to call a jquery.js file in a html file which is also called in a webview ... when testing it on simulator everything works fine, but it wasn't the same result on the device

sample : 
<script src="../scripts/jquery.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

tested with iPhone 4, iOS 6 and Ti SDK 3.0.0 GA

Note : the same code works with SDK 2.1.4 GA. Problem only in iphone when installing on physical device - Ti SDK 3.0.0.GA

   Please provide more information. I need an app.js, the HTML file, and the js file used in the sample app. Also provide steps to reproduce, what to expect and what actually happens</li>

   We have not heard back from you since you posted the issue. Not sure if this is still showing the similar behavior on physical device. If so, please send us a test case as we requested some time ago so that we can take next necessary step to fix. </li>
