<h3>Description</h3>

I am trying to use ti build to build test APKs via continuous integration/Jenkins. I am using this incantation:

<code><pre>ti build -p android --target device --build-only --android-sdk=/Library/Frameworks/Android/android-sdk</pre></code>

The tool builds an apk which is good. But the problem is that after it finishes building, it tries to install/launch the application and the process hangs. Sometimes I get lucky and the adb process times-out. But other times it hangs forever which is bad for an automated build machine.

<code><pre>
[32m[INFO] [39m:   Launching application on device: [36m/Library/Frameworks/Android/android-sdk/platform-tools/adb "-d" "shell" "am" "start" "-a" "android.intent.action.MAIN" "-c" "android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" "-n" "com.foo.mobile.got/.GotActivity" "-f" "0x10200000"[39m
* daemon not running. starting it now on port 5037 *
* daemon started successfully *
[31m[ERROR] [39m: [31m Install app failed with exit code 255
[39m
</pre></code>

When using the build-only switch, I expect that I don't need to have a device plugged in and it won't try to install/run on a device.

   Hi Eric,
   
   I'm going to close this as duplicate of TIMOB-12034 and TIMOB-12745. Please watch those issues instead. I'll bump TIMOB-12034 at least to see if there's any update.
   
   Thanks.</li>
