<h3>Description</h3>

We are unable to provide the source code as it is client code and we cannot share it. But will try to share the issue that we are facing with the abort call in Android.

We login into our application by providing an username and password.
We download a file using HTTPClient
After sometime we call httpClient.abort()
We again try to download the file again.
We get 401 response from the server.

This happens in Android only but works fine in iOS. Can someone from the Appcelerator team give some light on this.

   Looks like you need to set the headers for authentication like below.
   xhr.setRequestHeader('property_name', 'property_value');
   
   If you can provide a sample reproducible test case, I can help. Otherwise pls look at KitchenSink examples.
