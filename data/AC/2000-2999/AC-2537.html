<h3>Description</h3>

*Problem*
Since i upgraded to 3.1.2 I have the following problem. In the emulator the app works as expected, however when I install the same project to a device it seems that it's not compiled in the same way. One day ago one of the controllers was still the same even if I cleaned, removed the build directory, removed the IPA from itunes, etc. I reinstalled and the emulator version works perfect but the installed app in the device only shows the splash screen and no error at all.

   Hi Carlos,
   
   We need a far more detailed description of your issue, I'm not sure I follow. Does it boil down to: Your app runs fine on the emulator, but when you install to the device, only the splash screen displays and nothing happens?
   
   We also need to be able to reproduce it on our end. So if you're not able to create a simple reproducible test case, we may need the project itself.
   
   Thanks!</li>
