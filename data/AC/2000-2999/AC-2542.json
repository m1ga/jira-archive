		"description": "h3. Steps to Reproduce\r\nI have spent a week installing Titanium and all dependencies (x86) on a win7 x64 laptop, and making sure the Android SDK's and all path variables are correct - as they appear to be in BFSDiag.txt. When Titanium starts it prompts to update to ACS 1.0.2, but always fails. I have scoured the blogs and FAQ's, tried changing Python path to internal Titanium Python path and various other workarounds and am lost. Have reinstalled nodejs, and checked everything again and again - and even reinstalled titanium and everything from scratch - nothing works. The Kitchen Sink test logically fails, I believe, because of the acs issue, however the error states \"unable to detect Android SDK targets\". Yet Titanium can detect the SDK targets and one blog concerning this being a bug in an earlier vers of Titanium and providing a workaround does not work. I would be grateful for any assistance at all and thanks for reading.\r\n\r\napologies for taking your time - this is now fixed. my system path of %SystemRoot%\\system32;%SystemRoot%;%SystemRoot%\\System32\\Wbem actually had c:\\ at the start of it. When removed, of course, the issues were fixed.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Result\r\nTitanium fails to upgrade ACS, and fails to run Kitchen Sink. \r\n\r\nh3. Expected Result\r\nACS upgrades and Kitchen sink runs",
