<h3>Description</h3>

Just realized this still exists.  It's been around forever, and I've had a workaround in place.  Out of curiosity I tried on 2.1.2 (or .3), and it's still an issue.

1.  If the local .html file contains a space in the name, such as "This File.html", then passing it as the url to Ti.UI.createWebView will NOT execute any JS files included by the file.

2.  If the local .html file does not contain a space, such as "ThisFile.html", then any JS included by the file is evaluated properly.

3.  This is Android; iOS works fine.
