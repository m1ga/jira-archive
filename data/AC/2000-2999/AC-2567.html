<h3>Description</h3>

Ever since updating to 3.1.3, I've noticed that when launching an app, the splash screen opens as normal, then briefly scales up, just as the index view is preparing to load.

The image scales up, from the bottom, cropping off the top 38px of the image.

I'm noticing this in iOS, on the iPhone. It even happens with the default, Appcelerator images.

   Hello Benjamin Allison,
   
   I have tested this issue in Ti SDK 3.1.3 GA. I canâ€™t reproduce this issue. Can you please add test case for this?
   
   Thanks</li>

   Bah, nevermind. I didn't realize my project was still using a beta of 3.1.3 and not the GA. Close!</li>

   Closing per updated remarks from Benjamin.</li>

   This problem has come back in Titanium 3.2.3.  To reproduce the problem:
   
   1) Build in Titanium
   2) Open project in xcode.
   3) Select 7.0 as the deployment target.
   3) Use asset catalogs and drag and drop 640x960 and 640x1136 splash screens.
   4) Delete the existing app on iphone.
   5) Build and run the app from xcode.
   
   Notice that the splash screen resizes on first launch as described in this bug.  Doesn't seem to happen on subsequent runs.  This could be due to caching.
   
   Should I open a new bug?
