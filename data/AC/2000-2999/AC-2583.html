<h3>Description</h3>

I was querying all events from my application using the following code

Cloud.Events.query({
	per_page: 1000
}, function(e){
	//Successfully queried all events
	if (e.success) {
		successCallback(e.events);
		
	} else {
		errorCallback(e);
	}
});

I found some events that were deleted from the cloud server earlier.

I went to the web side and checked my application details. I could search for the events. Please see the attached images. 

I was searching for the events using the user id '51c7311dcde8cd7360002217' which was already deleted(Picture 1). 

11 Events were displayed. All events were created by that particular user.

   CLOUDSRV is a private project so you cannot really track that ticket. I would update this ticket (TC-3471) based on the updates on that ticket for now.</li>
