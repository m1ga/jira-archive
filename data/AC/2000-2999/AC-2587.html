<h3>Description</h3>

I build my App Store releases using the CLI and every time I get the message "UI element scripting is not enabled" after Titanium wants to switch to Xcode.

You provide a fix for this using Titanium Studio, but I don't even use Titanium Studio, as these build are done automatically using a build server.

Is there a way to fix that? Or another App from the SDK folders I have to add manually?

It blocks the build for maybe a minute and then continues. But there are no issues caused by not having the UI scripting enabled.

   I'm marking this as a dupe of TISTUD-6192. While it's not 100% the same bug, it's related and when TISTUD-6192 is fixed, then this should be fixed too.</li>
