					"body": "Hello Jick,\n\nAfter doing some research on the subject, (since I haven't use JSS in a long time), I came across this post in the Q&A:\n\nhttp://developer.appcelerator.com/question/137015/how-does-jss-feature-really-works-in-titanium-mobile-sdk\n\nOne of the lead platform engineers says that we have not fully developed JSS and it have probably been removed from 3.0GA, this is why it is not working for you. \"The best way [to style your apps] is to use Alloy, the Titanium MVC framework, and create Titanium Stylesheets (tss) which are similar to jss files.\nIf you're too far down the road with your current app, you are probably better off writing helper functions that return the style settings.\"\n\nI will send an email to a platform engineer to confirm that JSS has been removed or is not supported anymore so that we know for the future. \n\nBest Regards,\nCarter\n\n",

					"body": "Thx for your response Carter. I appreciate this very much. We are already working on rewriting the app using Alloy. It will take about 3-4 months. This will be a totally new version of our app but we still need to support the earlier version (which is based on JSS) for about 6-12months. We tried to avoid using the 3+SDK but we will have to update once iOS7/Android 4.3 is out at the latest. As it is a \"large\" app we cannot simply rewrite the whole app to use Alloy. I don't want to blame as you guys are doing a great job. Luckily I can workaround the problem by deleting all Android JSS files when building for iPhone. As you said it would be at least great to know whether JSS is still fully supported in 3.+ or not. ",

					"body": "Jick,\n\nThere is another solution for you to use which is probably more recommended and would allow you to create styles for platform specific apps without using JSS. By using a style.js file you can declare default style properties for the UI components of your app. Take a look at the Tweetanium Source code here: \n\nhttps://github.com/appcelerator-titans/tweetanium/blob/master/mobile/Tweetanium/Resources/tweetanium/ui/styles.js\n\nYou can define default styles for your UI components this way until your alloy app is up and running. This is often called the Tweetanium Technique :D More info here:\n\nhttp://developer.appcelerator.com/question/144010/how-to-use-jss-correctly\n\nI hope this helps!\n\nCarter",
