   Hi Marvin,
   I think your CLI is not installed currently. Please install it currently. You just go to the help menu and click check for Titanium update if it now works, you just uninstalled the node.js and again click help menu and click check for Titanium update and install node and CLI then test your project.
   Thanks</li>

   Motiur, I don't quite understand what you mean. Isn't the CLI part of Titanium Studio? How do I install it? What I did: Update Titanium Studio, reinstall NodeJS, update Titanium Studio. Same error, now with "Titanium Command-Line Interface, CLI version 3.1.2, Titanium SDK version 3.1.1.GA"</li>

   Hi Marvin,
   
   When you click help > Check for Titanium Update you will see that node and CLI are installing. If that not occurs again uninstall node and try the same process until CLI installed currently and also installed Update titanium version 3.1.2.
   
   Thanks,  </li>

   Well, that's funny, cause when I uninstall node and try to update, I get an error which says that "node" could not be found.
   Anyway, why is this a CLI error? One should think that after (re)installing Titanium, the CLI should also be installed. Why would that be different by running the update?</li>

   Hi Marvin,
   
   It looks like one of Titanium's required components may be out of sync or failed to install correctly. Since your last update, are you still experiencing this issue?
   If so, could you please update to the latest Titanium version, 3.1.3.GA?
   That should update the needed components as well and get you back in working order.
   
   If it doesn't, we have other steps that we can take to force certain components to update/install.
   Thank you and let me know if you have any questions.</li>

   Thanks Eric. With the latest update it runs just fine.</li>
