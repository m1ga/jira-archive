<h3>Description</h3>

Posting issue where i see it fits best.

Suggest on creating jira project for appcelerator.com website. 

1. On my.appcelerator.com when signed in:
1.1. Bought a paid module with CreditCard. 
1.2. 'My account'  -> 'Payment History' doesnt show any payments.
1.3. The module is accesible in resources section for download..

2. 'My account' ->  'Manage payment method' doesn't work at all. Renders a big red default error message.

My questions are:
How do i download an invoice that i need for company's accounting?
Where can i find customer support? it seems that the site doesn't have any support at all in regards to website issues etc.

   Hi,
   
   JIRA is reserved for filing Titanium SDK, Studio, ACS bugs. You can send your request for invoice/payment related issues to info@appcelerator.com and we will get back to you ASAP. This page is public facing site and I don't recommend using this page for billing related discussion. I will close this ticket after I get you purchase details/email via email.
   
   Thanks
   Shak</li>
