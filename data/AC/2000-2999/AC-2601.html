<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Steps to Reproduce</h4>
Android configuration was previously valid according to Titanium SDK 3.1.3 but when I upgrade my SDK to 3.2.0, it is saying 'An Adnroid SDK is missing. Titanium requres Android platform 5.0'. However, I have configure the correct SDK path in platform preferences. And native Android development is working fine. 

Please resolve this issue ASAP. As some other developers also experienced this issue <a href="http://developer.appcelerator.com/question/160774/an-android-sdk-is-missing" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://developer.appcelerator.com/question/160774/an-android-sdk-is-missing</a>

<h4>Actual Result</h4>
Showing red cross mark on Android SDK

<h4>Expected Result</h4>
Should show green check mark on Android SDK

   Please confirm that you have upgraded Titanium Studio, CLI and SDK to 3.2.0 GA version. If you are running into this issue with Studio after upgrading all components to 3.2.0 GA release, please type the following command and attach the output. It would help us narrow down the problem.
   
   titanium info</li>

   With the update of titanium SDK, I also updated CLI but it did not fix this issue. 
   
   Resolution:
   ============
   I fixed this issue by uninstalling Titanium studio 3.1.3 in which SDK 2.1.2, 3.1.3 and 3.2.0 were installed and then download and reinstall updated version of Titanium studio 3.2.0 from appcelerator.com. And now it is working also for Android platform.
   
   
   PS : It would be great for other developers if concern department admits and work on this bug of Ti. </li>
