<h3>Description</h3>

I realised a few days ago that when building an apk on android, everything is visible just as it is in the project directory.
What it means is that anyone can take the apk, copy its content to a new project folder and simply copy your application!!!!
This is really bad.
I mean it s ok in some cases but most my client wouldn't like that at all!

This is a critical bug. A solution needs to be find very quickly

   I am sorry to bump this so quickly. But this is a critical problem. I have a lot of clients who would just refuse to use Titanium just because of this!</li>

   This only happens with 3.1.0 master? What about other (stable) TiSDK versions?</li>

   I just tested and i can confirm that it s the same on 2.1.4.GA
   You can create a simple project.
   Then build.
   Either look in the apk ->assets
   or in the build->android->bin->assets
   
   You can see your app.js in it.

   Ok, thanks. I'd like to pinpoint where this changed, was it working as expected before? What about 2.1.3 GA, or 2.1.2 GA?</li>

   Actually i discovered it recently. By that i mean that i never saw it working.
   I ll have to look at the builder.py but i dont remember seeing anything about compile js like i see in the ios builder.</li>

   I also tested and confirmed this on all SDK versions. However, I'm not sure if the same applies for the APK built for distribution. If you have android keystores to test this, it would help, if not I'll see if I can create a dummy keystore. Thanks.</li>

   Martin are you building to device/emulator or are you packaging. The .js file will be visible if you are building to device and emulator for test, but when you package the apk for distribution you should not see the .js file</li>

   Cannot reproduce when packaging app with 2.1.4.GA 3.0.0.CI or 3.1.0.master
   As Natalie pointed out, emulator/device builds contain js files mainly for development purposes such as debugging.</li>
<li>Martin Guillon 2012-11-29

   Wow, thanks a lot. Just tried with a keystore and i can confirm that it works.
   So i think we can close that bug. Sorry
   
   Yet i think it would be nice to be able to build in "distribution" mode without a keystore.
   The idea is that you can test the "compiled" js which can change a few things.
   
   Will look at it 
   
   Thanks</li>
