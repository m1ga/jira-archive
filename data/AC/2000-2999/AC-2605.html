<h3>Description</h3>

Frequently getting the 403 Aw Shucks page when trying to manage my apps at <a href="https://my.appcelerator.com/apps" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://my.appcelerator.com/apps</a>  
Seems to happen most often when the page has not finished fully loading and I click on a link.  Can also happen if I hit refresh before the page is done loading.
I can temporarily work around it by clearing cookies, waiting a few minutes, then logging back in. However it is difficult to get more than a few minutes in before getting the error.

   Hello,
   
   Which OS are you using? Does this happen in other browser? 
   
   Best,

   Windows 7 - 64.
   Also see the problem with Chrome 29.0.1547.65 on OSX 10.7.5 
   
   I tried to replicate in IE-10 on Win7-64 but was not able to.

   Tried with Chrome in Win 7, it's working. Looks like a temporal network hiccup. </li>
