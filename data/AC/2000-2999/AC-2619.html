<h3>Description</h3>

Push notifications to Android devices (possibly iOS as well) have stopped working since the beginning of this year, nothing changed in our code. We have tried sending via curl and from the web console, the messages show up under the push logs on the web interface and are listed as successful, however they are not coming through on any of the devices.

   Wayne,
   
   Not sure if you are using MQTT for push. If so, please read the details <a href="http://www.appcelerator.com/blog/2013/08/android-push-notification-deprecating-mqtt-in-favor-of-gcm/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.appcelerator.com/blog/2013/08/android-push-notification-deprecating-mqtt-in-favor-of-gcm/</a> about discontinuation of MQTT since the begining of the year.
   
   If this is not an MQTT issue, please post some additional details. You can send us the app GUID, ACS app ID by email at shossain@appcelerator.com and we will have a look into it ASAP.
   
   Thanks,</li>
