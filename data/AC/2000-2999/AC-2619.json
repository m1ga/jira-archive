If so, please read the details http://www.appcelerator.com/blog/2013/08/android-push-notification-deprecating-mqtt-in-favor-of-gcm/ about discontinuation of MQTT since the begining of the year.\n\nIf this is not an MQTT issue, please post some additional details. You can send us the app GUID, ACS app ID by email at shossain@appcelerator.com and we will have a look into it ASAP.\n\nThanks,",
