<h3>Description</h3>

We made Facebook like SNS using ACS. And the post was made with CustomObjects and also we used CustomObjects in Reviews for the post.

But when we try to browse the comments for the post which is made with CustomObjects in Reviews, there is only one post. How can I see all the reviews?

Please advise me.

   Can you please clarify what custom objects in review means? </li>

   As I emailed you, I can not see the data in Reviews. Please let me know if you need more info.</li>

   I believe your issue could come from the custom objects you are using for the posts and reviews not interacting the way you want them to.
   
   Is there a particular reason that you are not using the built in Post and Review objects?
   Instead of creating custom objects for your posts and your reviews, could you please consider creating actual Post and Review objects by clicking on the Post and Review links in the "Manage Data in <App Name>" on the "App Management" tab?
   
   These objects allow for custom_fields to be added to them, which should cover the fields you were trying to make in your custom objects.</li>

   Marking this "cannot reproduce". We have not heard back from the reporter in a while. If we don't hear back in a week, we will assume the issue is resolved and the ticket can be closed.</li>
