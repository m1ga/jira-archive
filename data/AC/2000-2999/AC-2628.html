   Hi,
   
   I am trying to launch my app on the IOS Simulator from Titanium Studio build 3.1.3.201309132423.
   I even tried to reset content from the IOS Simulator, but it still have the same problem. 
   
   What should I do to resolve this problem ? I need it to run in simulator for my development work, it just keeps on exiting without proper information. Are there any other logs I should provide ?
   
   Thanks</li>

   Thanks John for the support.
   
   Appcelerator, please double check your backward binary compatibility. Its ridiculous on how you guys manage your release leaving a lot of developers in the dark!</li>
