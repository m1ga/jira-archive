   Hi Mateusz,
   
   Please could you provide some more information? I'm not versed with ACS enough to know off by hand what you're trying to do, and our cloud team would appreciate a detailed issue. What is ACL? Can you list in detail the steps you go through to get to that error? What "Action" are you doing? A screenshot would also help.
   
   Thanks!</li>

   I attached screenshot, this should help ACS team. ACL stands for Access control list.</li>

   Hi Daniel, this should be duplicate of CLOUDSRV-1630. I'm going to take over from my team to fix this.</li>

   Since the CLOUDSRV ticket is private, I will leave this one open and update/close the ticket when CLOUDSRV-1630 is addressed.</li>

   Hi Mateusz,
   
   I believe the issue should now be fixed. If you could try again that would be great.
   
   Thanks.</li>
