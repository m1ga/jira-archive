   Did this used to work in iOS 6 or a previous version of the Titanium SDK? Is this possible natively with such a long piece of text?</li>
<li>Jason Kotchoff 2013-10-10

   Yep. Run the code on an iOS 6.1 or android simulator/device and it works fine.</li>
<li>Jason Kotchoff 2013-10-10

   However, i don't know whether it works on iOS7 if it's run in a native app (without titanium).</li>
<li>Mauro Parra-Miranda 2013-10-16

   Hello Jason,
   
   you should create a custom dialog to implement this, providing a scrollable view for all your text and two buttons as your image. 
   
   Check this code:
   
   <a href="https://developer.appcelerator.com/question/152503/creating-a-custom-dialog" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://developer.appcelerator.com/question/152503/creating-a-custom-dialog</a>
   
   In native, Apple expects you to create a custom UI element for that kind of usage.
   
   Best,

   Hi Mauro,
   
   That's exactly the technique I used as a workaround in the issue description (follow the gist link and view iOS7CompatibleTitaniumAlertDialog.js).
   
   This problem should not however, require a custom implementation.
   
   According to your API, a standard alert dialog should support this functionality:
   <a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#</a>!/api/Titanium.UI.AlertDialog
   
   As such, there is in fact a bug with the way a Titanium.UI.AlertDialog is rendering certain long strings. This may or may not be a bug with the underlying iOS API but it's definitely a bug.
   
   Regards,
   Jason</li>

   Invalid issue. </li>
