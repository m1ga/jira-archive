   Hi Mukul,
   
   Can you please provide the error log and the error that you are getting (probably a screenshot if possible)? Also, please post the exact commands you are typing in the terminal.
   
   Thanks,

   Hi Varun,
   
   This issue has been resolved. I should've commented earlier and closed it but apologies for that. 
   The requirement here is that ANDROID_SDK and ANDROID_NDK environment variables must be set before Titanium Android build will work. I believe because of legacy support, python scripts still rely on the ANDROID_SDK and ANDROID_NDK values.
   
   If you can improve the documentation, that would be great.
   
   Thanks,
   Mukul</li>

   Hi Mukul,
   
   I am glad it worked for you. Just a quick tip, if you run the command "titanium setup" command before running any other commands, it would take care of the general pre-configuration you need to have to begin using CLI.
   
   Thanks,
   Varun</li>

   You are absolutely right Varun. Just tried it out. 
   'ti setup' works like a charm. Should've done that in the first place.
   
   Thank you very much!!
