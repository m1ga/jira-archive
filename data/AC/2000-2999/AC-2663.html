   Hello Bert, Is this a bug or a new feature request? From my understanding, node.acs projects are usually created from the CLI. 
   Reference: <a href="http://nodeacs.cloud.appcelerator.com/guides/quickstart" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://nodeacs.cloud.appcelerator.com/guides/quickstart</a>
   If this is a new feature request, let me know and I will pass it along to engineering. If it is indeed a bug, can you provide documentation that "create new Node.ACS project" should be in the File menu? 
   Thank you,
   Carter</li>

   Carter -
   
   I thought this was a bug in Ti Studio. Your correct that they are normally created in CLI as the Node.ACS feature mentioned above is currently only available by installing a plugin from the Nightly Builds. This is called out in the documentation - but its not highlighted very well so i missed it.
   
   This can be closed as works as designed.

   This is not a bug - as this feature requires an additional plugin to the Ti Studio - while called out in the documentation, its not very prominent and I missed that at first.
