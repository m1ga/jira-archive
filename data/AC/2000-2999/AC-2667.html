<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Steps to Reproduce</h4>
Hi there, I am developing an mobile application for Android and iOS using appcelerator titanium alloy framework, code for the capture Video button is as follows: 

<code><pre>
//+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ $.captureVidBtn.addEventListener('click',function(e){ Ti.Media.showCamera({ success: function(event){ //// Ti.Media.saveToPhotoGallery(event.media); var sendit = Titanium.Network.createHTTPClient({ onerror:function(e){ //TI.API.debug(e.error); alert('There was an error durring connectiing with server...'); }, onload:function(e){ //TI.API.info('Received text: ' + this.responseText); response = this.responseText; alert(response);
        }   
    });
    sendit.open(&quot;POST&quot;,WEB_SERVICE_URL);
    var uploadParams    = ({&quot;mobile_form_action&quot;:&quot;upload_video&quot;,&quot;media&quot;:event.media,});
    sendit.send(uploadParams); 
      ////

},
animated:true,
autoHide:true,
saveToPhotoGallery:true,
showControls:true,
allowEditing:true,
mediaTypes:[Ti.Media.MEDIA_TYPE_VIDEO,Ti.Media.MEDIA_TYPE_PHOTO],
videoQuality:Ti.Media.QUALITY_640x480,
}); }); 
//+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 
</pre></code>

when I execute the application, the camera appears but it can take pictures only , the video mode is disabled :(,
Coding Environment: >> Macbook Pro, >> Titanium Studio 3.2.x >> Checking on Android Samsung Galaxy Young Device connected to mac machine
Please help
Thanks

<h4>Actual Result</h4>
Video button in start seems to be enabled but later it disabled

<h4>Expected Result</h4>
video and photo both should be able to get uploaded only photo is getting uploaded not video, we cannot even record the video

   Have you tried the kitchen sink application that comes with studio? If not, you can download it from studio.
   
   Run the kitchen sink app, go to Phone ==> Camera ==> Video record.
   
   The video works perfectly fine.
   
   Please let me know if you are looking for something else.</li>
