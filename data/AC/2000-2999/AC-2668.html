<h3>Description</h3>

We setup an appcelerator account awhile ago, but didn't activate it. After attempting to reset the password using the following url (<a href="https://my.appcelerator.com/auth/reset)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://my.appcelerator.com/auth/reset)</a>, I received this message: 

Your account has not been activated yet. An e-mail verification was just sent to you with a link to activate your account. Please make sure you check your SPAM folder, sometimes automated emails like this one can get incorrectly flagged as SPAM.

So far, I've received nothing in my inbox or spam folder. The email address it should have been sent to is hosted by GMail and has no spam filters applied.
