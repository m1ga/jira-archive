<h3>Description</h3>

Hi Team,

We have been developing a Android Tablet application in Titanium Studio.


* Titanium Studio android sdk version 1.8.2

We have developed this application using javascript and configured in Samsung Tablet (GT -P3100). 
Currently we are facing performance issue, we are using table view row it is hanging out when you continuosuly switch over from one tab to other.
We have checked all the script, everything seems fine. Can you please advise us, whether this cause because of any memory leakage issue?


Thanks in advance, Im looking for your advise to move forward.
Yusuf

   Hi syed,
   Since you are reporting a bug (the Q&A is for advice, not here), the requirement is to provide a reproducible test case for your problem. Without that, there's not much we can help you with. The other thing that concerns me is that you're using a really old SDK (1.8.2). I recommend that you upgrade to 2.1.4 GA and see if you continue to have problems.
   I will re-open once you have tested on a recent SDK and provided a test case.
   Thanks.</li>
