<h3>Description</h3>

The following error message seems to have started displaying in my project under development when pausing on breakpoints:

"An internal error occurred during: "child count update". 1"

This stops the variable panel from displaying its contents.

I'm aware that this may be down to a code issue within my project, but without any further information in the error message I can't really hunt down the problem.

   There is an old Q&A thread on the same topic and it suggests that having one of the variable with either binary or large data may cause this issue. Can you please check if that is the case with your scenario?

   Hi Ritu, thank you for your response and link. I do believe that this problem will be down to the number of variables we have in the global scope. I can't confirm this yet as we will require some refactoring in our application.</li>

   I am resolving this ticket as invalid for now as we don't have any information to diagnose this issue any further. But we would be happy to reopen the ticket once we have a simple runnable test case from you.</li>

   We have reduced the number of variables in global scope and the debugging window now works again. That you for your responses and help.</li>

   I am glad to hear that your application is working as expected.</li>
