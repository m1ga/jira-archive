<h3>Description</h3>

When using the dark keyboard (KEYBOARD_APPEARANCE_ALERT), and in general a dark UI, there's a very noticeable white flash when they keyboard is being dismissed (animated down). It looks as if the keyboard switches to the white style immediately when starting the animation. However it might also be a different glitch. Screenshot taken during dismissal attached.
