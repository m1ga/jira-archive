<h3>Description</h3>

I updated to SDK 3.2 for all the new features I need, and the best I can tell its impossible to have a facebook style slider with the new version. I am really disappointed with this..

basically I open my menu window... then I open another window on top of it, and I used to move the old top window out of the way, and then I could see the menu on the left. Now when I slide this new heavyweight out of the way all I see is black. I saw another thread where I could set the opacity to .5 for example and I can of course see my menu below it... but I can't click it because its not moving the whole window out of the way.

I now need to completely re architect my project. I spent a lot of time getting everything into alloy to have one codebase to find out that without using the old crappy window structure its impossible to have the same menu system with the new SDK. Extremely disappointed.

If an appcelerator dev wants my project I can email it.

The suggested solutions or using a Legacy Window or adding it to a view in every window are NOT ACCEPTABLE.  This needs to be resolved.
