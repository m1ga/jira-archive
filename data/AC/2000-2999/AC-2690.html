<h3>Description</h3>

Since this morning the API function to get the reviews from the ACS is not working well. It brings the same reviews for all the objects. It was working fine yesterday morning so it's not a code error. I receive error 500 as well

   Hi Ernesto,
   
   Thanks for the report. We made some system improvements yesterday and are in the process of fixing the issues now. I will escalate this to our engineering team immediately.</li>

   Hi Ernesto,
   
   We would much appreciate it if you could re-test on your end.

   The app is still giving me the error 500, and also the review queries are not working as they should</li>
<li>Wei Kong 2013-08-28

   The review fix is not deployed yet. which query still gives you 500 error?</li>
<li>Ernesto Sanchez Kuri 2013-08-28

   When trying to get the friend requests</li>
<li>Wei Kong 2013-08-28

   This is a new problem. which has nothing to do with this ticket. But can you please give me the query on friend requests?</li>
<li>Ernesto Sanchez Kuri 2013-08-28

   Nevermind, the error dissapeared. Now it's just the review query issue</li>
<li>Wei Kong 2013-08-28

   We have just deployed a fix to the review query issue. can you please try again. </li>
<li>Ernesto Sanchez Kuri 2013-08-28
