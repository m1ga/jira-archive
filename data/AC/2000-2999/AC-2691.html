<h3>Description</h3>

I am using the Ti.UI.EmailDialog to create a email to send with one attachment, in iOS it works, I can even add more than one image or file and they all show up and can be send, but in Android I cannot get any attachment to GMail or any internal email account software to work, I have tried in different phones and and SDKs, as well as tried to use older Android SDK like 2.3.3., latest tested is 4.0.3. Documentation says it should work for Android as well...

   I should add that I have configured the email client in my phone and tried both that one and the GMail client but without success, I have also tried to find this answer on Q&A but do not really find anyone that solved attaching image to android email . .</li>

   Please attach a simple runnable test case that we can drop into an app.js to reproduce your problem.
   
   Thanks!</li>

   After hours of investigation I found out that on iOS it is possible to have a file name : 34:56:67
   but on Android the colon ":" is not permitted, however I had no idea. And when I do a var date = new Date() I get it in the form Mon 23 June 23:23:12 CEST 2013, and so I cannot add the date to the filename of a Android file without exchanging the : to something else... :( Can I tell Date to output something without : ??
   
   Quesiton now is: Is this REALY a Android limitation, or is it Titanium limitation? Since I teach Titanium it would be great to know, thanks..</li>

   Colons are certainly not allowed on most OSs. I wouldn't ever include a colon or anything other than underscores or dashes in filenames.</li>
