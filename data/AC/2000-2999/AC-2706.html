<h3>Description</h3>

When adding windows with bottom alignment, upon opening the views jump up 20px or so before resting at their defined position of 0. 

This leaves undesirable flickering where you can see the previous screen behind the newly added window for a fraction of a second.

   [~iantearle] I tried to reproduce this but had little success. What would be helpful to QE would be to attach a small code sample. Also if you could let us know the iOS 7 version (assuming GM seed) and the actual SDK you are using. We had a few RC releases. Current build under test is: 3.1.3.v20130917141554.
   
   One thing you might try is to ensure you have a background color set on your windows. We have seen some issues with iOS 7 where you get poor animation when there is no color set on the window being animated.</li>

   I'm having the same issues on an iOS 7 device, using Ti build 3.2.1.201402041146. I have a 'toolbar' view positioned at <code>bottom: "0dp"</code> to its parent window and when navigating between windows in a <code>NavigationWindow</code> on an iOS device it pops up from ~20px below the bottom to 0. 
   
   Can't attach screen shots as it happens very quickly, however it is definately notable.</li>

   [~steve_fortune] Please provide a simple runnable test case to reproduce this issue and we would take another look.</li>
