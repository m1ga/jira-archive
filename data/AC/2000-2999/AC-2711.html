<h3>Description</h3>

When trying to compile a new project with iOS sdk 7.0.3 I get the error:

[ERROR] :  Invalid "--ios-version" value "7.0.3"
Accepted values:
   7.0
   6.1
Accepted values:
   7.0
   6.1
   6.0
For help, run: titanium help build
[ERROR] :  Invalid "--sim-version" value "7.0.3"


Is there any way to tell Titanium how to use 7.0.3? (I don't know where my former SKD 7.0 has gone :).

Curiously within my xCode folder (/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/SDKs) I find a folder "iPhoneOS7.0.sdk". I don't know where Titanium has got the "7.0.3" info from.

Best
Ronald

   The reporter requested this to be closed, since it's working. We did some testing and it's working for us as well. </li>

   I had this same issue when using the recent 3.2.0 RC and Studio. It seemed to be caused by old run configurations not being updated. When i refreshed the configuration the error message went away.</li>

   I had same issue, until I changed the build properties (Titanium SDK) into 3.0.2 GA. </li>
