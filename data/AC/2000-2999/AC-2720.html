<h3>Description</h3>

If you run Kitchen Sink on a device (iPhone 4 in my case, not SO fast) and navigate to Table Views, you will see that the table views open "after" the PushViewController animation.

I think this is due to the fact that the code is in a different context (loaded with URL).

If you look at the code, the KrollBridge evaluates the JS file for the window only in the UINavigationController delegate method "willShowViewController".

We should make so that the window is already loaded upon opening.
To do that we should make sure that the JS is evaluated sooner, somewhere in the "open" method.

   Hi Martin,
   
   Can you provide a small reproducible test case that demonstrates this issue.

   That s gonna be tough Jamie,
   It all depends on how fast the app is.
   Have you tried with KS on an iphone 4?
   It would be nice if you could try first, see if you "see" this behavior.
   
   If not i will try and make a test case  (don't really have time right now).
   
   Thanks</li>
</ol>
