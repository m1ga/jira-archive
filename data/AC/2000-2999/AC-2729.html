<h3>Description</h3>

setInterval function is not working correctly. It is losing time. In common language, if a watch counts 30 sec it is counting 29 sec. Attached project will demonstrate same. 

You can not replicate this in iOS simulator - this will happen only in devices.

The timer function is extremely important for my project.

   Sumit
   
   Thank you for raising this issue.
   
   Your code contains a lot of unnecessary code that could be influencing the behavior. Would you please write a test case, as described in [Creating a Test Case](<a href="http://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides/How+to+Submit+a+Bug+Report#HowtoSubmitaBugReport-CreatingaTestCase)?" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides/How+to+Submit+a+Bug+Report#HowtoSubmitaBugReport-CreatingaTestCase)?</a> Also, test cases should be added to the body of the ticket rather than as an attachment, to make it easy for the engineering team to assess.
   
   Once this is done, I will be able to move it across to the main project so that the engineering team can work on it.
   
   Thanks</li>

   As kindly, and correctly, explained by JongEun, Javascript timers are not guaranteed.
   
   <code><pre>
   > That's not a bug.
   > Javascript timer delay is not guranteed.
   > Becase Javascript excutes on a single thread.

   > You should not count in interval function :

   > 1. when the timer start, save current Time

   Thanks Paul for referring this. 
   
   Yes above comment solved my blocker, but main issue is this is happening in a particular set of devices and others are behaving normally.</li>
