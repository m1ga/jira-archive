<h3>Description</h3>

Hello,
I can't manage to make fastdev working properly. So here is the problem.

[Emulator is running]

Scenario A :
------------

1. Start fastdev in command line in the project directory
2. Run the app (titanium run --platform=android --android=/path/to/androidsdk)

I get the message : [WARN] Fastdev enabled, but server isn't running, deploying normally.
Also the fastdev lockfile is deleted in step 2 !


Scenario B :
------------

1. Restart fastdev in command line in the project directory. (Before I checked in my processes that it wasn't running anymore, and that there was no lockfile).
2. Check fastdev status (titanium fastdev status)

I get the message : 
Error: .fastdev.lock found in /home/me/myapp, but couldn't connect to the server on port 55168: [Errno -2] Name or service not known. Try manually deleting .fastdev.lock.


It's not a SELinux issue, i checked my system logs.
I also tried to connect on the fastdev socket with netcat and it work. 

(edit) See Question : <a href="http://developer.appcelerator.com/question/127135/fastdev-server-stops-just-afer-starting-to-build-my-app." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://developer.appcelerator.com/question/127135/fastdev-server-stops-just-afer-starting-to-build-my-app.</a> No workaround found.

Joseph.

   Joseph
   
   I apologize for it taking so long to look at this ticket.
   
   Please bear in mind that the only Linux OS we officially support is Ubutnu, as stated in the [Titanium Compatibility Matrix](<a href="https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides/Titanium+Compatibility+Matrix)." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides/Titanium+Compatibility+Matrix).</a> I am running Ubuntu 10.04 and Android fastdev works without issue. I have posted a useful link on fastdev to the Q&A ticket above, in case it helps.
   
   I am marking this ticket resolved. If you have not found a solution in the meantime, please reopen it, and we can continue the discussion.
   
   Cheers</li>
