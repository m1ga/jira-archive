		"description": "Hello,\r\nI can't manage to make fastdev working properly. So here is the problem.\r\n\r\n[Emulator is running]\r\n\r\nScenario A :\r\n------------\r\n\r\n1. Start fastdev in command line in the project directory\r\n2. Run the app (titanium run --platform=android --android=/path/to/androidsdk)\r\n\r\nI get the message : [WARN] Fastdev enabled, but server isn't running, deploying normally.\r\nAlso the fastdev lockfile is deleted in step 2 !\r\n\r\n\r\nScenario B :\r\n------------\r\n\r\n1. Restart fastdev in command line in the project directory. (Before I checked in my processes that it wasn't running anymore, and that there was no lockfile).\r\n2. Check fastdev status (titanium fastdev status)\r\n\r\nI get the message : \r\nError: .fastdev.lock found in /home/me/myapp, but couldn't connect to the server on port 55168: [Errno -2] Name or service not known. Try manually deleting .fastdev.lock.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's not a SELinux issue, i checked my system logs.\r\nI also tried to connect on the fastdev socket with netcat and it work. \r\n\r\n(edit) See Question : http://developer.appcelerator.com/question/127135/fastdev-server-stops-just-afer-starting-to-build-my-app. No workaround found.\r\n\r\nJoseph.\r\n",

I am running Ubuntu 10.04 and Android fastdev works without issue. I have posted a useful link on fastdev to the Q&A ticket above, in case it helps.\r\n\r\nI am marking this ticket resolved. If you have not found a solution in the meantime, please reopen it, and we can continue the discussion.\r\n\r\nCheers",
