<h3>Description</h3>

It seems, that all self created folders under the "Recources" folder are not copied to the app and further to the .ipa, when I run the app on device.

   Sebastian,
   
   Could you please test this with the 1.7.3 SDK and the release versions of iOS5 and Xcode, and update the ticket accordingly if the issues are not solved.
   
   Also to note, because Titanium is an open source project, we can't legally support pre release apple software due to terms in their NDA.
   
   Best regards,
   Matt</li>
