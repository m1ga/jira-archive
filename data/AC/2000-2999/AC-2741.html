<h3>Description</h3>

When I am using the Ti.Media.showCamera and taking a screenshot using the Ti.Media.takeScreenShot, it captures the current screen as required but it shows a black background, not the view through the camera.

This is how it works but is it a bug? should it capture the view through the camera.

Info

I am using Titanium studio with 1.7 SDK, and can only test on the iPhone as the overlay view on the android doesn't work yet (see other post).

A user case app can be found here. (cut and paste into app.js).

   In order for us to progress this issue, we need a concise usecase. Please whittle it down to the smallest possible code that runs without modification when pasted into a app.js file. Please try to avoid the use of namaspaces and custom functions. A simple set of consequative API calls are best, to ensure that the bug is with Titanium rather than your code.
   
   Many thanks

   Hi Paul
   
   yes have realised from the other bug that I have made the same mistake with the use case. I will get you an appropriate one as soon as possible.
   
   Thanks</li>

   OK, thank you, Trevor. I will close this for the moment, but once you have updated it with the usecase, I will move it to the relevant project.</li>

   Hi, I'm having the same problem here ! Do you think you might work on a fix ? I can provide example code etc. on Android platform. Using SDK 6.3.0.GA by the way !
   Thanks </li>
