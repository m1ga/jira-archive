<h3>Description</h3>

This is actually the exact issue described in TIMOB-3421 which should be reopened or revisited
The application shows up in the organizer without an icon or version.
Fortunately, the application does work when deployed to the device.  Both adHoc and Development profiles have been tested and work similarly.

   Thank you for this ticket. Unfortunately, we are unable to replicate this issue. However, I will watch for others experiencing the same problem and reopen this if/when that happens.
