<h3>Description</h3>

Hi all,
starting to look into memory leak on my app I found a weird behaviour on 1.7.1 that I can see as well in the last build of KitchenSink...

Basically just launching the app, after a bit it seems to start leaking but I can't figured out what exactly... this is happening also on a very simple app that does absolutely nothing if not just opening a window.

Here's a screenshot: <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1751555/Screenshots/3.png" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1751555/Screenshots/3.png</a>

   The KitchenSink is not intended to be an example of best coding practices, but rather to demonstrate the API usage in the simplest way possible. Thus, it may well exhibit problems like these.
   
   We are currently working on a "best practices" initiative that will help you mitigate the kinds of problems you have observed in your own app. We will release this when it's complete.
   
   Be aware that we will be looking in detail at memory management issues this month. However, if you can provide some *simple* code to demonstrate the issue, then you are welcome to create another ticket for it.
   
   Cheers</li>
