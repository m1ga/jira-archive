Thus, it may well exhibit problems like these.\n\nWe are currently working on a \"best practices\" initiative that will help you mitigate the kinds of problems you have observed in your own app. We will release this when it's complete.\n\nBe aware that we will be looking in detail at memory management issues this month. However, if you can provide some *simple* code to demonstrate the issue, then you are welcome to create another ticket for it.\n\nCheers",
