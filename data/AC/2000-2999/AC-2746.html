<h3>Description</h3>

In testing apps for the latest iOS 5 beta, I've found that audio recording in M4A / AAC is silently failing. 
A small file is always created of the same size all the time [57344 bytes] , but with no audio.

Recording in this format has always been possible before iOS 5. 

To test, try changing the recording format and compression values in the KS [sound_record.js](<a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/blob/master/demos/KitchenSink/Resources/examples/sound_record.js)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/blob/master/demos/KitchenSink/Resources/examples/sound_record.js)</a> demo to :

<code><pre>
recording.compression = Ti.Media.AUDIO_FORMAT_AAC;
recording.format = Ti.Media.AUDIO_FILEFORMAT_MP4A;
</pre></code>

This has been tested on an iPhone 4 and iPad2 running iOS 5.0 (9A5274d) 


Any ideas? This is critical fo alot of my apps to work.

   fyi: This seems to have worked fine in iOS5 Beta 3, but broken in iOS5 Beta 4</li>

   Hi Kosso
   
   I'm very sorry, we are grateful for your effort in raising this ticket, but unfortunately we only accept tickets for released software.
   
   To put it another way, the [Titanium Compatibility Matrix](<a href="http://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides/Titanium+Compatibility+Matrix#TitaniumCompatibilityMatrix-iOSSDK%2FTargetiOSPlatform)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides/Titanium+Compatibility+Matrix#TitaniumCompatibilityMatrix-iOSSDK%2FTargetiOSPlatform)</a> contains all the software that is officially supported, so if it isn't listed there, then we cannot accept a ticket for it.
   
   This is because it often happens that issues like these are resolved between beta releases without our intervention.
   
   I hope you can appreciate these reasons.
   
   Cheers</li>

   Hi,
   
   You'll be pleased (but possibly unconcerned) that the iOS5 Beta 5 has fixed the issue.
   
   Cheers</li>
