<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Steps to reproduce</h4>

<h4>Create a new default project.</h4>
<h4>Run project on Device.</h4>
<h4>Place phonecall to device.</h4>

Adding Activity event handlers ineffective as they don't seem to be fired before the crash.

<h4>Results</h4>

* Crash 100% of the time if you answer the call
* Crash 90% of the time if you ignore the call
* Crash 0% of the time if calling party terminates call before you make a decision
* Crash occurs if app is sent to background using home button as well

<h4>Logs</h4>

In DDMS observe:

<code><pre>

   While I understand that "win death" would not be described by a programmer as a "crash" that is how the end user perceives it.  This wouldn't be so much of a problem were the TabGroup activities to fire correctly so as to assist in the capture of the app state.  As it is, in order to cleanly restore a the app to the place it was when a user received a call or hit home, one has to write out the current state at every occasion it changes.  This is extremely high overhead.</li>

   Stephen
   
   If this report is accurate, I agree that this is a serious problem.
   
   Are there two issues here, though? ie:
   
   <h4>default app crashes when a phonecall is received (as per the results section)</h4>
   <h4>activities not fired for tabgroups (where is the test case for this?)</h4>
   
   If I am correct, then please open another ticket for the other issue.
   
   I will mark this resolved for now. I will reopen once I have fully understood the situation, and will then move it to the main project.
   
   Cheers</li>
