<h3>Description</h3>

I am using search bar functionality with alphabetically scroll into a list.
It is quit complex to implement But both of the code are separately managed & working very perfectly.

-What is the Bug?
As i start the search by entering text into search field it filters the list accordingly & keyboard being opened.
When i scrolls the list, the keyboard is getting disappeared as i wrote blur() on scroll event of tableview.
in this case the cancel button goes disabled & user is not able to cancel the search.This is the bug.

As i think what it happens, As soon as it gets unfocused the search bar, the cancel button goes disabled.Which is a bug.It doesn't happened in case of native iphone development. (eg. contact list of iphone works perfectly).

Please resolve this bug. I am getting late for delivery of my project.
looking for your reply.
