<h3>Description</h3>

I've set my distribution location to some directory. During computer clean up I've moved it, so for Studio it no longer exists. Despite that I'm still able to start APK creation process which fails at jar signing because the signed APK director not exists.

   In order for us to progress this, would you provide the Titanium SDK date and build, the full Studio build (Help / About), and the Studio log file?
   
   Thank you</li>
