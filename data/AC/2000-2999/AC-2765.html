<h3>Description</h3>

My bug is based on TIMOB-384 - it was created and closed in 1 minute with absolutely meaningless comment
{quote}Duplicate of a billion tableview rendering speed bugs.{quote} 

I was not able to find any of those billion speed bugs using text search and labels from the bug, there's also no links to corresponding task or future releases. Can anyone please tell me, when and what will be done with tableview rendering speed? It's major part of almost any kind of iOS application.

   I imagine the ticket was closed, because it didn't include any of the necessary information. Please see the [Jira Ticket Checklist](<a href="http://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides/Contributing+to+Titanium#ContributingtoTitanium-Summary%3AJiraTicketChecklist)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides/Contributing+to+Titanium#ContributingtoTitanium-Summary%3AJiraTicketChecklist)</a> for more guidance on this.
   
   Would you post a comment at the other bug, and (politely) ask Stephen to provide some links to relevant tickets. Please be aware that he's a very busy guy, but also typically extremely helpful. Thus, I am certain that he did not mean to leave you with half an answer, and will gladly provide the information you need.
   
   Thanks</li>

   Paul, if I could post a comment in any corresponding bug, I would definitely do it (like here in TISTUD-465, for example). But I can't post comment in the mentioned TIMOB-384, and, as I have already said, I can't find any other bug on that topic. If there's any way to get information from Stephen, please let me know about that. 
   In common: it would great to see duplicate links on such issues. This is JIRA workflow politeness, I believe. </li>

   You should definitely be able to post comments in the TiMob project. I will investigate this. Once resolved, I will let you know, so you can action my previous advice.
   
   Thanks</li>
