<h3>Description</h3>

I am more or less experiencing this issue while using the iad view:

<a href="http://developer.appcelerator.com/question/56541/iad-disappears-after-a-while---just-me" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://developer.appcelerator.com/question/56541/iad-disappears-after-a-while---just-me</a>

I have attached my iad control that falls back to admob if it recieves an error.  I am putting a background image on the view behind my ad to compensate for this occurring, but basically the iad will vanish after a period of time without firing any event.  Since there is not event I can't do anything to react to it and I'm stuck with my fall back image.

   Hi Miles,
   
   Could you please provide me a simple reproducible test case in app.js so that I can test it and see whats happening.

   Tested a sample app with iad. 'load' event is firing properly. <a href="http://pastie.org/4273680" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://pastie.org/4273680</a></li>

   If you wait ~10 minutes the iad will vanish and never reappear and nothing fires letting you know this happens. Seems to happen more often when you navigate to another window, wait a bit of time and revisit the last screen with the iad. It will be gone with just a blank spot where it was.
   
   edit:
   The intitial load will fire, or the error if it fails to load. The problem again is that the iad does load and it goes away, leaving a ugly empty blank space with no way to tell the app to fill it.</li>

   Try the following as a sample of the issue:
   
   Edit: error in original code:
   <a href="http://pastie.org/4273829" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://pastie.org/4273829</a>
   
   effectively the screen needs to adjust up and down to make space for the ad showing (so that controls are not covered).  There are times when the error event doesn't fire and so the screen remains with a 50 pixel space at the bottom.  In the discussion thread above there are similar explanations.</li>

   This is also a valid case for rejection from the appstore if you leave a blank space with no ad. It is just harder to catch this case as the initial load is handled correctly. But 'error' is never fired when subsequent loads fail.</li>

   Hi Miles/Paul,
   
   I could not reproduce the issue. The error event is fired and screen adjusts itself. Error event was fired after 10 load events and iad was hidden as written in the code.
