<h3>Description</h3>

Hi, I was having sporadic crashes of my app and I've narrowed it down to something happening when I get a specific http response from a service. I can recreate the issue. Below is a hardcoded response, what I see is that TI is having issues with it as the log output is truncating the data.

resp = "<a href=\"<a href="http://ons.ms/bidHGcbEL0FaYM/?url=http%253A%252F%252Fprazu.com%252Flp1%252F%253Fpartner%253D4%2526subID%253D" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://ons.ms/bidHGcbEL0FaYM/?url=http%253A%252F%252Fprazu.com%252Flp1%252F%253Fpartner%253D4%2526subID%253D</a>\"><img width=\"320\" height=\"50\" src=\"<a href="http://cdn.ons.ms/banners/firepath/1322719057593.jpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://cdn.ons.ms/banners/firepath/1322719057593.jpg</a>\" /></a>";
Titanium.API.debug('Resp '+resp);

On android emulator and iOS the full string is outputted on my Android device (and other devices) the string is truncated after <a href=\"<a href="http://ons.ms/bidHGcbEL0FaYM/?url=http" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://ons.ms/bidHGcbEL0FaYM/?url=http</a>

   Hi Frank,
   
   I tested this issue with Release 2.0.1 GA2 and could not reproduce it. I tested on both the emulator and Android devices with OS version 4 and version 2.3. 
   
   This was an issue in Release 1.8.2 of the SDK as I found out.  
   
   I am attaching a screenshot of the debug output from ddms.
   
   Thanks,
   Varun</li>

   Excellent.  if its fixed in 2.0.1 that is fine.  I'm upgrading as we speak.</li>
