<h3>Description</h3>

I am working in an application Where it requires Custom graphics on navigation controller. I included barImage & button's Images as well. Sometimes it loads all the graphics very perfectly but sometimes it missing only button's images.User is able to click on disappeared buttons but can see the buttons.Button are just like invisible in this case. After this, all the other screens navigating from this screen also follow the same pattern.

My Project is pending just because of this functionality.
Client is getting frustrated because of this issue (most probably SDk bug).
Please do something helpful. I tried all the tricks but no luck so far as.

please find the piece of Code for better understanding.

   Hi Suresh,
   
   Do you mean the buttons disappear in a navigation bar provided by a navigation group? Can you provide a simple code sample that reproduces the bug?
