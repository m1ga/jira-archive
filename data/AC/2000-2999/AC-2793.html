<h3>Description</h3>

no problems with iOS, but on android, the buttons in a custom table view are getting muddled up and are effecting different rows. I will have to try and build this on 1.8.2 to see if that remidies the problem, but i've tried 3 diff placements and methods of attaching the eventlisteners to the buttons.  no matter what, some buttons, not all, affect other buttons. There seems to be no pattern to it, as the they change.

The table row itself is clickable and leads to more detailed information, that remains unaffected and works as expected.

The screenshot below is to serve as an example, it happens on Android not iOS, and it may be 3, 4 or 5 rows apart between affected buttons.

   this might be a visual rendering problem and not mechanic.</li>

   Having discussed the problem with Tony Lukasavage on IRC, we tried to take "className" property out of my TableViewRows and that fixed the problem immediately, it might be worth mentioning or noting that somewhere. So my problem here is solved.</li>

   has to do with the caching of className rows.  Can't have dynamic layouts and apply a className</li>
