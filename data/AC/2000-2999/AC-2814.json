		"description": "I have been getting quite confused by the fact that my application seems to crash at different points every time I run the application in the emulator.  However, I recently discovered that if I run the application without the debugger, the application works every time perfectly, yet with the debugger enabled it will crash at different points in the application each time, and on occasion the app runs with the debugger enabled.\r\n\r\nI have tried all of the following to resolve the issue:\r\n* Clean the build folder and even delete the entire build folder\r\n* Restart my machine and Titanium Studio\r\n* Turn off all breakpoints and watches\r\n* Turn on breakpoints and step through. If I step through, I tend to have more success in getting the app to run, but that is not guaranteed.\r\n\r\nWhen the emulator crashes, I get one of the following two messages:\r\n* \"[DEBUG] Session did end with error (null)\"\r\n* \"[DEBUG] Session did end with error Error Domain=DTiPhoneSimulatorErrorDomain Code=1 \"The simulated application quit.\" UserInfo=0x10011f660 {NSLocalizedDescription=The simulated application quit., DTiPhoneSimulatorUnderlyingErrorCodeKey=-1}\"\r\n\r\nMy application is nothing particularly complex.  It uses SQLite, HTTPClient, and a bunch of views & windows which run in sub-contexts.  I find that sometimes after the debugger has crashed, there are 5 or so threads running, yet in normal operation I never have more than 3 windows open so I am confused as to why it is showing 5 threads.\r\n\r\nAs you can see from http://developer.appcelerator.com/question/123608/debugger-on-ios-causes-the-app-to-crash-in-the-emulator-frequently#comment-92974, this issue is being experience by other users.\r\n\r\nI currently have NO workaround solution for this, I am simply without a debugger now which I am paying for.  \r\n\r\nPlease can you help.  I can happily send you my entire code base, but trying to create a sample bit of code which replicates this issue is unfortunately just not possible.  It seems that the debugger is simply struggling with the code base, and erratically falters at different points every time.\r\n\r\nMatt\r\n",

This is what is so frustrating about the whole thing.  I spent an hour trying everything to get the debugger to work after I had committed my code, and could not get it to work.  I then shifted to another branch, did some work, and now shifted back and it works again.  I'm sure some time in the next 24 hours it will start happening again, so when it does I will capture the complete log and post that up.\r\n\r\nHowever, in terms of sending you my code, I am happy to do this, but I am unable to post it here unfortunately as this is a public forum.
