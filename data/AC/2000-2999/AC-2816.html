<h3>Description</h3>

I need to uninstall some older SDKs and install a couple older ones (SDK 1.7 needs to be uninstalled, need to install 1.8.0).  I have the newer 2.0.1g a SDK.

I can't seem to find the SDK folders: <a href="http://developer.appcelerator.com/question/135903/cant-find-sdks--mobilesdks-folder-on-osx" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://developer.appcelerator.com/question/135903/cant-find-sdks--mobilesdks-folder-on-osx</a>

THis makes installation/uninstallation impossible.  Really need this help.

   Hi Junaid,
   
   No. I've already tried those folders and none of them seem to have the mobilesdk folders :-(</li>

   Via IRC - Prashant managed to fix the issue by doing the following:
   
   *in Lion they changed this to hidden folders
   *the trick is to goto Finder and then user the Go --> Goto Folder and type in ~/Library
   *and it'll bring it up
   *just wanted to let you know since u said someone else also had this issue. It's a Lion thing.</li>
