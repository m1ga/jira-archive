<h3>Description</h3>

I see that in the Kitchen Sink use of TableView.headerPullView and TableView.setContentInsets are methods of the Titanium.UI.TableView object, yet they are not documented.

Could you please update the documentation to reflect this?

Also, is there a footerPullView property as well.  Would be useful if there was a the pull to refresh can often be useful at the bottom of the list.

   Hi Paul
   
   Please check the details of my ticket.  Yes, it IS PARTIALLY covered by TIMOB-2960, but TIMOB-2960 does not cover setContentInsets, and does not address footerPullView either.
   
   Do you want to reopen this one and I will just remove the mention of headerPullView then so there is not an overlap?

   Please note the title of TIMOB-2960. There is no need to have another ticket for it.
