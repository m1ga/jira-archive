<h3>Description</h3>

Please see TIDESK-653, the resolution given isn't valid and the test cases mentioned in github do not reproduce my issue.

You have to have a pre-processed php file, with <?php ?>, it is its own file that a user may navigate to (not included using Titanium.include or any other javascript API/methods)

Specifically, you have to include a large 3rd party library, I provided a link to an example library that causes it to fail.

   I can't comment or do anything useful on any other tickets, so I have to create duplicates. I will attached example project here..it appears to only happen in Titanium Developer, and not Titanium Studio.</li>
