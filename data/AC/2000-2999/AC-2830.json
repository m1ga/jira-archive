		"description": "When testing app with camera feature on 1.7.3, black screen after taking picture/editing doesn't happen.\r\n\r\nNow after upgrading 1.7.6 nightly, black screen appears right after taking picture or editing. Weird thing we found is device complains about running out of memory with 64MB remaining:\r\n\r\n2011-11-19 03:57:40 Received memory warning. Level=1\r\n2011-11-19 03:57:40 [INFO] Due to memory conditions, 0 of 0 image cache entries were unloaded from cache.\r\n2011-11-19 03:57:41 [DEBUG] Remaining memory: 63.90625\r\n\r\nAfter restarting the device and app started with 256MB+ memory left, black screen after taking/editing picture didn't show up. \r\n\r\nWe run further tests, opened several apps on phone and after opening several number of apps, black screen after taking picture/edit appeared on 1.7.6 build with the following log:\r\n\r\n2011-11-19 04:24:39 [Warning] IORegisterForSystemPower failed\r\n2011-11-19 04:24:41 [DEBUG] Remaining memory: 8.3046875\r\n2011-11-19 04:24:44 Received memory warning. Level=1\r\n2011-11-19 04:24:44 [INFO] Due to memory conditions, 0 of 0 image cache entries were unloaded from cache.\r\n\r\nWe installed version which was built using 1.7.3 and  black screen after taking picture didn't appear. We noticed that remaining memory when app starts is usually higher:\r\n\r\n2011-11-19 04:47:01 [DEBUG] Remaining memory: 83.10546875\r\n\r\nWe tested application built with 1.7.6 again just to confirm how much memory is left when app start and we got this:\r\n\r\n2011-11-19 04:58:25 [DEBUG] Remaining memory: 17.36328125\r\n\r\nand after taking a picture:\r\n\r\n2011-11-19 04:58:55 [Warning] IORegisterForSystemPower failed\r\n2011-11-19 04:58:55 [DEBUG] Remaining memory: 11.00390625\r\n2011-11-19 04:58:56 Received memory warning. Level=1\r\n2011-11-19 04:58:56 [INFO] Due to memory conditions, 0 of 0 image cache entries were unloaded from cache.\r\n\r\nThe summary is memory management in 1.7.3 is better compare to 1.7.6 nightly. Also we noticed that app starts with bigger memory on 1.7.3 compare to 1.7.6 although it might not be accurate.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nRey\r\n",
