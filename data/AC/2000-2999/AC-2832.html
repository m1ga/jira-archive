<h3>Description</h3>

In Android, when using Ti.Media.showCamera, after successfully taking a picture and hitting "OK" in the Android camera app, the Titanium application will restart. It seems to be an issue with low available memory on the device, since Android seems to restart the Ti Activity (along with other activities).

   Same issue happens to me with Ti Mobile SDK 1.7.2 and 1.8.0. I found a workaround however. This is due to modal or fullscreen windows in Android as they are launched in a separate activity. Ensure that the window Ti.Media.showCamera is called from and the window displaying the image just taken is not modal or fullscreen.

   hm... I'm not sure I understand this.
   I ran into the same problem with my application.
   But instead of creating a window for every view that we want to render we're currently hiding view A and showing view B.
   That means our application has got one main window with lots of views and subviews on it.
   Now I have been checking whether we are applying modal or fullscreen to that main window, but both isn't the case ...
   Do I have to create two different windows for calling the camera action and displaying the result? (and do these windows need to have differen attributes?)
   This is the only remaining bug that could keep us from releasing the app :)
   Thanks for any help on this!</li>
