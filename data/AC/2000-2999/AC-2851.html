<h3>Description</h3>

Titanium Studio doesn't start if login fails. In real life what this means is I can't start studio when offline.
I have filed as a bug because it prevents use completely when offline. I can't believe others haven't been affected by this. Unfortunately trains, planes etc still don't have great wifi or mobile data coverage and this just prevents use of a potentially productive time ;)

   Hello,
   
   Which version of Studio are you using? I tried to run it right now, using v2.1.0.201206251749, and it works just well without an internet connection.
   
   Thanks</li>

   I have actually had this problem before. It seems to happen when you are connected to a network, but that network has no internet connection. After you attempt to run studio in that situation, it says you failed to log in. After that you will be locked out of studio until you get on the internet again, even if you are connected to no network at all.</li>

   Thank you Kyle. That could very well be the case for me too. I experienced this at work where I get a wifi connection, but no internet.</li>

   Is there a way to get this reopened? </li>

   Closing this since we can't reproduce this issue. We were able to start studio without Internet connection and create application also. However, for the first time you must connect to the Internet to configure this studio. Please check with our latest Ti Studio and update if the issue persists.</li>
