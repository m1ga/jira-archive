<h3>Description</h3>

I am more and more frequently getting this buggy behaviour when trying to build for iOS on my dev machine to the point where 3/4 the build fails.

Error Below:

   Hi Ket
   
   Would you state the iOS version you have tested, please?
   
   Please note the formatting changes I've made.
   
   Thanks</li>

   Ket
   
   In order to accept this, I will need the full contents of the build.log file.
   
   Thank you</li>
<li>Paul Dowsett 2011-12-19

   iPhone folder build.log file - still getting these intermittent crashes and Studio Freezing up.</li>
<li>David Rodriguez 2011-12-31

   After quitting the simulator, the process ios-sim keeps running even after terminating it in titanium studio.</li>
<li>Paul Dowsett 2011-12-31

   Ket, is this still happening when using the 1.8.0.1 official release?
   
   Thanks</li>
<li>Paul Dowsett 2012-01-10

   Ket
   
   You mentioned in our telephone conversation that this issue may be resolved now. Would you mind checking, so that I can close it if possible?
   
   Thanks a lot

   I am having this same problem with the latest released SDK and Studio. I have to restart the Studio to be able to continue.</li>
<li>Ketan Majmudar 2012-01-10

   These errors / behaviour have stopped since the public release of Studio and the Stable SDK were released. I re-installed the latest available version of studio and then ran the stable updates. 
   
   Seems as though it may have been the beta builds causing the problems.

    Thank you for the update, Ketan.
    
    Paul, as Ket is no longer having this issue, I am going to close this ticket. Would you please open a new one with your own findings?

    Thank you</li>

    As advised by the user, this has been fixed.</li>
