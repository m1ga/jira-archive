<h3>Description</h3>

Decided to take a look at Appcelerator, and clicked the link for "Quick Start" in the "Reminder: Install the Titanium Mobile Development Platform‚Äè" email I recently recieved.

Any link on the left hand side seemingly does nothing at least 10 seconds, then returns:

"Oops...
Guide Plugging_Studio_into_an_existing_Eclipse_configuration was not found.
If you think this is an error, please file a bug."

   The link from email with the token doesnt work:
   
   <a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/2.1/index.html?mkt_tok=3RkMMJWWfF9wsRokuanAZKXonjHpfsX/7uovWa%2B%2BlMI/0ER3fOvrPUfGjI4ATsdhI/qLAzICFpZo2FFZCvCWeYxF6PRJBFM%3D#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/2.1/index.html?mkt_tok=3RkMMJWWfF9wsRokuanAZKXonjHpfsX/7uovWa%2B%2BlMI/0ER3fOvrPUfGjI4ATsdhI/qLAzICFpZo2FFZCvCWeYxF6PRJBFM%3D#</a>!/guide/Quick_Start
   
   however if you remove the token:
   
   <a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/2.1/index.html#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/2.1/index.html#</a>!/guide/Quick_Start

   Hi Glynn,
   
   Its working fine on Win7 machine on Chrome. Maybe the server was down when you tried to access it. Marking it as invalid.

   If it was the server I wouldnt still having it not work if you click the first link in the comment in any browser.
   
   It only happens on links with the mkt_tok variable on it.
   
   Would you like me to forward you the email the link comes from?  Would it being opened in Hotmail make a difference? I wouldnt think so</li>

   Hi Glynn,
   
   I believe the above Jira link does not open for you as its private. That issue was reported(in the Jira) and the new email with '<a href="http://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides/Home" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides/Home</a>' will be sent from now onwards.
   
   Thank You,
   Anirudh</li>
