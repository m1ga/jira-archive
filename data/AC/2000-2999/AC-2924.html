<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Steps to Reproduce</h4>
When I enter code and hit a period, the UI will freeze for 5-6 seconds. It seems like it's trying
to do something involving the autocompletion dialogs, but then times out. This happens for every
period I type.

<h4>Actual Result</h4>
There is nothing in the log when I open Help > Titanium Studio > View Log. I am currently trying to evaluate the
software and have been unable to really use it.

<h4>Expected Result</h4>
Software should display the autocomplete dialog inline with no noticable pause in the interface. I think the
problem may be an SDK issue, but I don't know how to fix.

   What language are you typing in, and what size file are you using? Can you please attach your Studio log file (Help > Titanium Studio > View Log File)?</li>

   Hi Brad,
   
   Can you provide more information about your development environment? Does the issue occur when creating a new project?</li>
