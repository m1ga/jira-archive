<h3>Description</h3>

Hi , I am showing on my app a tableview , each row on that tableview has label and has image . the image can be big size.
The effect , when you scroll down it's very very laggy and sometime stuck before showing the next rows like freezing and then unfreezing .
That making the UX of the navigation really bad.
Looks like it is rendering the image every pixel that i scroll down and that's make the scroll very very bad.
Any one experienced suce problem and know how to solve it ?

How to reproduce :
build an app that taking pictures from camera .
Save pictures on filesystem
render pictures as imageview on a table
do that until you have around 10 or 20 rows .
try to scroll 
scrolling is not possible table is jumpy and not reflect your movement.

( You can try above also from loading big pictures without taking them from camera )

what i tried to do :
When loading small images from internet -> work as expected
when loading small images from filesystem -> work as expected
when loading big images and resize them -> not working table is jumpy and laggy.

Thanks.

   In addition to this, please try your app with the v8 runtime - there are vast speed improvements, although I admittedly don't know for certain whether it will resolve this tableview issue.</li>
