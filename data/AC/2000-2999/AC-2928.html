<h3>Description</h3>

As a standard user I can't add comments to issues I have reported once they have been moved to APSTUD project.

Ingo is asking for feedback @ #APSTUD-2704 but I don't have any options to add a reply.

   I can add a comment here however...</li>

   This seems to have been fixed, I now have a comment button for APSTUD issues.</li>

   One thing I have noticed, is that although I can now create issues directly under APSTUD project, I can't attach files any more. This was useful for posting screenshots of problems.
   
   There are also a lot of form fields relating to project planning, etc that are of no use to general users reporting bugs. I'm not sure if Jira will let you remove these based on user group but it would probably save you guys having to change stuff that was set incorrectly.</li>
