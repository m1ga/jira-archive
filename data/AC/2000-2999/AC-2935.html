<h3>Description</h3>

First discovered with my own app. Created simple test app and problem still seen. Then compiled Kitchen Sink and KS also has the same issue.

Run kitchen sink on a 1st gen iPad and there is audio for the local video. Run KS on a 2nd gen iPad and there is no audio.

   I have found another iPad 2nd Generation that *does work*.
   
   I grabbed the model numbers:
   - working iPad2 MC916LL
   - NOT working iPad2 MC770LL</li>

   Hi Chaim,
   
   I could not reproduce the issue on the iPad 2 (model MC705LL). On the iPad 2 it does not work on, does playing the same video in the native video player work as expected?</li>
<li>Chaim Krause 2012-08-03

   Yes. I emailed the movie and it opened fine on the device.
   
   Additionally, the other day I tested on an iPad 3rd Gen and it worked fine.
   
   It can conceivably be a problem only on that iPad because of some settings or some app(s) that are on it. Although the owner, since the problem, synched his iPad to the cloud, did a factory reset, and synched from the cloud and the problem remains.
   
   How can I get the necessary troubleshooting information to examine this further?</li>

   Is the device in question jail broken?
   </li>
<li>Chaim Krause 2012-08-12

   No, the device is not jail broken.</li>

   After the recent updates of both Ti SDK to 2.1.1 and Xcode, I rebuilt my app and the sound is working. So I am not sure what update fixed things, but it was one or the other.</li>
