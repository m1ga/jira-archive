<h3>Description</h3>

Launching the application in portrait mode (the default) shows no visible items. Scrolling the window down shows the items, but they spring out of view again when the finger is released. The top menu does not appear. See attached screenshot portrait.png.

When rotated to landscape, the list appears correctly. See attached screenshot landscape.png.

   Hi James,
   
   Can you please provide a code sample that reproduces the issue? Does the issue occur when building with an officially released version of the SDK such as 2.0.2GA?</li>
<li>James Tatum 2012-07-02

   Hi Betty,
   
   I put the SDK version in the environment tab in JIRA - it is the GA 2.0.2. The code sample is the Todo list sample application which comes with Titanium Studio. For fun, I tried it with the new SDK 2.1.0.GA. The issue still occurs.</li>

   Hi James,
   
   I have tested the sample using the environment described and was unable to reproduce the bug. Which version of Titanium Studio are you running? </li>
<li>James Tatum 2012-07-03

   Thank you so much for trying it. My Studio updated and I'm no longer seeing the issue. How very strange. Thanks again.</li>
<li>Betty Tran 2012-07-03

   Closing because the bug can not be reproduced. The reporter of the bug has found that the latest version of Titanium Studio contains a bug free version of the todo list sample.</li>
