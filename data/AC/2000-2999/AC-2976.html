<h3>Description</h3>

I have a simple form/UI with a Titanium.UI.WebView that targets an iPad output.
> I point the webview (its URL property) to a very boring html page served up by a box on our network.
> I hit "go"
> the iOS simulator starts up
> that simple page is displayed fine
> I change the URL to very simple ASPX (.net) page
>>> an asp:button and an asp:label
>>> the button has a server side event to put some text in the label
>>> the button also has some client-side JS code to alert('hi')
> I hit "go"
> The page displays fine
> I click the button
> the JS code alert triggers; i see the alert
> the label's text DOES NOT GET updated ... NOT working here
> (something is preventing the page's server side lifecycle from completing)
> as long as I am on the iOS emulator, i fire up mobile Safari.
> go to that same page
> click the button
> i get the JS/alert
> the label's text DOES GET updated ... it works.
>>>>>>>>>>>
Now, here is where the inconsistency arrises.
> I change the output/target for the application to be android.
> I hit "go"
> The android emulator fires up
> The app launches and goes to my page
> I click the button
> The JS code does execute; I see the Alert 'hi'
> The label's text does get updated
> Everything works; page life cycle with the server completes successfully.

SO, i am seeing two very distinct and project-threatening behaviours with Titanium depending on what I am targeting.  I know my simple page works.  It's a simple page; no reason it shouldn't work. 

Summary: 
App with webview deployed to iOS ... does not work.
App with webview deployed to android ... does work.
Hitting the same page on either platforms' browser ... does work.

   Could you please provide a reproducible sample test case? </li>

   I solved a webView with JS bug today by using the latest CI build from <a href="http://builds.appcelerator.com.s3.amazonaws.com/mobile/master/mobilesdk-2.1.0.v20120530151809-osx.zip" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://builds.appcelerator.com.s3.amazonaws.com/mobile/master/mobilesdk-2.1.0.v20120530151809-osx.zip</a>
   
   An older 2.0.1 version had inconsistencies between iOS and Android. 
   
   It might be worth giving that a try. </li>
