		"description": "I have a simple form/UI with a Titanium.UI.WebView that targets an iPad output.\r\n> I point the webview (its URL property) to a very boring html page served up by a box on our network.\r\n> I hit \"go\"\r\n> the iOS simulator starts up\r\n> that simple page is displayed fine\r\n> I change the URL to very simple ASPX (.net) page\r\n>>> an asp:button and an asp:label\r\n>>> the button has a server side event to put some text in the label\r\n>>> the button also has some client-side JS code to alert('hi')\r\n> I hit \"go\"\r\n> The page displays fine\r\n> I click the button\r\n> the JS code alert triggers; i see the alert\r\n> the label's text DOES NOT GET updated ... NOT working here\r\n> (something is preventing the page's server side lifecycle from completing)\r\n> as long as I am on the iOS emulator, i fire up mobile Safari.\r\n> go to that same page\r\n> click the button\r\n> i get the JS/alert\r\n> the label's text DOES GET updated ... it works.\r\n>>>>>>>>>>>\r\nNow, here is where the inconsistency arrises.\r\n> I change the output/target for the application to be android.\r\n> I hit \"go\"\r\n> The android emulator fires up\r\n> The app launches and goes to my page\r\n> I click the button\r\n> The JS code does execute; I see the Alert 'hi'\r\n> The label's text does get updated\r\n> Everything works; page life cycle with the server completes successfully.\r\n\r\nSO, i am seeing two very distinct and project-threatening behaviours with Titanium depending on what I am targeting.  I know my simple page works.  It's a simple page; no reason it shouldn't work. \r\n\r\nSummary: \r\nApp with webview deployed to iOS ... does not work.\r\nApp with webview deployed to android ... does work.\r\nHitting the same page on either platforms' browser ... does work.",
