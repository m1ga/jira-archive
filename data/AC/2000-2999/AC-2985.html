<h3>Description</h3>

Some source control systems (e.g. Perforce) set the file access permissions to Read Only (i.e. r--r--r--, 444). This attributes carries over to the files that are copied to the build folders which causes numerous issues as subsequent builds attempt to overwrite those files. The builder scripts should modify the permissions on the newly created build files and add write permission for the owner.

   You should exclude all files in the build folder from your VCS. I am closing as invalid, although feel free to reopen if I have misunderstood. Thanks</li>

   My build folder is not in my VCS. The issue is that my VCS sets files to read-only at check-in (as many do). When those files are copied to the build directory by builder.py, they retain their read-only state. The next build you do after that fails because builder.py is trying to overwrite a read only file.</li>
