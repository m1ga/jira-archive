<h3>Description</h3>

When using a ActivityIndicator in an application and a openUrl-function to open an external web browser, when pressing the back button in the browser, any ActivityIndicator in the program will produce an exception and eventually crash the program.

The following error message is shown: [<a href="http://pastie.org/2161668" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://pastie.org/2161668</a>]

The following code will reproduce the bug: [<a href="http://pastie.org/2161675" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://pastie.org/2161675</a>]

Make sure to wait for the page to finish loading s√• that the app is relaunched and not just returned to (which is another issue of mine).

   Okey, so I found some more clues. Apparently I get low memory on my android device (emulator) which forces my application to close.
   
   Is there a way to increase it's memory to prevent it from crashing? 
   
   Complete console output: [<a href="http://pastie.org/2161859" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://pastie.org/2161859</a>]
   
   Although the memory seems to be the root to my problem, the problem with ActivityIndicator crashing after a program crash still exists.</li>

   It's great that you created [a Q&A question](<a href="http://developer.appcelerator.com/question/121996/activityindicator-crashes-after-returning-from-external-web-browser-on-android)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://developer.appcelerator.com/question/121996/activityindicator-crashes-after-returning-from-external-web-browser-on-android)</a> to consult the community before raising this ticket, as this is the recommended approach. However, it's useful to also include a link to it in the ticket for reference.
   
   
   I think the problem may be caused by the way you are using the API. See my answer in the Q&A. If it transpires that this really is a bug, I will be happy to reopen this ticket.
   
   Thanks</li>

   Posted a modified version of my code as a comment to your answer.
   
   Never the less, even if it turns out that this is a problem caused by my misuse of the API, shouldn't it at least be fixed so it does not crash. Or at least specified in the documentation.</li>
