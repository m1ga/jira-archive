   Would you please edit your ticket to use the formatting markup provided, and include the platform you are using, the platform SDK version, and the Titanium SDK build dates/hashes?
   
   Then we can progress this ticket.
   
   Thanks</li>

   Again, if you *edit* your ticket to include the information (rather than post to comments) I will be happy to move it across.
   
   Actually, this issue is common to both iOS and Android, so I have a feeling that it may be due to tooling. I will investigate this with the core team.
   
   When you are ready to improve the ticket, you are welcome to reopen.
   
   Cheers</li>

   Sorry for the confusion with this ticket. Our review process is clearer now, so your next ticket will hopefully be a little easier.
   
   There have been a lot of fixes in the latest release relating to require(). It should work correctly now.
   As you say anyway, this ticket duplicates TIMOB-5123. Hence, I will close it.
   
   Thanks for your input.</li>
