<h3>Description</h3>

Local notifications can be set but will not fire unless the app has been manually added to the new notification centre, in the settings menu, in iOS5. notification permissions were previously automatic pre-iOS5. Any new apps installed will not by default be given notification permissions and must be manually added by the user. Any pre-installed apps before iOS5 upgrade are withdrawn from notification centre on iOS5 upgade. Notifications work on the emulator, but not on a device.

   This is just how apple does things now... we cant change this via code at this time. Maybe in the future apple will open an API for this.</li>

   Thanks Matthew! It just does seem strange that all other apps go into the notification center automatically when they're downloaded.</li>
