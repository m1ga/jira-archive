<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Problem</h4>

setcurrentPlaybackTime() no longer functions under 1.8.2 for video players under iOS


<h4>Expectations</h4>

setCurrentPlayBacktime() should be functional allowing for seek forward or seek backwards

<h4>Solution</h4>

Add the following code back into 
<code><pre>
-(void)setCurrentPlaybackTime:(id)value
{
    [self player].currentPlaybackTime=[TiUtils doubleValue:value];
    
}

</pre></code>

   You can close this.
   It must have been removed further back than 1.8.1 and I hacked it into 1.8.1 because of a PREVIOUS regression.
   Guess I'll keep rehacking functionality back in.</li>

   Hi 
   
   I added code given by you in my TiMediaVideoPlayerProxy.m and worked perfectly on simulator.
   but the problem is we need to add this code in local(app's) TiMediaVideoPlayerProxy.m file also.
   And when we install our app on device studio 'cleans' our project which removes this code from local file.. 
   and now this function does not work on device(ipad).
   
   How to make this changes persistent?pls help..</li>

   Has to be added to the SDK itself, located down in ~/Library/Application Support/Titanium</li>
<li>Amol Jadhav 2012-03-29

   yes i have added this in ~/Library/Application Support/Titanium..
   but it dose not work by adding only there..it needs to add in local copy also to work properly..
   
   but it gets removed when we clean project..
   
   what should I do?</li>
<li>Stephen Feather 2012-03-29

   If you have to add it to the "local" (and I'm not sure what this means, in the build folder?) then you might not be pulling the correct SDK.
   
   The method I mentioned above works as I require it for ALL my multimedia apps.</li>
