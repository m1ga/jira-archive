<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Problem</h4>

ActivityIndicator displays text but not spinner on iPad

<h4>Test case</h4>

In the following code, I see the text "Loader" but not the actual "spiller icon".

<code><pre>
var actInd = Titanium.UI.createActivityIndicator({
    height:100,
    width:100,
    style:Ti.UI.iPhone.ActivityIndicatorStyle.BIG,
    message:'Loader',
    color:'#0c2d83'
});
</pre></code>

<h4>Logs</h4>

Please provide any relevant logs

   Thanks for raising this ticket.
   
   Please note my changes, to make bring it into line with our [JIRA Ticket Checklist](<a href="https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides/How+to+Submit+a+Bug+Report#HowtoSubmitaBugReport-JIRATicketChecklist)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides/How+to+Submit+a+Bug+Report#HowtoSubmitaBugReport-JIRATicketChecklist)</a> guidelines. For the description, I have used [this template](<a href="https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides/JIRA+Ticket+Template)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides/JIRA+Ticket+Template)</a> as a starting point.
   
   However, we must be able to reproduce the issue in order to accept it, and so a test case must be included and run without modification, as per the [Creating a Test Case](<a href="https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides/How+to+Submit+a+Bug+Report#HowtoSubmitaBugReport-CreatingaTestCase)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides/How+to+Submit+a+Bug+Report#HowtoSubmitaBugReport-CreatingaTestCase)</a> section. Please would you change your code accordingly?
   
   Thanks in advance for your cooperation.
   
   Cheers</li>

   Just create a view, then add actInd.
   
   Sorry, I'm just trying to help you, by raising the attention about this bug in your software, I don't want to include all the code for my app in this case.
   
   I hope you understand.

<li>Paul Dowsett 2012-01-05

   Rasmus, the point is to keep the code as concise as possible - your whole app is not suitable as a test case. You have the environment configured, and you know exactly the issue you are seeing. By providing a test case that runs, it will allow us to see precisely what you mean.
   
   Please refer to the [Creating a Test Case](<a href="https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides/How+to+Submit+a+Bug+Report#HowtoSubmitaBugReport-CreatingaTestCase)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides/How+to+Submit+a+Bug+Report#HowtoSubmitaBugReport-CreatingaTestCase)</a>, so that we can get this resolved for you.
   
   Thanks for your cooperation.

   I have a working workaround, where I use a webview with an GIF animation instead.
   I was just trying to be helpful and report the bug, you didn't used to be so strict about that… After all I'm just trying to help you improve the quality of your product… Actually I was considering upgrading from my current free plan to a paying plan (due to some new and large projects in my pipeline), but I think I will reconsider that, if this is the level of understanding and response I can expect to get, when reporting a bug…
   
   You can close the case, if you can't use the feedback!
   
   All the best,
   Rasmus</li>
