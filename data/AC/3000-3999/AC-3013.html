<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>The problem</h4>

View doesn't layout child components well when "horizontal" layout is used and child component has margins defined via "left" and "top" properties.

To see this, run this example:

<code><pre>
(function() {
     
    var win = Ti.UI.createWindow({ navBarHidden: true });
    
    var view = Ti.UI.createView({
    	height: Ti.UI.FILL,
    	width: Ti.UI.FILL,
    	backgroundColor: "#fff",
    	layout: "horizontal"
    });
    
    for (var i = 0; i &lt; 10; ++i) {
    	view.add(Ti.UI.createLabel({ height: "75dp", width: Ti.UI.FILL, text: "Label " + i, left: 20, top: 10, backgroundColor: "#00f" }));
    }
    
    win.add(view);
    
    win.open();
    
})();
</pre></code>

You should see that first label has top and left margin, while others do not.


<h4>Expected behavior</h4>

All labels should behave in same manner - they should all have top and left margins, not only the first one.

   Hello Ivan,
   
   why are you using the 'horizontal' layout, if your label has a witdh equals to Ti.UI.FILL? Using the 'vertical' layout, the result should be the one you are looking for: labels are placed 20px from the left and 10px from the top, and they are as large as the display; you can also test setting a fixed width for the labels (e.g. 75dp) and see that they are correctly placed in the screen (e.g. second one is 20px right the first one etc.).
   
   Isn't this the result you want to achieve? Can you explain more in detail, in case the goal is different?
   
   Thank you</li>

   Hello Davide.
   
   
   I'm trying to position label-input pairs.
   
   
     label1 input1
     
     label2 input2
   
   
   To make that look better, I want to have left and top margin.
   
   
   This issue was reported because I couldn't achieve that with "horizontal" layout. The test case is reduced so it represents minimal example that shows the issue.
   
   
   I tried to use "vertical" layout, but it has some other problems. :)
   
   
   
   Thanks for your help.</li>

   Ivan,
   
   I have tried to follow all the steps you provided in order to reproduce this error you are seeing. After running the code you provided on an asus ee pad (3.2), I see no error or anything working different from how it should. Can you provide a screenshot or a more detailed explanation of what is not working "well"? 
   
   Thank you,
   
   Carter</li>

   Hi Carter,
   
   
   this issue seems to be fixed with latest CI build. Don't know what commit fixed it, but you can close it now. :)
   
   
   
   Thanks.</li>
