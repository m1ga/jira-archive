<h3>Description</h3>

The following API calls into the module fail expecting to find the TiUtils isIOS4OrGreater procedure:

imageAsThumbnail
imageAsResized

The simulator log is shown below.

The attached Test project may be used to reproduce the error and validate the fix.  Click the top button (labeled "Add Alpha") to cycle through the transformations.  The error will occur on the fourth click when the button is labeled "Thumbnail" and will fail for the next two clicks as the imageAsResized function is used in both LOW and HIGH compression modes.

   Scott
   
   Thank you for raising this, but it is a duplicate of an existing ticket. Also, even though you cloned that other ticket, you did not follow the format. For both of these reasons, I cannot accept it.
   
   However, your attached project may well be useful. I have added it to the other ticket. Thank you for providing it.
   
   If this issue is important to you, watch ticket TC-502.
   
   Cheers</li>
