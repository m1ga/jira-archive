<h3>Description</h3>

The three methods of accessing the Inspector are unusable.

1. Main Menu option available, produces nothing.
2. Context Menu (Right-Click in Window) is missing.
3. In code:

<code><pre>
var $WIN = Titanium.UI.getCurrentWindow();
$WIN.showInspector();
</pre></code>

All three methods continue to work for me when building against 1.0.0 and 1.1.0.
