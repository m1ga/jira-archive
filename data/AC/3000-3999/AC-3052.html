<h3>Description</h3>

The Titanium.App.iOS.BackgroundService dies after the iOS device has been locked.

I have an app, where I use the Titanium.App.iOS.registerBackgroundService to create a BackgroundService to update the appBadge (Titanium.UI.iPhone.appBadge). This works just fine, untill I lock the device (or it goes to sleep) - then when I unlock the screen, it looks like the BackgroundService thread is dead (I can see that by the appBadge not changeing).

---

A side note is also, that normally apps with badges/alerts/sounds etc. are listed under Settings -> Notifications. But I can't get my Titanium app to apear in this list :( Apps using the Locations Service are fine registered under Settings -> Location Services.

   Okay, just got some more info.
   
   I'm using the setInterval in my BackgroundService, and have discovered that the thread is dyeing after exactly 10 minutes, and then it does not recover until you open the app again (but that is just because then the backgroundService is just registered again)</li>

   Rasmus,
   
   Could you please update the ticket with a complete code sample that I can use to test this bug?
   
   Also could you please test using the latest 1.7.3 SDK?
   
   Best regards,
   Matt</li>
