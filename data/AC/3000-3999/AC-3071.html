<h3>Description</h3>

Hi all,
starting to look into memory leak on my app I found a weird behaviour on 1.7.1 that I can see as well in the last build of KitchenSink...

Basically just launching the app, after a bit it seems to start leaking but I can't figured out what exactly... this is happening also on a very simple app that does absolutely nothing if not just opening a window.

Here's a screenshot: <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1751555/Screenshots/3.png" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1751555/Screenshots/3.png</a>

   I can reproduce the same issue, even with a complete new project template.

   the code is exactly the same that TitaniumStudio create by default. Funny thing if I delete everything and leave the whole app.js empty, I still have the same constant leaking.</li>

   As stated, _"Be aware that we will be looking in detail at memory management issues this month."_.
