<h3>Description</h3>

since 1.7.1 the log file is not picked up in my environment. Changeset: <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/commit/9a1b510530c6f529f6d06ff2df5fb3aba36ed268#support/iphone/logger.py" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/commit/9a1b510530c6f529f6d06ff2df5fb3aba36ed268#support/iphone/logger.py</a> 

related ticket: TIMOB-4192

I have a ~/Library/Application Support/iPhone Simulator/4.3.2 folder which is picked up be logger.py. But the actual log file is in ~/Library/Application Support/iPhone Simulator/4.3

I'm not quite sure if this is a bug in logger.py or I screwed up my environment somehow. After removing the "if iphone_version == '4.3':" block from logger.py (or adding a '4.3' to the beginning of the list of supported version) then everything works again.

   Please would you provide the iOS version, xcode version, and the Titanium SDK version (build date and hash) that you have tested?
   
   Also, would you test XCode 4.2/iOS 4.3.3 SDK, and report back on this?
   
   Then we can progress this ticket.
   
   Cheers</li>

   I had some major problem with XCode 4.2, so I won't be able to report back right now. Will do later</li>
