		"description": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI start off by creating a new Window and add a ScrollView to it then add a bunch of labels, buttons and image views to the ScrollView then add the ScrollView to the Window.\r\n\r\nI assign two event listeners, one to an image view and one to a button. With a simple alert(\"clicked1\"); alert(\"clicked2\");\r\n\r\nI run the application click on one of the two views/buttons with the eventlisteners attached and 70% of the time something happens. I close the alert dialog and click on another one and 70% of the time something happens. After clicking on each one once, I am no longer able to click on either of them.\r\n\r\nJust a note: the button does change to a blue gradient when I clicked on it, even though no event is being fired.\r\n\r\nIs there an issue that would make this happen? And is there a way to fix it? I tried using every single event type I can (everything from click to touchmove), same result. I tried it in a ScrollableView, same result.\r\n\r\nOn a regular window (not scrollview or scrollableview) this works as it should. It seems to be only scrollviews/scrollableviews that this occurs. However if I put these buttons/imageviews into a standard View and attach the event listener to that View it still does not work. It seems to be a problem with more then 2 clicks on a eventListener.",
