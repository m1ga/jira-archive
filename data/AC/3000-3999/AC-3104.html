<h3>Description</h3>

If I go to <a href="https://my.appcelerator.com/apps" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://my.appcelerator.com/apps</a> while logged in as fusion94@damagestudios.net I'm getting the standard 404 Aw Shucks page/red screen of death. 

This is making it hard to manage existing apps and get analytics.

   Found that the definer for the geocommons was being called from a location that we removed based on no activity and moving to boostrapper. Added definer back to correct location and pushed to servers. Tested and issue is now resolved.</li>
