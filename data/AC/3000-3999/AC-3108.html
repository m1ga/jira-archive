<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Problem</h4>

Launching newly created project in iOS simulator produces following exception:

<code><pre>
+ TARGET_BUILD_DIR = /Users/mwhite/Documents/Titanium Studio Workspace/com.zytac.tit2/build/iphone/Debug-iphonesimulator

Exception detected in script:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/mwhite/Library/Application Support/Titanium/mobilesdk/osx/1.8.0.1/iphone/builder.py", line 1274, in main
    execute_xcode("iphonesimulator%s" % link_version,["GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS=__LOG__ID__=%s DEPLOYTYPE=development TI_DEVELOPMENT=1 DEBUG=1 TI_VERSION=%s %s %s" % (log_id,sdk_version,debugstr,kroll_coverage)],False)
  File "/Users/mwhite/Library/Application Support/Titanium/mobilesdk/osx/1.8.0.1/iphone/builder.py", line 1202, in execute_xcode
    sys.exit(1)
SystemExit: 1
</pre></code>

If you check the build.py script there is a test at line 1197. xcode will not be invoked if the test fails. I can see from the code that TARGET_BUILD_DIR must be equal to build_dir. HOWEVER in xcode 4.2 I have no idea how to correct TARGET_BUILD_DIR (ENV). The difference can clearly be seen mid string at ".....project/iphone/project....".

It would help if the source of TARGET_BUILD_DIR was documented. Looking at the contents of this string it can only come from Titanium since Xcode can only obtain this string from the <project>.xcodeproj file which is created by Titanium.


<h4>Test case</h4>

Steps to reproduce:

* create a new "Titanium mobile project" in Titanium studio. Use Xcode 4.2.1
* do not add any new code to the project
* build the project using "iPhone Simulator"

<h4>Workaround</h4>

* Open the <project>.xcodeproj file created by Titanium Studio by invoking the Xcode GUI. The compiled project can then be run using Xcode outside of Titanium.

   Have you read [How to Submit a Bug Report](<a href="https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides/How+to+Submit+a+Bug+Report)?" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides/How+to+Submit+a+Bug+Report)?</a> If so, where is the link to the Q&A question you raised? Where is a link to the workaround you mention? Where is your log file?
   
   Once the necessary information is included, I can see if we can escalate this issue.
   
   Thanks</li>

   See ticket TIMOB-2588, which provides a possible solution. If this does not work, then we need to know the steps required in order to reproduce the issue, to be able to accept this ticket.
   
   Thank you</li>
<li>Paul Dowsett 2012-01-02

   btw, it's preferable that you edit the ticket to add missing information, rather than to add it in a comment. Please also try to use the [JIRA Ticket Template](<a href="https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides/JIRA+Ticket+Template)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides/JIRA+Ticket+Template)</a> as a starting point, next time.

   Hi Paul. Ticket TIMOB-2588 differs from my problem. The fragment "build/iphone/build" is identical in both strings expected & was: whereas in my ticket the two strings do not match. I get "build/iphone". 
   
   TIMOB-2588 ticket is to do with case sensitivity "Users" as opposed to "users". In my example Users is correct in both strings.
   
   To reproduce my problem, create a new "Titanium mobile project" in Titanium studio. Note the version of Xcode being used. Do not add any new code. Then build the project using "iPhone Simulator". That will re-produce the problem.
   
   If I launch the Xcode GUI using the .xcodeproj file created by Titanium Studio, I am able to run the project.

   I don't understand this ticket. Where is the error in the attached log?
   
   Would you verify that my changes to the description still describe your situation?
   
   Please, again, read [How to Submit a Bug Report](<a href="https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides/How+to+Submit+a+Bug+Report)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides/How+to+Submit+a+Bug+Report)</a> - following it will prevent delays in getting your ticket escalated now and in future.

   Hi Paul
   
   Near the bottom of the log you will see that TARGET_BUILD_DIR,is output to the log: this (was) string is incorrect. If you check the BUILD_DIR (expected) string it differs as described in my ticket. 
   
   If you check the build.py script there is a test at line 1197. xcode will not be invoked if the test fails. I can see from the code that TARGET_BUILD_DIR must be equal to build_dir. HOWEVER in xcode 4.2 I have no idea how to correct TARGET_BUILD_DIR (ENV). The difference can clearly be seen mid string at ".....project/iphone/project....". Please carefully study my original fault report for this string fragment which I obtained from the Titanium console.
   
   For the work around I suggest this text for more clarity.
   
   Open the <project>.xcodeproj file created by Titanium Studio by invoking the Xcode GUI. The compiled project can then be run using Xcode outside of Titanium.
   
   I will study the HowTo in more detail if I need to submit further tickets using this community. Many thanks for your patience. Unless I can find a way of correcting the TARGET_BUILD_DIR string either in Xcode or in Titanium : this ticket should remain open IMHO.

   I am afraid I need to be able to produce this in order to escalate it. Please would you provide this information?
   
   In the meantime, I will ask internally to see if anyone has any ideas.

    Hello, 
    tried this with Xcode 4.2.x, Lion and Mobile SDK 1.8.1, it's working just fine. 
    
    Best,
