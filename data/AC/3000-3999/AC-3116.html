<h3>Description</h3>

Obtaining XML elements using the following code has

<code><pre>var doc = xhr.responseXML.documentElement;
    
    var items = doc.getElementsByTagName("entry");

    for (var c=0;c<items.length;c++)
    {
        var item = items.item(c);
	var authorname = item.getElementsByTagName("author").item(0).text;
	var authorid = item.getElementsByTagName("authorid").item(0).text;
	var info = item.getElementsByTagName("text").item(0).text;
    }
</pre></code> 

The most recent build of 1.8 and 1.9 starting around December 8 these types of calls now have sporadic functionality.  There is no direct pattern I can pick up yet as to why or which ones do not work, it seems almost random.

The precise error code generated is:

"Result of expression 'item.getElementsByTagName' [undefined] is not a function."

I have checked and made sure the source XML document contains all those XML elements listed, and in fact, with earlier builds of 1.8 or 1.7 this code works perfectly fine on the same exact document.

This issue only affects iOS.  The same code runs just fine on Android with the latest CI builds.

   You should post test example that can be run without any modifications.
   
   
   
   Anyway, your code shouldn't work in any case. In "for" loop you misspelled "items", there is "item" which is undefined variable and you should get "ReferenceException".
   
   
   So, instead of "item" there should be "items[c]".
   
   
   Also, "responseXML.documentElement" sometimes doesn't work on Android, the workaround is to parse XML string from XHR response, something like this:
   
   
   <code><pre>
   var doc = Ti.XML.parseString(xhr.responseXML.toString());
   </pre></code>
   
   
   
   
   Hope this helps.
   
   
   
   Cheers.</li>

   Ivan,
   
   Sorry I forgot one line of code while simplifying it for the ticket.  "var item = items.item(c);" which creates the item variable, i've fixed the code in the original ticket now.
   
   As for responseXML, it seems to be functioning as far as I can tell, as the error that will be thrown may be on the second or third getElementsByTagName request at random.  So for example, var authorname = item.getElementsByTagName("author").item(0).text will work just fine, whereas var info = item.getElementsByTagName("text").item(0).text will not work, or vice versa.
   
   The strange part is that I upload from the CI builds daily, and this has never been an issue until around the December 7-8 1.8.0.1 builds until now.  And my app works primarily using XML data, so the issue was immediatly obvious as a change.  Even right now I can run the app using a December 7 build, and its running great, however using last night's build its broken.</li>

   Ah yes, should be "items.item(c)", I think "items[c]" won't work here (but works in browser).
   
   
   
   Anyway, to increase chance of your ticket's acceptance, you should check this: <a href="http://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides/How+to+Submit+a+Bug+Report" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides/How+to+Submit+a+Bug+Report</a> 
   (if you look around TC, you'll see that there are tickets with great descriptions and test cases and yet are not accepted, so good luck with yours)</li>

   Ivan, thank you.  I will read that over.  Hopefully this is accepted as this is quite real and reproducible as I switch between the builds and between iOS and Android. </li>

   Just another update in the hope that this is addressed.
   
   I have the same identical code, same CI build version (latest 1.9) run between iOS and ANdroid emulators, and the issue still pops up on the iOS version, but not the Android version.  Something is definitely wrong and went wrong around December 7-8

   Maybee these code changes have something to do with it as well, since around this time is when everything broke:  <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/commit/bc6b5fce413c73bc0fb094c301b738dc75e01bcc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/commit/bc6b5fce413c73bc0fb094c301b738dc75e01bcc</a>

   Thank you for raising this ticket.
   
   If you are able to provide all the information described in the [JIRA Ticket Checklist](<a href="http://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides/How+to+Submit+a+Bug+Report#HowtoSubmitaBugReport-JIRATicketChecklist)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides/How+to+Submit+a+Bug+Report#HowtoSubmitaBugReport-JIRATicketChecklist)</a> guidelines, *in the correct fields and using the right format*, I will be able to escalate it to the core team. Please click *edit* to amend the body of the ticket, rather than adding a comment.
   
   As Ivan rightly states, I am afraid I need a test case that runs without modification, which can be used to reproduce the issue and test the resolution once fixed.
   
   I will mark this resolved for now. Please reopen when the ticket is complete.
   
   Thanks in advance.</li>
