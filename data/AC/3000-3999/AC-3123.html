<h3>Description</h3>

The splash screen freezes on the device if:
1) a third-party module (e.g. tested with <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_modules/tree/master/flurry" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_modules/tree/master/flurry</a> and also custom module with no real content) is included in the tiapp.xml file AND
2) the device is connected to a WiFi which cannot access the internet

On the simulator, everything works fine. I have no idea why this is happening, but I tried to clean the build several times and have even created a new plain project tracking down the issue to these 2 points.

   Hi,  
   What version of the flurry module you're using?  </li>
<li>Michael Sauter 2012-08-03

   I'm using 1.3.0 from here: <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_modules/tree/master/flurry/mobile/ios" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_modules/tree/master/flurry/mobile/ios</a>
   
   But ... as I said, it does not seem to be a problem with a specific module, rather with the combination "any module + wifi connected + no internet"</li>

   Hi,
   Could you please attach build.log?</li>

   Hello,
   
   I was wondering if this issue is already processed in a version of titanium mobile. 
   I also noticed this bug: <a href="http://developer.appcelerator.com/question/141994/app-freezes-when-using-accespoint-with-no-internet-connection" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://developer.appcelerator.com/question/141994/app-freezes-when-using-accespoint-with-no-internet-connection</a>
   
   I've exactly the same problem.

   I believe this is related to module verification and not specific to a particular device or module. My understanding is that when you run this application on the simulator, it uses the internet connection of the machine and hence the module verification works. It also works on a device with the internet connection.
   
   [~cbarber] I am not sure how the module verification works if there is no internet connectivity. Can you please provide an insight on how this is supposed to work?</li>

   [~ragrawal] It is my understanding that if you do not have an Internet connection, it will not perform the check.
   
   Just to be clear, we only check for simulator and device builds.
   
   Another thing that can cause a freeze if somehow the app thinks it's being debugged. I would clean the project, uninstall the app, and try again. If it still freezes, it's not a debugging related thing.</li>

   [~cbarber] Thanks for the information.
   [~michaelsauter] We could not reproduce this issue in-house with a custom module and different SDK versions. You may want to clean the project, uninstall the app, and try again. Please let us know if you can reproduce this ticket with the latest SDK version and we would be happy to take another look.</li>
