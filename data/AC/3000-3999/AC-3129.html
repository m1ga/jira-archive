<h3>Description</h3>

The webkit build in Ti Desktop SDK 1.1.0 does not fully support the DOM drag & drop API. The drop event never fires. Although the d&d API comes straight from hell and is a pain to use it's working on the Mac version.

Unfortunately the API is not working in recent versions of Safari/Chrome for Windows either (last that I checked)...

...Just tested on Linux, no drop event there either.

I realize there are bugs in existence for d&d already (marked fixed!), but I'm not allowed to comment on them. So I'm creating a new and more specific one. I can make a testcase if that helps.
