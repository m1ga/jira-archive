<h3>Description</h3>

I made a fresh install of above stated software, and Titanium is completely unable to detect the presence of the iOS SDK from Xcode.

If I install older Xcode 4.0.2 it can see the iOS SDK, but I am getting warnings that KitchenSink can't be built for the iPad, because my version of iOS SDK is < v3.2, which is bizarre since the version of iOS SDK packaged with Xcode 4.0.2 is 4.3.

   Alexander,
   
   Ti Studio has little to do with Xcode, Studio just calls python build scripts in the TiSDK.
   
   You have stated in this ticket the studio version but the SDK is what matters here.
   
   Please update the ticket with the version of the Titanium SDK your using.
   
   Best regards,
   Matt</li>
