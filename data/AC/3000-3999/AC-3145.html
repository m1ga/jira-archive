<h3>Description</h3>

I got an invoice from Appcelerator Marketplace today at the amount of US$ 0.00.

You shouldn't spam me with empty invoices!

   This is not a bug, we do this intentionally. Apple does the same thing when you buy a free app... This is standard industry practice </li>

   I will argue that what Apple does is different. They only send me an invoice when I buy something (free/paid), but you send me an invoice even though I haven't bought anything. Spamming your customers with moot emails is not a good practice, even though you you say it's standard industry practice. Would you display dancing unicorns on your front page if it was standard industry practice?</li>

   when you download a free module, you are buying it, even if the price is free... Or am I misunderstanding? Did you not download a module?</li>

   I did "buy" the Paint module a couple of months ago, but I'm still getting invoices, probably because it's a subscription. I however think this is the wrong thing to do, but if you want to annoy your customers, there doesn't seem to be anything I can do about it...</li>

   Ah I see what your saying...its not just a one time email... your getting it monthly?</li>

   Yes.</li>
