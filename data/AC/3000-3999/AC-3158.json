The issue seems related to somewhat too much strict checks in TiUITextWidgetProxy.m. In particular, a check is performed on [self viewAttached], which resolves to (view != nil && windowOpened). However, in my understanding, the keyboard toolbar lives in a separately managed window with the keyboard view, so there's no mean to notify the subview proxies when that window gets opened or closed.\r\n\r\nIn a project I'm following, I've been able to overcome the problem by relaxing those checks (simply not checking for windowOpened), however this doesn't looks to me as a \"general solution\", as I'm not sure which side effects it might have.\r\n\r\nI attach a test case.\r\nexpected: clicking on the textfield on top of the window should fire the keyboard w/ a toolbar containing another textfield, and focus should be passed to the textfield in the toolbar\r\nCurrent: the keyboard w/ toolbar gets fired but the focus remains on the main textfield.\r\n",
