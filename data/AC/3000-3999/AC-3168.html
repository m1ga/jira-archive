   We have not tested Titanium SDK on Nokia X devices but Titanium applications should work fine on this Android device. Are you running into any specific issue on this device?</li>

   Thanks, Ritu Agrawal
   
   Now I has test on emulator on nokia developer, Titanium has support, but I don't has to test a camera support. And I don't know Titanium SDK has support Here Map too.</li>

   Titanium SDK is officially not supported on Nokia X platform. Titanium SDK relies on a number of Google core apps including Google Maps but Nokia X device does not support Google Maps and other applications so your mileage may vary. There is no immediate plan to support Nokia X series.

   Android as we know it is typically made of two parts; the underlying Android system and the Google apps. The underlying Android system is what the Nokia X runs along with all the usual well known Android phones such as the Samsung Galaxy S range and the HTC One M8.
   Unlike those devices though, the Nokia X does not run Google apps. In order to run Google apps – Gmail, Maps, Calendar, Google Now etc – phones need to be certified. Nokia has not taken this step and it has done so on purpose.
   
   It is most important to note that the Play Store is not available.</li>

   Resolving this as invalid as there is no immediate plan to support Nokia X platform.</li>
