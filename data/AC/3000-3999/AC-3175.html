<h3>Description</h3>

I think it would be very beneficial if you could store a local copy of the Titanium HTML documentation in the Titanium Studio so that if you are developing without an internet connection (i.e. on a flight with no wi-fi) you could get at all the API documentation from within Studio.  I know there are copies on Github but they don't look current and also that is not a seamless way for users to get at the information.  Having it baked into the UI would be very slick and useful.
