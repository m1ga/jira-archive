<h3>Description</h3>

<a href="http://developer.appcelerator.com/questions/newest." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://developer.appcelerator.com/questions/newest.</a> When you search for questions it would be nice to have a sort by feature. Most of the results returned are from 4+ years ago and are no longer relevant.

   Adding other filters like show only questions that have been answered. And other things like that would be helpful as well.</li>

   Hello,
   
   Now we use new Community Q&A: <a href="https://community.appcelerator.com/." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://community.appcelerator.com/.</a> For searching, we may add this two new feature in our community forum.
   
   1. Sort By Date
   2. Filters like show only questions that have been answered.

   Thanks.</li>
