<h3>Description</h3>

As per Titanium document refresh controller is available only for iOS. However, we have a requirement to implement pull to refresh feature in Android also. 

Can you please provide an update if pull to refresh feature can be implemented in Android using any other alternative. Or, would it be possible to add refresh controller for android also.

   As per suggestion for Alan, we tried below two options. Below are our observations.
   
   We have downloaded the module from <a href="https://marketplace.appcelerator.com/apps/8362#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://marketplace.appcelerator.com/apps/8362#</a>!support and tested it. We found that pull to refresh is working. However, it is impacting the display of first item in the list.
   
   With <a href="http://www.oodlestechnologies.com/blogs/Implementing-Pull-to-refresh-(like-in-Facebook-mobile-app)-for-ANDROID-using-Titanium" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.oodlestechnologies.com/blogs/Implementing-Pull-to-refresh-(like-in-Facebook-mobile-app)-for-ANDROID-using-Titanium</a>, we found that pull to refresh is not smooth. Also, the pull to refresh bar does not disappear after the release.
