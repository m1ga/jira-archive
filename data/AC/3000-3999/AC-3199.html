<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Steps to Reproduce</h4>
I have seen the notice that Titanium is being discontinued and am doing my best to move my current Titanium Studio project over to Appcelerator Studio but:

1) Cannot login to JIRA from Appcelerator Studio using my Titanlum credentials.

2) Cannot work out how to claim my free indie seat.

My Titanium Studio username is bill.noble@vardas.com

<h4>Actual Result</h4>
Bad Credentiials

<h4>Expected Result</h4>
Successful login

   Hello, I tried to signed up your account in [here](<a href="http://www.appcelerator.com/)." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.appcelerator.com/).</a> Looks like you already did that. Can you log in to Appcelerator dashboard web portal?. If so, from there you need to select Manage Billing from the drop down menu of your account. From there you can choose indie package. Follow these steps. Hope this helps. Reply after trying.
   
   Thanks.</li>

   Why does platform.appcelerator.com keep asking me for an authorisation ID when I have previously successfully given it one?
   
   I have thought managed to setup my free indie account. Thanks.</li>
