<h3>Description</h3>

When I was app developing on Titanium SDK 3.2.3, I was using a custom theme with the parent Theme.Holo.Light. However, after I updated to 3.4.0, we were forced to change the parent theme Theme.AppCompat.Light. Before the change, the color of the searchbar text was black, and it worked fine with the white navigation bar. Now, the color of the text is white, which is almost invisible with the current theme. There is currently no way to change this through Titanium.
