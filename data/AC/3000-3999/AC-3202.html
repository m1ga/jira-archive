<h3>Description</h3>

I would like to know if Appcelerator will finally incorporate any option to view flash files in  a webView which is really the thing why many of us are interested to create apps for android. Because we can run flash files like panoramas on www.virtualnezahorie.sk on android with no problem (in browser) but how about webView? it's just not working.

Is there any workaround this time or will it be available any time in near future ? 

thanks

   Would you please provide some simple code to prove that it does not work currently, with the full log showing any exceptions?
   
   Note that the Adobe flash plugin may need to be installed, if it does not already exist on the device. See [Flash Player 10.1 for Android 2.2 Release Notes](<a href="http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/860/cpsid_86018.html)." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/860/cpsid_86018.html).</a>
   
   Once this is done, I can progress the ticket.
   
   Cheers</li>

   After discussion with core team:
   
   {panel:bgColor=#F2FCC9}
   Note that It won't work in the emulators at all
   
   It will only work on 2.2 devices and greater.
   
   The API to enable it looks to be API 8. We currently do not have plugins enabled at all at [TiUIWebView.java](<a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/blob/master/android/modules/ui/src/ti/modules/titanium/ui/widget/webview/TiUIWebView.java#L61)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/blob/master/android/modules/ui/src/ti/modules/titanium/ui/widget/webview/TiUIWebView.java#L61)</a> if we can get test code it should be easy to add the code to enable it.
   
   They can simply change the tooling level to API 8 if they want. To do this, configure tiapp.xml with <tool-api-level>8</tool-api-level> and <manifest><uses-sdk android:minSdkVersion="8"/></manifest> to set Android 2.2 as the min. OS version
