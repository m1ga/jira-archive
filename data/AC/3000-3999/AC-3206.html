<h3>Description</h3>

Through the Android NDK, it is possible to run the V8 JavaScript engine from Chromium. The V8 JS engine is *much* faster than current Rhino, and many users are disappointed with Titanium Android performance. Definitely not "native". V8 is also faster than JSC on iOS. I am proposing that Titanium Mobile on Android will use V8 instead of Rhino. This tweet (<a href="http://twitter.com/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://twitter.com/#</a>!/kevinwhinnery/status/93078519927676928) suggests that this work is underway, but I would like to add it to the tracker so the community can follow the progress.

   I'm sorry for the confusion, but there are no plans to move to V8 at this time. If this changes, it will be announced via the [Developer Blog](<a href="http://developer.appcelerator.com/blog)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://developer.appcelerator.com/blog)</a>, just like all our official news, and not via a casual tweet.
   
   Thanks</li>

   Will there be plans to move to V8 in the future? That would be very good for the platform.</li>

   We won't use Ti for Android until the performance is on par with native Android.  The performance of Rhino is not acceptable to us.  Please reconsider going to V8.</li>

   Please add V8, right now Ti android apps feel slower then their Ti iOS counterparts.</li>

   Thank you for your comments. Work is being done to move to v8 in a future release.</li>

   If you are planning on moving to V8, then this bug shouldn't be marked as "Won't Fix".</li>

   Ticket resolved and not updated since last curator action.</li>
