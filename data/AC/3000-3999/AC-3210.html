<h3>Description</h3>

It would be great to be able to hide the keyboard (soft on android) for a view and all its subviews.
That way you dont have to know the focused view.
You could for example do it for a window

   It might be because it's late in the day, but I'm not sure I understand exactly what you mean. Could you perhaps add more information and explain this better? Perhaps some pseudo example code? Thanks.</li>

   I've set this to resolved so that the issue can now be edited to provide more info.
   Thanks,

   Can't reproduce this: if you keep an array with a reference to the textviews in the windows, you can blur them out programatically. </li>
