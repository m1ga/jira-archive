<h3>Description</h3>

Please enable the [setCustomView API](<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/ActionBar.html#setCustomView%28android.view.View%29)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/ActionBar.html#setCustomView%28android.view.View%29)</a> for Android ActionBar.This includes the getter as well, and the enabling function [setDisplayShowCustomEnabled](<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/ActionBar.html#setDisplayShowCustomEnabled%28boolean%29)." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/ActionBar.html#setDisplayShowCustomEnabled%28boolean%29).</a>
This API is "parity" for iOS, where Ti support titleImage and titleControl for the iOS nav bar.
NOTE: upon further checks, I don't think it's possible to reach parity with iOS - i.e. have views, images, etc in the ActionBar and keep tabbed navigation.

   @Mark, I just recently saw a ticket for full actionbar support so this may be a duplicate. Let me try and find it and I will get back to you.

   @Mark, I am not quite sure what you mean by parity. The android actionbar is OS specific. There is no actionbar on iOS. Can you please be more specific? Marking invalid until further details provided.

   It's OK - kill this ticket. There's no question that what needs to happen is full action bar support, and in my opinion a compatibility library for older Android versions is pretty much standard in Android today - Ti needs to keep up with this. What I meant by "parity" is that the iOS tab bar/ nav bar has lots more functionality than what is exposed by Ti for Android tabs/action bar, despite that the action bar is actually very flexible, and this area of the SDK should be looked at - just my opinion on it.
   Thanks for the time to look into all this!

   Mark, I agree, I believe engineering is making progress on trying to implement and support more actionbar support. If you do a quick search you can go through the new feature requests and improvement requests that have come in regarding actionbar. If what you need is not already being worked on, please feel free to create a new ticket suggesting more features be available. 
   Thanks for you suggestions and feedback, closing ticket,
   Carter</li>
