<h3>Description</h3>

Hi. I have no idea how's the path to submit a patch to Titanium. But some weeks ago I've added Proximity Events support to iOS.

I've forked the repository on github, created a branch, added the code and submitted the pull request.

The pull request URL is here: <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/175" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/175</a>

I want you to please guide me completing the pull request, adding anything that's missing.

   Hi Ruben
   
   Thanks for this ticket, and your offer to contribute some code. In order for us to accept any code, you must be familiar with the information in the  [Contributing Code](<a href="http://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides/Contributing+to+Titanium#ContributingtoTitanium-ContributingCode)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides/Contributing+to+Titanium#ContributingtoTitanium-ContributingCode)</a> guide. That section describes the CLA and the process of submitting code via github.
   
   You will also need to supply a usecase that demonstrates your new functionality, so that it is obvious how it works. You can add this in a markup code block to the body of this ticket.
   
   Once this is done, I can move the ticket across so the core team can process the pull request. Thankfully, now that you know what is required, any future submissions are likely to be a lot easier. :)
   
   Thank you in advance

   Hi Paul! thank you for your reply!
   
   I eventually discovered that the functionality I submitted through github already existed on the titanium mobile codebase, so I closed my ticket, and I think you can close this ticket too.
   
   I will read the Contributing Code guide for future submissions :) Thank you very much!</li>
