<h3>Description</h3>

ListView rows appear separated by a black line under Android.

Until separatorColor property is implemented (should be back into v1 in my opinion, as many real apps change it), the default color of the thin line between rows should be light gray as in iOS.

   Banzai,
   The stock color of the listViewRow separator is black on android (see attached pic). We try to keep android and iOS native qualities as consistent as possible. Having the separator line consistent with the native functionality ensures the native feel of the app. This is the reason why the android listViewRow seperator color will not be the same as the iOS and vice versa.
   Thank you for your suggestion,
   Carter</li>

   Ok Carter,
   I see your point. 
   
   Any hope of having separatorColor property in 3.1 GA ?
   Our apps are all strictly customized to established brand colors, so we can't take advantage of the huge performance leap of ListViews until then...

   I understand the need for a separatorColor, would you like to create a ticket for new feature request or improvement request? I will review and pass along to engineering if so. 
   Thanks,
   Carter</li>
