<h3>Description</h3>

I created an Alloy widget (right click > New > Alloy Widget). Then under assets I created a subfolder called categories then a subfolder called error so it looks like ASSETS > CATEGORIES > ERROR. I was trying to access a file in the error directory called error.png but it kept coming up blank. So I looked in the resources directory and the directory structure seemed backwards. See the image attached. It was essentially RESOURCES > CATEGORIES > ERROR > COM.[widget name] > error.png

It's a little counterintuitive. Could each widget not have their own directory structure instead of sharing?

   The reason it is structured in this manner is so that you can take advantage of Titanium's platform-specific folders. If they are structured in this way, you can easily make use of the android, iphone, and mobileweb folders with a widget while still preventing the chance of filename collisions.</li>
