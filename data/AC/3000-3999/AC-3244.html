<h3>Description</h3>

You should enable voting on JIRA, so the community can show which issues that are important to us.

   watching the ticket is how you "vote" in jira.</li>

   Why? They aren't mutually exclusive. Sometimes I want to watch something, but I don't want it prioritized, other times I want to vote on something, but I don't want to be spammed with updates.
   
   There is a reason JIRA has both vote and watch built-in!

   I do understand your point that voting serves a different purpose, in that it reduces the clutter in your inbox. However, we took a conscious decision to use the watch facility exclusively, despite the extra costs (bandwidth and resources) that it creates for us. This is because the watch list gives us a single measurement of how important a ticket is to our community, which is very easy for us to query. Furthermore, there is no ambiguity about its definition, which would exist if voting was enabled. If an issue is not important enough for our users to need to keep informed of its progress, then it is not the type of ticket that we can disregard all other considerations in order to prioritize it.
   
   I hope you can appreciate that voting was certainly not disabled without extensive deliberation.
   
   Thanks for your understanding.</li>

   I just found this today and was not clear about the fact that watching is voting in this JIRA instance - would be great if you placed information about this feature on a prominent place so more people start using it! Thanks for your attention!</li>

   I would recommend the default "Introduction" area in the JIRA dashboard as a good place for this information - it should replace the default text:
   _You must register and login if you want to create, comment, *vote, or watch* issues._
