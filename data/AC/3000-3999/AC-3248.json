		"description": "h3. Steps to Reproduce\nUsing Mobile Web more, as the request for app development has been lagging behind requests for web based solutions, not having the ability to track the cursor's position or listen for rollover events is keeping me from using Studio for desktop/laptop websites. At the very least, shouldn't the 'focus' event work for a window? Not only does it not seem to respond to rollovers but clicking a window doesn't bring it into focus, so what does? A mousemove event could also work if I calculate mouse.x/mouse.y but none of these are available. Any chance you're working on it or intend to? Otherwise I'll be forced to move away from the product and I don't want to, I love it, but the job market will not allow and laptops aren't going to disapper.\n\nh3. Actual Result\nI haven't found a solution anywhere.\n\nh3. Expected Result\nYou'll find a way.",

Because mobile devices generally do NOT have a mouse, there's no need for rollover, hover, or mousemove events.\r\n\r\nTitanium Mobile Web does support focusing elements, but these are generally fired by non-input based actions such as opening a window, which fires the focus window event. Clicking on a window does not focus it.\r\n\r\nI would love to fix Titanium Mobile Web to add support for desktop browsers, however that probably won't happen anytime soon. :(",
