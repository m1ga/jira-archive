<h3>Description</h3>

I have 7 reviews added from various users created with ACS. One user has been deleted, still leaving their reviews in ACS. 
I have an admin account that cannot delete any of these reviews. 
Logging onto Appcelerator website, going to manage the ACS app - a link to the reviews shows (Reviews 7), but nothing appears on the page. 
I have been in conversation with Wei the Director of Engineering, Cloud Service, who has been helpful but I need this escalated to an official stance from Appcelerator. At the moment as ACS is I cannot release my APP live. I need a way of managing reviews - to me this is a fundamental flaw in how reviews are a feature on ACS.

   Peter, can you pleae take a look?</li>
<li>Peter Lee 2012-05-14

   Hi Ian, you have to search for the data type which review(comment) was linked to.
   i.e) if you have created a review(comment) on a post, should search for the posts under search box, then there will the result of posts with reviews. Select the post that has the review you want to modify/delete, then it will show the list of reviews.
   Yes, there is ui flaw, review UI will be updated soon.
   
   Sorry about this.</li>

   Right. Thats ok. I can see them, which to be fair I could by other means. But even when logged in as an admin, there is not ability to be able to delete the review. I can't even delete them with command line. 
   
   Now, i'm clutching at straws here, but the test user that created the reviews I have in the system is deleted. Perhaps I should have deleted the reviews they created first, but thats not the point, and ADMIN should still be able to delete a review made by another user. Even make it offline? A moderation system would be cool too, but I don't want to ask for too much.
   
   If your interested the app is: 4d8282c4-0bf8-4023-98c0-4914a79f2888 - If I am right then, could we organise the reviews on associated on that app key be deleted?</li>
<li>Peter Lee 2012-05-14

   Ok, trying to get the problem right here,
   
   >> the test user that created the reviews I have in the system is deleted.
   
   does this mean you have deleted the user(owner of review), which is now no longer inherit to user. And the review can't be deleted, right?</li>
<li>Ian Tearle 2012-05-14

   That is the case.
   The test user was a test user as I built the app. I had an admin user that I assumed would be able to delete anything whatever, but perhaps I deleted the user in the wrong order. 
   
   In summary: you are correct.
   
   Im guessing this obviously makes a difference.</li>

   The issue is a problem from api side, which when user is deleted then all the related(linked) data will dumped, but this could take some times.
   Linked to related related issue.
   
   Sorry about the inconvenience.</li>
<li>Ian Tearle 2012-05-14

   I have just posted and deleted a review with an admin account - and using your method to search for the reviews it has worked. I've not tested with a non admin account as yet.
   
   If that is the case, which it appears to be, how is one able to remove the objects which do not have an associated user?</li>
<li>Ian Tearle 2012-05-14

   Oops, crossed messages there. 
   
   So are you saying that there is a delay on the dump of related(linked) data? </li>
<li>Wei Kong 2012-05-14

   We will fix our backend to allow this but in the meantime, if you wish to delete any reviews that don't have current users, we can help you delete them manually but send us the review ids.</li>
<li>Peter Lee 2012-05-14

    When the user is deleted, what is supposed to happen is that all the linked data(which was created under that user) will be deleted. And this process will go through delayed job.</li>
<li>Wei Kong 2012-05-16

    Ok deleted.</li>

    Closing: Assumed fixed.</li>
