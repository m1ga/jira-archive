		"description": "I have 7 reviews added from various users created with ACS. One user has been deleted, still leaving their reviews in ACS. \r\nI have an admin account that cannot delete any of these reviews. \r\nLogging onto Appcelerator website, going to manage the ACS app - a link to the reviews shows (Reviews 7), but nothing appears on the page. \r\nI have been in conversation with Wei the Director of Engineering, Cloud Service, who has been helpful but I need this escalated to an official stance from Appcelerator. At the moment as ACS is I cannot release my APP live. I need a way of managing reviews - to me this is a fundamental flaw in how reviews are a feature on ACS.",

I can't even delete them with command line. \r\n\r\nNow, i'm clutching at straws here, but the test user that created the reviews I have in the system is deleted. Perhaps I should have deleted the reviews they created first, but thats not the point, and ADMIN should still be able to delete a review made by another user. Even make it offline? A moderation system would be cool too, but I don't want to ask for too much.\r\n\r\nIf your interested the app is: 4d8282c4-0bf8-4023-98c0-4914a79f2888 - If I am right then, could we organise the reviews on associated on that app key be deleted?",
