<h3>Description</h3>

It is very difficult as developers to know which features are supported by each platform when building Android / iOS apps, and I'm sure this problem will be compounded when Blackberry support is released.

I really think a matrix of supported features by API call would make life a lot easier for everyone, something like <a href="http://www.phonegap.com/about/features/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.phonegap.com/about/features/</a> would be great.  Failing that, at least a little indicator in the documentation which shows which platforms are supported would be useful.

   We are already working on a plan for this, Matthew. Thank you for your concern, but there is no need for you to raise tickets for this type of "issue" as it is being tracked internally.
   
   Thank you for your understanding.</li>

   Once again, without visibility into what is happening internally, there is no way for me to know if this is something you are addressing or not.  So saying there is no reason to raise an "issue" like this is a bit unfair as I have chatted with numerous other developers about this issue, and they all see it as a serious concern and problem day to day when doing cross platform development.</li>

   We appreciate that you took the time to raise a ticket, and I am in no way critisising you for doing so. I was just trying to explain the reason why I was closing it, rather than closing it without one.
   
   Sorry that this was not clear.
   
   Cheers</li>

   Closing due to inactivity.</li>
