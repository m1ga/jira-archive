<h3>Description</h3>

I am using Titanium : 3.1.3 SDK. and developing applications on IOS7 and android 4.2. I am following Alloy MVC framework in my developement. I would like to know if it is possible to support multiple views with one controller. Consider the below scenario.:-I have 2 countries. I have a base controller and a view. From the base controller, I need to open different views for different countries but both the child views should have the same controller.
Example:-
From BaseController.js I would like to open ChildController_US.xml for USA and childController_UK.xml for UK.I would like to have 1 single controller childController.js

   It would be great if you can provide a code sample (does not need to work obviously) that demonstrates how the requested feature would be used. We can then evaluate this feature request more meaningfully.</li>
