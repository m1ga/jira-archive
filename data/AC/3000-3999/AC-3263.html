<h3>Description</h3>

Is it possible to add a center point to views for MobileWeb?

Trying to place visual items by their center point after the resizing of browser windows currently requires a division of a parent's height/width and a subtraction of the item's height/width, which fails if either is set to a percentage, SIZE, FILL or auto. Alternate methods are super lengthy, requiring the manual re-sizing of every item according to current dimensions and it gets quite complex when coupled with multiple elements moving and scaling. This is a shame because such a basic necessity limits me from creating more dynamic, visually interesting websites.

Is it just not possible?
