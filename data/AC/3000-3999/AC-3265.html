   hi there--any updates on this?  It's urgent as we are trying to move forward with Windows development (depending on the response we get back from you), so would appreciate a response ASAP.
   
   Thank you in advance.

   Hello,
   you will be able to create apps for Windows Phones with 8.1, and will be able to run Appc Studio in Windows 8.1. 
   
   The only part not integrated is the uploading with the store. But you can open the project in your Visual Studio 2013 Community edition and will be able to publish.
   
   I recomment to read this post:

   Which is the latest preview.
   
   Just remember: This is a technical preview, i.e., It's a work in progress. Therefore, your mileage will vary.

   Hi Mauro
   
   Thanks for responding--so just to be clear if we start working on the windows app tomorrow, will it create the app for 8.1 or is that still a work in progress between Appcelerator and Windows?  Just trying to understand your comment of 'you will be'
   
   Also, I know there is no guarantee-but is there any timeline as to the full release?</li>

   Hello,
   if you use the latest preview, will work just fine. You might find bugs and you are more than welcome to report them, but we can't guarantee the speed for fixing them. 
   
   To be clear: Yes, you will be able to create the app for windows 8.1 and you will be able to deploy it to a device within Visual Studio 2013. You can use VS 2013 Community if you don't have access to the VS 2013 Pro or Ultimate. 
   
   The upload to the store will need to happen within VS 2013. 
   
   We don't have a public roadmap yet for the full release. 
   
   Best Regards</li>
