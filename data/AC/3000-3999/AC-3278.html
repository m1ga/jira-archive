   Hi linzuxiong,
   
   Can you tell me whether you also have any issue with the speed of our site, [<a href="http://wiki.appcelerator.org" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://wiki.appcelerator.org</a>]?
   
   Thank you</li>

   linzuxiong,
   
   I have liaised with one of the heads of our IT teams who has assured me that we have not had any reports of problems from other users, and thus must assume that an issue exists in your environment. I am afraid that unless we have evidence that the problem is more widespread, then we cannot really take this ticket further.
   
   However, we can suggest that you use general troubleshooting techniques to deduce the cause.  For example:
   * try accessing other websites, to determine whether the problems you have with our jira server is an isolated case
   * log in from a different computer on your network
   * log in from a different computer on a different network
   
   There are certainly more comprehensive tests you can do from your own network, but I regret that this is out of the scope of what we do. 
   
   Good luck; I hope you are able to find the fix.
   
   Thanks
