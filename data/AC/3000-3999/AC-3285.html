<h3>Description</h3>

We'd like to have a seamless ACS Account creation by email confirmation and login.

When a New User Account is created, the confirmation_template Email is being sent to the New Accounts email address. In the email, when the confirmation button is clicked it *opens our app and passes the token to our App via URL Schemes in order to make the Confirmation call*:

 However, when we confirm the Account with the token, we *do not get back the ACS User Object*, more importantly the session_id in order to automatically login to the App.

This API:
GET <a href="https://api.cloud.appcelerator.com/v1/users/confirm_user.json?confirmation_token=zzzbbb&key=xxxxyyyy" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://api.cloud.appcelerator.com/v1/users/confirm_user.json?confirmation_token=zzzbbb&key=xxxxyyyy</a>

Sends back ok, only.

Ideally, when the email is confirmed, the User Object would be returned with the session_id. This way we can login the user immediately into the app and not have them re-enter their user/pass in order to get the session_id and login for further ACS calls.

Workaround:
- After Confirmation, the user must enter their username/password they used when they created the account.
