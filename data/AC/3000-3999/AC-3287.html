<h3>Description</h3>

I am pulling my hair out trying to figure out how to use the Android emulator in the best way, and the documentation is not accurate or up to date.

I've tried launching the emulator from the command line, along with launching the app using the command line (following the Fastdev instructions at <a href="http://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides/Fastdev+Reference+for+Android)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides/Fastdev+Reference+for+Android)</a> and I get erratic behaviour where my app is said to be unresponsive and needs to be force closed.

I've then tried launching from within Titanium Studio, but having an emulator started manually using Android AVD, and sometimes it works, sometimes Titanium Studio launches another emulator, sometimes it does not work at all.  I don't seem to be able to see any API.info/error/warn messages, and the debugger works intermittently.  When I don't start an emulator manually, then Titanium Studio kills the emulator after each use, meaning it's 5 minutes to get going each time.

When I look at the documentation at <a href="http://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides/Testing+your+Applications#TestingyourApplications-RunEmulator" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides/Testing+your+Applications#TestingyourApplications-RunEmulator</a>, it is completely out of date and shows the old Titanium Studio, so this no longer applies.

Surely there is an approved / mandated way to work with the Android emulator which allows the emulator to be launched on its own to reduce start up times, and Titanium Studio can push Android apps to the emulator?

Please can you document a stable process somewhere so that myself and everyone else knows what should be done when working with Android.

At present, I have just given up with Android and will hopefully return when this has been addressed.  I've tried the Q&A area (<a href="http://developer.appcelerator.com/question/123965/android-emulator---working-process-and-fastdev-question)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://developer.appcelerator.com/question/123965/android-emulator---working-process-and-fastdev-question)</a> and had no luck, and I've been on the IRC channel and not had a response.

   We are working on bringing the Documentation Guides up to date and a complete overhaul of the APIDocs. There is some work that needs to be in place beforehand though, which is holding us up. Please bear with us.
   
   In the meantime, please see the documentation on using [Titanium Studio](<a href="http://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/tis)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/tis)</a>, which is up to date.
   
   There is no need to raise tickets for this type of "issue" - we are very well aware of the urgent need internally.
   
   Thank you for your patience.</li>

   Tracked internally.</li>

   Ok Paul.
   
   Please understand though that if there is no ticket for it, and I am not aware of your plans, then things like this are problems that do need to be addressed.
   
   And in terms of the "process" to run, and debug applications, there really is not much in the Titanium Studio documentation either, although admittedly I had not looked there before.
   
   Reassuring to know that this is a priority internally.  Good luck.
