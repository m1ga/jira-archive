		"description": "I am pulling my hair out trying to figure out how to use the Android emulator in the best way, and the documentation is not accurate or up to date.\r\n\r\nI've tried launching the emulator from the command line, along with launching the app using the command line (following the Fastdev instructions at http://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides/Fastdev+Reference+for+Android) and I get erratic behaviour where my app is said to be unresponsive and needs to be force closed.\r\n\r\nI've then tried launching from within Titanium Studio, but having an emulator started manually using Android AVD, and sometimes it works, sometimes Titanium Studio launches another emulator, sometimes it does not work at all.  I don't seem to be able to see any API.info/error/warn messages, and the debugger works intermittently.  When I don't start an emulator manually, then Titanium Studio kills the emulator after each use, meaning it's 5 minutes to get going each time.\r\n\r\nWhen I look at the documentation at http://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides/Testing+your+Applications#TestingyourApplications-RunEmulator, it is completely out of date and shows the old Titanium Studio, so this no longer applies.\r\n\r\nSurely there is an approved / mandated way to work with the Android emulator which allows the emulator to be launched on its own to reduce start up times, and Titanium Studio can push Android apps to the emulator?\r\n\r\nPlease can you document a stable process somewhere so that myself and everyone else knows what should be done when working with Android.\r\n\r\nAt present, I have just given up with Android and will hopefully return when this has been addressed.  I've tried the Q&A area (http://developer.appcelerator.com/question/123965/android-emulator---working-process-and-fastdev-question) and had no luck, and I've been on the IRC channel and not had a response.\r\n\r\nMatt\r\n",
