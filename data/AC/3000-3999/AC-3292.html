<h3>Description</h3>

Currently, when a new project is created a set of images with the Appcelerator branding is created for the splash screens and icons. I can't think of a use case where an app would be released with these graphics and so they serve no purpose. Can we please just create plain white or totally blank images instead.

Thanks

   Neville,
   Thank you for the suggestion but the splash screens serve a purpose for new developers and those testing with Titanium to understand the concept of a splash screen. Though android apps dont necessarily need a splash screen (some have adopted it to stay consistent with their iOS counter parts), the vast majority of iPhone apps have them as a loading screen. To show the role and importance of splash screens is the reason for having the default Appcelerator splash screen. It is used as an example for its purpose. A white or blank screen would not show the concept of a splash screen as clearly as the default one does. I hope this explanation is understandable and thank you again for your feedback. Any other questions or concerns, feel free to ask.
   Regards,
   Carter </li>

   Thanks for the explanation. But I think pretty much all devs are aware of the splash screens. Additionally, the iOS UI guidelines advocate the splash being used to make app loading appear faster and it specifically dis-courages a sort of app branding splash screen. So what Ti is showing as an example is very poor practice.

   So according to Apple's [Human Interface Guidelines](<a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/Introduction/Introduction.html):" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/Introduction/Introduction.html):</a>
   
   {quote}Display a launch image that closely resembles the first screen of the application. This practice decreases the perceived launch time of your application.{quote}
   
   {quote}Avoid displaying an About window or a splash screen. In general, try to avoid providing any type of startup experience that prevents people from using your application immediately.{quote}
   
   Despite this, it remains as a Won't Fix because it's totally up to the end user on how they customise the splash screen. Our Appcelerator branded splash screen is a crystal clear placeholder for app-specific customisation later on. To emphasise Carter's point, if the splash screen was simply white the user wouldn't even know where the transition between the splash screen and the window itself is.</li>

   Thanks Daniel.
   
   Just to be clear I am not suggesting that the demo apps and Kitchen sink etc are changed. They are exactly the place to show to a user the transition and how a Ti app works.
   
   I am just suggesting that by the time a user graduates from looking at demos they are fully aware of splash screens and don't need it re-iterated to them. So I am suggested that the new app templates are changed.</li>

   Neville,
   
   I just spoke with a member from engineering about this. There are currently no plans to change the default splash screens from the current new app template as they are easily discarded by those experienced developers that you have pointed out. However, if you would like to create a new ticket to propose a new template, one in which there is no splash screen (rather than changing the existing one) then I would be glad to pass it along to engineering for them to review. This way there can be a default app template which shows the use for a splash screen, and one for experienced developers that is just a bare bones template. I believe this is what you were suggesting in your last comment?
   
   Thanks for your suggestions, I hope a middle ground can be reached on this for you. We appreciate your cooperation.

   Carter. That sounds like a plan. Thank you</li>
