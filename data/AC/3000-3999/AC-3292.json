Though android apps dont necessarily need a splash screen (some have adopted it to stay consistent with their iOS counter parts), the vast majority of iPhone apps have them as a loading screen. To show the role and importance of splash screens is the reason for having the default Appcelerator splash screen. It is used as an example for its purpose. A white or blank screen would not show the concept of a splash screen as clearly as the default one does. I hope this explanation is understandable and thank you again for your feedback. Any other questions or concerns, feel free to ask.\nRegards,\nCarter ",

Additionally, the iOS UI guidelines advocate the splash being used to make app loading appear faster and it specifically dis-courages a sort of app branding splash screen. So what Ti is showing as an example is very poor practice.\n",

In general, try to avoid providing any type of startup experience that prevents people from using your application immediately.{quote}\n\nDespite this, it remains as a Won't Fix because it's totally up to the end user on how they customise the splash screen. Our Appcelerator branded splash screen is a crystal clear placeholder for app-specific customisation later on. To emphasise Carter's point, if the splash screen was simply white the user wouldn't even know where the transition between the splash screen and the window itself is.",

They are exactly the place to show to a user the transition and how a Ti app works.\n\nI am just suggesting that by the time a user graduates from looking at demos they are fully aware of splash screens and don't need it re-iterated to them. So I am suggested that the new app templates are changed.",

					"body": "Neville,\n\nI just spoke with a member from engineering about this. There are currently no plans to change the default splash screens from the current new app template as they are easily discarded by those experienced developers that you have pointed out. However, if you would like to create a new ticket to propose a new template, one in which there is no splash screen (rather than changing the existing one) then I would be glad to pass it along to engineering for them to review. This way there can be a default app template which shows the use for a splash screen, and one for experienced developers that is just a bare bones template. I believe this is what you were suggesting in your last comment?\n\nThanks for your suggestions, I hope a middle ground can be reached on this for you. We appreciate your cooperation.\n\nRegards,\nCarter",
