<h3>Description</h3>

With the addition of <code>show_user_like : Boolean</code> is a great addition to be used in many different scenarios behind the scene, though for a Query of Users to see if each User is a friend to the Current User that Queried is a little more complicated.

Currently a loop needs to be cycled on the mobile App side, in to check if each user is a friend with an existing cached array of Friends. A similar property to show_user_like would improve performance by a lot for such Friendship scenarios.

   With <code>_.intersection([userId1, userId2, userId3], [userId101, userId2, userId1, userId10]);</code>
   
   Results => [userId1, userId2]
   
   I've found to be the most straight forward with underscorejs... maybe we could omit... not very important... but helpful :) 
   This method also forces the App to store the FreindsIds array.</li>

   Hi,
   
   Thank you for your suggestion, Although I don't really understand what is the meaning of <code>show_user_like</code> and what is its usage.
   
   Could you please explain it in detail, or maybe a example will be helpful.
   
   Thanks</li>

   Hi Shuo, <code>show_user_like</code> already exists, you can find it in the documentation here: <a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/cloud/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/cloud/latest/#</a>!/api/Users-method-query
   
   What I was suggesting is to add another property which is <code>user_is_freind</code>, which would also be a boolean, in order for the current user that Queries Users, to know that a User is already a Friend or not.</li>

   Oh, I see.
   
   Actually our cloud team has worked on the same issues, and your advice is quite useful. 
   I think they will finish this improvement as soon as possible. 
   
   Thank you again for your suggestion.</li>
