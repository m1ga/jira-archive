		"description": "This is a pro-services project where we download a lot of files between a server and the app.\r\nWe've seem to be running into performance of this downloading that doesn't seem to match the expectations. \r\nWe were running into memory related issues at one point and we've recently applied some fixes to the SDK code to resolve this so that we no longer get \"out of memory\" issues and no longer get the Android/JAVA 'pausing' when its doing garbage collection. However, this still hasn't sped put the time to download all of these files by any significant amount.\r\n\r\nWe need to figure out what things we can do to speed up this process to include if we try to make sdk changes or a module that allows us to better do simultaneous file downloading without problems on the native side. Or another ideas/things that platform team can help guide us on.\r\n\r\nContact me to get access to the codebase for the app for platform team developer.\r\n\r\n",

The project that this occurred on did go into production with a fix from us by creating our own HTTP module for downloading files which added the ability to save files directly to the file from the native side and avoided having the file content transferred to javascript side (just as the iOS side does with its file option). This improved the issue but I don't remember if all aspects of the download slowdown were resolved completely.",
