   Hello, I can't understand why you don't want to use store-kit module for iOS in app purchases. It got great review in the marketplace. There are currently no other module for iOS in app purchases. [StoreKit In-App Purchasing (iOS)](<a href="https://marketplace.appcelerator.com/apps/7161?restoreSearch=true#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://marketplace.appcelerator.com/apps/7161?restoreSearch=true#</a>!overview) by Logical Labs is the best there is. Or else you need to develop your own module. Hope this helps, Thanks. </li>
