<h3>Description</h3>

We were getting PUSH Notification properly on device, bust since last few days, we are not receiving every time. Notification message are available on ACS Push Notification Log but not delivered to device.

One More thing, Device subscription mapping with User Subscription are not upto date. A number of mappings are missing.
Is there any issue with ACS Push Notification.

We are using Titanium SDK 3.2.0, GCM for Android.
