<h3>Description</h3>

Hi Mauro,

We are planning to build our all the ipad and iphone app in appcelerator.
I have some questions that can stop us in the middle of the development for appcelerator.

Can you please take out some time and go through my queries.
It will be great if you can just mention whether all this thing are possible in appcelerator or not?


Below are the queries listed.


1. Native Platform support: In case inbetween we may have to implement native code
2. Security asymmetric and a symmetric cryptology
SSL /TLS network communication supported or not with Certificate authority and without Certificate authority.
3. Runtime Exception handling 
4. Local data storage, session, cookies,cache etc 
5. Image compression on device level
6. Backup / Restore: In case if page crashes than can we store in backup file in devices?
7. Device storage for IOS

Thanks in advance.

Thanks,
Dhaval

   Hello!
   
   1. Native Platform support: In case inbetween we may have to implement native code - Yes, you have the option to create native modules. 
   2. Security asymmetric and a symmetric cryptology - Yes you can, there are several ways to accomplish this, it depends on what you actually need. 
   
   SSL /TLS network communication supported or not with Certificate authority and without Certificate authority. - Yes, there is SSL support/ 
   3. Runtime Exception handling - Yes, you can catch issues and act accordingly.  
   4. Local data storage, session, cookies,cache etc  - Yes, you have some of this. But the apps ARE NOT HTML5. It's different. 
   5. Image compression on device level - Yes, with modules. 
   6. Backup / Restore: In case if page crashes than can we store in backup file in devices? - What do you mean with page crashes? 
   7. Device storage for IOS - Yes, you can store data either in files or sqlite databases.
