<h3>Description</h3>

I am trying to 'run' the simulator to view the app and I get the error message: There are no Xcode installations found that are supported by Titanium sdk 3.2.0. But when I view the dashboard, it shows no problem with the sdk installations for android or iOS (it says they both are installed correctly). Please help. I'd like to view and be sure all is working as it should. Thanks so much.

   Hello!
   
   3.2.0 requires Xcode 5.0.x and the command line tools. 
   
   If you are using an older version, might not work. The same if you are using a newer version.
   
   Best,
   Mauro
