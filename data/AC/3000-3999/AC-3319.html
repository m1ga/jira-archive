<h3>Description</h3>

Why it's not possible to configure JavaScript minification for emulator and device targeted builds? I don't like the idea to share source code with testers.
I'd like to have the same 'Enable JavaScript Minification' option as for the  Android App Store Distribution.
Is it possible? Or any reason not to have it?

   It is not a common use case to minify non distribution builds as these builds are used for testing and debugging and minification makes it very hard to troubleshoot such issues. Nonetheless, this is an enhancement that we plan to make but it is not on the priority list.</li>
