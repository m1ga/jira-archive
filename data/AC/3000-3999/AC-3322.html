<h3>Description</h3>

Hello,

Titanium Studio's Dashboard says I can get a free Indie seat on the Appcelerator Platform. According to the instruction I need to sign up using the email I use to log into Titanium Studio. The problem is I can't use the email (8riana.8anks@gmail.com)  anymore as I've lost the password and all attempts to recover it are constantly failed.
So I've created a new email box (briana.b4nks@gmail.com) and wanted to change my email in the appc profile. However, seems there is no such option on the [<a href="https://my.appcelerator.com/profile" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://my.appcelerator.com/profile</a>] page.
Could you help me with that, please? What should I do in order to get a free Indie seat on the Appcelerator Platform?

Thanks a lot in advance!

   Hello, I signed up your account in [here](<a href="http://www.appcelerator.com/)." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.appcelerator.com/).</a> You will get a activation link in your mail, which will take you to new Appcelerator dashboard. When you log in to Appcelerator dashboard web portal, from there you need to select Manage Billing from the drop down menu of your account. From there you can choose indie package. Follow these steps. Hope this helps. Reply after trying.
   
   Thanks.

   Hello?</li>
<li>Amimul Hossain 2015-06-27

   Hello, It seems you are not allowed to activate the indie plan for free with your new account. This [link](<a href="http://www.appcelerator.com/appcelerator-platform-is-coming-to-you/)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.appcelerator.com/appcelerator-platform-is-coming-to-you/)</a> describe that Anyone who downloaded Titanium on or before March 31, 2015 qualifies for the offer of a free Indie seat on the Platform. 
   
   As your new account was created after this time. You are not allowed to use indie plan for free. 
   
   You should as [~rtlechuga] advised, send this request from both email addresses to "support@appcelerator.com". Try recovering your previous account password.
   
   Hope this helps, Thanks.
