<h3>Description</h3>

I created a very basic app which requires login using facebook. I also included the 'ti.cloud' module when creating the app.

When the app starts it goes to web browser to get facebook permission in web browser and when it returns to app then it throws this error : "Couldn`t find module 'ti.cloud' " in the simulator but not in console.

"ti.cloud" shows in tiapp.xml , still it throws an error.

   Aditya - We need your environment information ( Titanium SDK + Studio version + CLI version) and your OSX information. Also, we need your sample test case as we were not able to reproduce this issue. To use the ti.cloud module, you need to enable the cloud services.
   
   Please provide the requested information and we would be happy to look into this.</li>

   Titanium SDK : 3.2.1
   Studio Version : build: 3.2.1.201402041146
   OS X version : 10.9.2
   
   and I did enable the cloud services.
   
   I don`t get the error in first run of the application i.e.
   
   1. Application opens 
   2. I click on the button "login it to facebook"
   3. it take me to web browser to get permissions.
   4. after getting permission it returns back to application , then is when i get the error in the simulator but not on the console.
