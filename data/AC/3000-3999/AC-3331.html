   Hi Francisco Alejandro Cruz  ,
   
   Send your request to info@appcelerator.com with all of the pertinent information.
   
   The way it works as, if you want to change your mail account info, you send a mail using that account and provide the alternate account info to "info@appcelerator.com". It usually took 24 hours or so. 
   
   Hope this helps. Feel free to reply.
   
   Thanks </li>
