   Hello, 
   
   What Android device are you trying to connect in your PC. Have you enabled usb debugging in the developer settings on your of your device?. Your ti info shows no android device connected. Choose Media device(MTP) in your device USB computer connection setting. 
   
   Thanks.</li>

   The device is an LG G3 phone, it is working with standard adb, I can connect to it, copy files, open a shell.. everything works
   
   daniele@PCDANY D:\Daniele\Desktop
   > adb devices
   List of devices attached
   LGD855aa068094  device
   
   But, it is not shown in appcelerator studio; I tried to reinstall everything from scratch and also to use a different computer.
   Can it be related to the fact that I'm using windows10 ?

   Hello,
   
   Please run the following commands in the Terminal
   
   1. appc setup check
   2. appc info
   
   Now, check the Android section of the log. Check if have missing any API versions. Go to your Android SDK folder/tools/android, It will open the Android SDK manager and check for available SDKs need to be installed. Install them. Let us know how it goes.
   
   Thanks.

   Do you mean that I have to install all the android api versions?</li>

   Hello, Install the latest ones and the device API version. Also is developer option to your device is enabled or not? If the developer option is not enabled, device can still work for file transfer function but not for app build. Go to your device settings and go to the developer option tab and see if it is enabled or not. Thanks.</li>

   the phone is configured correctly, i can use adb from command line to install apks without any problem.
   The latest sdk is installed, the problem is that titanium ide shows the device in the dropdown menu  bust just after the build starts the decive disappears.
   When the build is finished the device is not there anymore and the adb install fails.
