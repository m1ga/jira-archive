   Hello, 
   
   First try following the guide in here <a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#</a>!/guide/Installation_and_Configuration.
   Now after the studio launch. Open the terminal in the studio and check your node version, Run "node --version".
   Then, Run "sudo npm install appcelerator -g" to install core CLI and After that Run, "appc setup" which will guide you to the installation process. If you face any problem please contact us. 
   
   Thanks.
