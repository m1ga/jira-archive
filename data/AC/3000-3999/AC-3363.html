<h3>Description</h3>

I created an app and its running fine on emulator but as I try to run it on Windows Phone Device it crashes after sometime and at random screens and I am unable to log as it only gives "Disconnected from app" in log window.
My app has Table Views that are getting data from API's and there are no database used.
Is there any way to get the logs to monitor the Crashes?

   This bug reproduce on real device but work fine on emulator. Maybe cause to the windows memory limitation : <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/fr-fr/library/windows/apps/jj681682(v=vs.105).aspx" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://msdn.microsoft.com/fr-fr/library/windows/apps/jj681682(v=vs.105).aspx</a>
   
   When I execute my code the first time it works fine. But when I open app for a second time, I have a message : "Disconnected from app" without more information... 
   I have already clear heap size in Appcelerator Studio but nothing changed. 
   When app crashed, I can't re-run my app. 
   Is there way to find more log on the crash ? 
   It can be a memory leak ? 
   This bug reproduced alternatively, sometimes it work during 2 or 3 execution and sometimes I can't run one time.
   This same apps works fine on Android and iOS with Titanium Studio with sdk 3.3.0.GA but this project was build with SDK 5.4.0.v20160321025856</li>

   Hello, 
   
   The issue is not regeneratable in our end. I would suggest building the app in device without liveview enabled. Also, make sure you have enough memory space in your device. It's better to use the official GA release of the SDK for building the app in device. Current SDK is 5.2.1.GA.

   How to building the app in device without liveview enabled ?
   
   Thanks</li>
<li>Sharif AbuDarda 2016-04-06

   Make sure you are not running the project in device with liveview enabled. See the atatchment. If you see exactly like the picture (Clicked). Unclick it. And run the project.</li>
<li>jmarty 2016-04-07

   Yes my liveview is disabled. Is there way to see log more detailed ?</li>

   Hello, 
   
   Go to studio/help/studio/Run diagnostic test. This will open in a dialog with the log. Copy the contain to a text file and attach the text file in this ticket.
