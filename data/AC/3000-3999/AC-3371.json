					"body": "Hello,\r\n\r\n*Setting your memory configuration*\r\n\r\nBy default, Studio allocates a certain amount of memory to start (the -Xms parameter) and uses a maximum amount (the -Xmx parameter) of Java heap memory, which is usually enough for most development tasks. However, depending on the JRE that you are running and if you are working with additional plugins and have many files open, you may need to increase your amount of memory. You may also find it helpful to increase the size of the permanent generation memory (the --launcher.XXMaxPermSize parameter).\r\n\r\nIn some situations, such as when you have many projects in your workspace or when a project under source control has many files, you may get better performance by increasing the maximum heap memory (the -Xmx parameter). However, setting the memory allocation larger than the available physical memory on your machine can cause issues with Java which will severely degrade your computer's performance and should be avoided.\r\n\r\nMemory usage configuration changes are made in the .ini file. Studio must be restarted for any changes to this file to take effect.\r\n\r\nCertain parameters in the AptanaStudio3.ini or TitaniumStudio.ini file are platform-dependent; For example, only OS X needs the XstartOnFirstThread parameter.\r\n\r\nPlease follow the link http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#!/guide/Setting_Memory_Levels for complete guidance. \r\n",
