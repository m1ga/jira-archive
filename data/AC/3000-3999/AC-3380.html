<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Steps to Reproduce</h4>
- Create foreground service in module (with location listener for example) and with some periodical log to console
- build and deploy module to app
- Start service from application
- Leave app and swype off the application drawer, to kill it
- Wait about 2-3 mins

<h4>Actual Result</h4>
Foreground service is interrupted, icon is back, but nothing else (if you have that location listener it won't be called anymore). If you have some logging done from service you can see, that last log is from TiAnalytics - service stopped. When you click foreground service's icon it will attempt to run app, but Android will prompt you, that it is not responding and if you want to shut it down. There is no log from foreground service that it's onDestroy() was called. App propably crashes silently.

<h4>Expected Result</h4>
The foreground service should run uninterrupted. Even with analytics enabled.
