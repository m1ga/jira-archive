<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Steps to reproduce</h4>
1. Install Java x64 (via Netbeans for PHP),
2. Install Appcelerator - it will say there is Java missing (which is completely normal because Appcelerator works with x32 Java). Appcelerator will require installation of Java (1.png). It won't allow skipping installation (what is completely normal) and will download and install Java.
3. After installation Appcelerator won't be able to work. With every run it will show error (2.png)

<h4>Actual Results</h4>
During every run it will show error.
If you delete Java x64, Java x32, Appcelerator, Netbeans and install Appcelerator first (and download Java via installer) it will work without problem.

<h4>Expected results:</h4>
Appcelerator should recognize proper path or ask to set it if finds such problem.

   Hello, 
   
   Thanks for your concern. The issue should not occur if one's follow the documentation properly. Java and node.js are prerequisites for Appcelerator development. And in JAVA installation section it clearly stated that Java x64 is not supported in windows platform. Now, <a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#</a>!/guide/Installation_and_Configuration in the guide link at it advised to install the prerequisites first and then go on to download the studio and install it. 
   
   So, For now my recommendation is one should follow the guide first before working with Appcelerator. That's the reason the guide is there. The issue will be addressed in later versions for a fix. 
   
   Hope this clears your thoughts. Thanks.

   Hello,
   I think you did not read my ticket's description. Please take time to read it again or I will have to submit it again.
   
   I am aware about manual (i am working with Titanium for 3 years) and in manual you have :
   
       The 32-bit version of the JDK is required regardless of whether Titanium is running on a 32-bit or 64-bit Windows system.
       Studio offers to install JDK 7 if no JDK is found.
   
   So if you have installed first x64 *and than JDK 7 via Appcelerator installer* according to manual it should work.
   
   The bug is that if you:
   1. Install x64 JAVA,
   2. Install x32 JAVA via AS,
   you will get an error as in 2.png
   
   Please reopen the ticket.</li>
