<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Hi,</h4>

I am trying to build the app to my iphone, but the building process is stuck at 57%...
I found a document here:
<a href="https://archive.appcelerator.com/topic/302/unable-to-build-or-run-ios-simulator-stuck-in-launching-delegate-57" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://archive.appcelerator.com/topic/302/unable-to-build-or-run-ios-simulator-stuck-in-launching-delegate-57</a>

But there is no solution.

I did the following too:
- updated studio
- updated xcode
- updated iphone

Any idea how to fix this?

Regards
Bruno

   Hello,
   
   Please run the following command in the terminal.
   
   sudo rm -rf ~/.appcelerator
   sudo rm -rf ~/.titanium
   sudo npm uninstall -g titanium
   sudo npm uninstall -g appcelerator
   sudo npm install -g appcelerator
   appc use latest
   appc setup
   
   Start studio and try creating a new project try building it in your iOS device. Make sure your provisioning profile and certificates is configured for device build. Reply with your findings, Thanks.

   Hi Sharif,
   
   I followed all your terminal instructions.
   That went fine and now I have 5.2.1 installed, but when building the app it gets stuck at *57%* as before.
   
   Any idea how to fix this?
   
   Thanks!</li>

   Hallo, Based on the community thread on the issue you posted, I found changing the password of your Appcelerator account seems to pass the stuck issue. Could you change your Appcelerator account password and try logging into the studio and try building again. 
   
   If that doesn't help, Try running a project in CLI. Run "appc new" and this will guide you to project creation. Now to run the project in iOS run "appc run -p ios". See what happens, This should work. 
   
   In any case please provide the following log as text file in this ticket. 
   
   Run "appc info trace"
   Go to studio/help/studio/run diagnostic log. Attach the log in the ticket. 
   
   Reply with your findings, Thanks.</li>

   Hello, From the log you attached it looks like you have an invalid/expired development certificate installed in your system. This could happen because Apple has changed their worldwide developer relations certificate (WWDR) and developers need to install the new WWDR certificate for app development. Now, You will be needing to create a new development certificate for iOS device development. Please do the following first. 
   
   1. Delete the worldwide developer relations certificate (WWDR) installed in your keychain (If any). 
   2. Delete the development certificate installed in your keychain (If any). 
   
   Now, please follow the link <a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#</a>!/guide/Deploying_to_iOS_devices for building app in iOS device. You will be needing to complete the following steps
   
       1.Register with Apple's Developer program
   
       2.Obtain a developer's certificate
   
       3.Register your test devices
   
       4.Create an App ID
   
       5.Create and install a development provisioning profile
   
       6.Build your app, embedding the profile within the app's bundle. This step takes care of installing to a locally-connected device as well. We will cover distributing your app to remote testers below as well.
   
   The details regarding each step are in the link above. Please carefully follow each step. Feel free to reply if you face any problem following any step. 
   
   Regards,
   Sharif
