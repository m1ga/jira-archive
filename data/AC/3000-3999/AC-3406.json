Could you change your Appcelerator account password and try logging into the studio and try building again. \r\n\r\nIf that doesn't help, Try running a project in CLI. Run \"appc new\" and this will guide you to project creation. Now to run the project in iOS run \"appc run -p ios\". See what happens, This should work. \r\n\r\nIn any case please provide the following log as text file in this ticket. \r\n\r\nRun \"appc info trace\"\r\nGo to studio/help/studio/run diagnostic log. Attach the log in the ticket. \r\n\r\nReply with your findings, Thanks.",

					"body": "Hello, From the log you attached it looks like you have an invalid/expired development certificate installed in your system. This could happen because Apple has changed their worldwide developer relations certificate (WWDR) and developers need to install the new WWDR certificate for app development. Now, You will be needing to create a new development certificate for iOS device development. Please do the following first. \r\n\r\n1. Delete the worldwide developer relations certificate (WWDR) installed in your keychain (If any). \r\n2. Delete the development certificate installed in your keychain (If any). \r\n\r\nNow, please follow the link http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#!/guide/Deploying_to_iOS_devices for building app in iOS device. You will be needing to complete the following steps\r\n\r\n    1.Register with Apple's Developer program\r\n\r\n    2.Obtain a developer's certificate\r\n\r\n    3.Register your test devices\r\n\r\n    4.Create an App ID\r\n\r\n    5.Create and install a development provisioning profile\r\n\r\n    6.Build your app, embedding the profile within the app's bundle. This step takes care of installing to a locally-connected device as well. We will cover distributing your app to remote testers below as well.\r\n\r\nThe details regarding each step are in the link above. Please carefully follow each step. Feel free to reply if you face any problem following any step. \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nSharif\r\n",
