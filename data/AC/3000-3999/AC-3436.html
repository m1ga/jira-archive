<h3>Description</h3>

When I execute my code the first time it works fine. But when I open app for a second time, I have a message : "Disconnected from app" without more information... 
I have already clear heap size in Appcelerator Studio but nothing changed. 
When app crashed, I can't re-run my app. 
Is there way to find more log on the crash ? 
It can be a memory leak ? 
This bug reproduced alternatively, sometimes it work during 2 or 3 execution and sometimes I can't run one time.
This same apps works fine on Android and iOS with Titanium Studio with sdk 3.3.0.GA
