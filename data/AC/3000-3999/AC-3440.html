   Hello, Try logging out from studio. Close the studio and relaunch again and log in. See if the error happens. Thanks.</li>

   This is still happening for me. I log out and log back in (from studio and CLI) and every time it tells me i am not apart of the organization.</li>

   Then,
   appc login

   We're seeing this problem with the latest Studio releases (4.7 and 4.7.1) with Pro subscriptions that have multiple seats.
   
   It appears that Studio can get confused/corrupted/whatever and become unable to verify that you belong to an organization.
   
   This has happened to myself (being unable to create Hyperloop projects) and my business partner (getting the "you are not part of the organization" message in tiapp).
   Is there something happening with the subscription validation service? 
   
   I ask this because as a Paid user of Titanium, I am extremely upset about having these Paid services & features are unavailable to me and my business partner.</li>
