<h3>Description</h3>

Hi,

We have developed an android application in Titanium (SDK version 3.2.1 GA) and published it on Google Play Store on 22nd July 2015. At that time the Application was compitable with Nexus 6. 
Google play was showing warning for our App for "Android: Google Play security alert for insecure TrustManager" to fix this issue Appcelerator has provided a new SDK version 5.2.0. We have upgraded our SDK to 5.2.0 and build the App in Appcelerator and then published the App on Google Play Store. After this release our App is no more compatible with Nexus 6

We have created this App for Mobile devices only

Please let us know what settings we have to add to make our App compatible to Nexus 6 device.

Please find attached the Manifest file with android settings for your reference.

Regards,

   Hello, Does it happens only on Nexus 6? Is there any other device where the problem occurs? Please provide the below information. I Guess you have the studio project.
   
   1. What's the android version running in your Nexus 6?
   2. Please try to build the app from studio in Nexus 6 and see if any problem arises. Please provide the error log.
   3. Please provide the info in your tiapp.xml file of the project. 
   
   Also, SDK 5.2.1.GA is available now. You can try rebuilding in that SDK and see if any problem occurs in Nexus 6
   
   Reply with the above information.

   Hi,
   
   This was also happening with Nexus 5, to fix for Nexus 5 we have added the compatible screen settings as below.
   <screen android:screenSize="normal" android:screenDensity="480" />
   <screen android:screenSize="large" android:screenDensity="480" />
   We found that the screen density  for Nexus 6 is higher than we added two more tags for Nexus 6 as below
   <screen android:screenSize="normal" android:screenDensity="640" />
   <screen android:screenSize="large" android:screenDensity="640" />
   But this doesn't work for Nexus 6. Android version running in your Nexus 6 is Marshmallow 6.0 and 6.0.1
   
   Please find attached the tiapp.xml file.</li>

   Hello, 
   
   You should try removing the whole <compatible-screens> tag and put this piece of code just before the <application> tag in your manifest file.
   
   <supports-screens android:largeScreens="true"
   android:normalScreens="true" android:smallScreens="true"
   android:anyDensity="true" android:xlargeScreens="true" />

   Hi,
   
   We have tried using these tags and removing the whole <compatible-screens> tag, same was the result.
   Actually we have created this app for only mobile devices, it should not be compatible with Tablets. So for this we have added <compatible-screens> Tag.</li>

   Hello, 
   
   1.First of all, you need to set the screenDensity to 560 in the AndroidManifest for compatible-screens. 
   
   2.Then, Make sure to provide xxhdpi (and maybe xxxhdpi) icons for the application. <a href="http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2014/10/getting-your-apps-ready-for-nexus-6-and.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2014/10/getting-your-apps-ready-for-nexus-6-and.html</a>, it is said that you should provide at least a xxxhdpi icon.
