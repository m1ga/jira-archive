<h3>Description</h3>

Is there a way to improve ListView creation with, for example, a template cache?
I manage to make an "alloy side" template cache that improve by 10% the ListView creation. But on IOS the ListView take long time for layout.
My use case is a ListView with 14 templates and more than 250 view to generate.
Thank you

   Hello, 
   
   You are wanting something for listview to create a large number of templates and views in shorter time then it usually take for Appcelerator to do so. Is there some way this is possible in native platform or some method or processes by which native code handles this. I am asking for some example of that. Also, Please explain your features a little bit.
