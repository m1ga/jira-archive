   Hello, 
   
   I have tested an application with Liveview enabled in iOS and Android emulator. Liveview is working fine with Appcelerator Studio, build: 4.5.0.201602170821. Make sure your internet connection is ok.

   I can reproduce this. I have the LiveView button enabled but the logs show nothing related to LiveView.
   
   The <code>appc ti config</code> does include the LiveView hook and the path is correct.</li>

   Hello,
   
   I have tested this again. Liveview is working as expected in simulator, emulator. See the screenshots.

   Make sure your pc and your device is connected to the same network. If you are using wifi connection make sure your device and pc is in the neme network. If you are using dial up connection, make sure your pc's wifi share option is enabled (for simulator). Also, make sure you are not using internet behind a proxy. If you are using proxy than please follow the guide here on how to enable procy sattings in studio. <a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#</a>!/guide/Using_Studio_From_Behind_a_Proxy

   Hello, Please check if you can browse through safari in simulator. Following two port: 8323 and 8324 should not be blocked. make sure no other program is using this port. Check by 
   
   sudo lsof -i :8323
   sudo lsof -i :8324
   
   Make sure no other program is using these port. Do a clean on the project. Now try building with LiveView enabled.

   Sharif.</li>

   Hello, 
   
   It looks to be your pc's port 8323 is used by node. You need to open that port for Appcelerator use as liveView to use. Please look through the net on how to open a specific port in mac. You will find solution in here <a href="http://www.macworld.co.uk/how-to/mac-software/how-open-specific-ports-in-os-x-1010-firewall-3616405/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.macworld.co.uk/how-to/mac-software/how-open-specific-ports-in-os-x-1010-firewall-3616405/</a> 
   
   "sudo lsof -i :8323", is not suppose to response anything if the port is open.

   Sharif.</li>

   Hello, The "ENOENT" error occur if there is no node installed or running. You need the node to run in the back for Appcelerator. 
   
   As I see when you stop the node process you can use the port 8323 as it shows in the console
   
   <code><pre>
   [LiveView] File Server Started on Port 8324
   [LiveView] Alloy project monitor started
   [LiveView] Event Server Started on Port 8323
   </pre></code>
   
   You need the port 8323 open for liveview and you need the node running on some other port. If you enable the node now then it will take some other port as port 8323 already in use. 
   
   Enable node and try running again. 
   
   Thanks.</li>

    Hello,
    thanks for the response.
    I tried to use live view on a new clean alloy project and it work fine.
    Now I'm confused, is there something that causes this error on a specific project?
    Liveview dosen't work on all my existing projects.
    Thanks in advance

    Cleaning the projects and running again might resolve the issue. It seems liveView is working on the new projects. The issue could be closed.
