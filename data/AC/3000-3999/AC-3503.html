   Hello, 
   
   Did you create a new distribution certificate for the app publication. As you have changed the WRD certificate. You need to create a new distribution certificate as WRD certificate enforces the Certificate Signing Request (CSR) for generating distribution certificate. So, if you had an old distribution certificate with the old WRD certificate, that will not work with publishing app. you need to create new distribution certificate with the new WRD certificate installed in your system. 
   
   Regards,
   Sharif.</li>
