   Hello, 
   
   Could you please explain a little more? That module you are trying to compile. Is it in Android or iOS? Can you provide some sample code for us to test the issue. Also, please run "appc info" in terminal and provide the log as a text file in the ticket. 
   
   Regards,
   Sharif</li>

   Hi Sharif,
   
   Android Module. 
   Tried everything. It's seems that there was an incompatibility with an old ant version. I reinstalled and was not working. So i decided to delete from the mac application dir and reinstalled Appcelerator again and now it works!
