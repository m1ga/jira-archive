<h3>Description</h3>

I installed Node v4.4.3 and then appcelerator and ran DEBUG=* appc setup -l trace

It then tries to download the CLI core but the request sent is 
appc:util request {"url":{"protocol":"https:","slashes":true,"auth":null,"host":"software.appcelerator.com","port":443,"hostname":"software.appcelerator.com","hash":null,"search":null,"query":null,"pathname":"/api/appc/install/","path":"/api/appc/install/","href":"<a href="https://software.appcelerator.com/api/appc/install/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://software.appcelerator.com/api/appc/install/</a>"},"headers":{"user-agent":"Appcelerator CLI/4.2.4 (darwin)","host":"software.appcelerator.com","appc-token":null},"proxy":"<OLD PROXY INFO>"}

There is old proxy info set (from a previous installation) which must be removed. Running <code>appc config set proxyServer null</code> also attempts to download the CLI core first with the incorrect proxy information so it does not work. There needs to be a way to remove that proxy info without trying to download the CLI core first, or manually delete it from a config file somewhere. I do not have the studio installed and started with a clean install of NodeJS and Appcelerator.

   Hello, Try to run the below commands one by one.
   
   sudo rm -rf ~/.appcelerator
   sudo rm -rf ~/.titanium
   sudo npm uninstall -g appcelerator
   sudo npm uninstall -g titanium
   sudo npm install -g appcelerator
   appc config set proxyServer null
   appc use latest
   appc setup

   I cannot run
   appc config set proxyServer null
   
   I eventually get:
   Download server is not currently available. Please re-try your install again in a few moments. If you continue to have this problem, please contact Appcelerator Support at support@appcelerator.com.
   
   When I run DEBUG=* appc config set proxyServer null -l trace I see that old proxy information is still stored
   
   appc:util request {"url":{"protocol":"https:","slashes":true,"auth":null,"host":"software.appcelerator.com","port":443,"hostname":"software.appcelerator.com","hash":null,"search":null,"query":null,"pathname":"/api/appc/install/","path":"/api/appc/install/","href":"<a href="https://software.appcelerator.com/api/appc/install/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://software.appcelerator.com/api/appc/install/</a>"},"headers":{"user-agent":"Appcelerator CLI/4.2.4 (darwin)","host":"software.appcelerator.com","appc-token":null},"proxy":"http://username:password@proxy:port"}
   
   This is what I'm trying to remove:
   "proxy":"http://username:password@proxy:port"</li>

   Hello,
   According to documentation max supported version of Node.js in accelerator at this moment is 4.2.x.
   [Documentation Link](<a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#</a>!/guide/Titanium_Compatibility_Matrix-section-29004837_TitaniumCompatibilityMatrix-Node.js)
   
   You said you installed Node v4.4.3 . This can be the issue. Uninstall this version and install version in the range and see if things work. Please let us know the result.
   
   Thanks</li>

   Hi,
   
   The documentation for installing the CLI provides a download for Node v4.4.3 and support@appcelerator.com told me to use v4.4.3 as well.
   
   <a href="https://web.appcelerator.com/product/cli" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://web.appcelerator.com/product/cli</a>
   
   I believe this is an issue with a proxy setting not getting cleared from a previous installation. I have also checked ~/.appcelerator/appc-cli.json and there is no setting for a proxy.
   
   I also just tried Node v4.2.6 and got the same results.

   I was able to reset my password to the old password that Appcelerator was trying to use that I saw using the DEBUG command:
   
   "proxy":"http://username:password@proxy:port"
   
   I then restarted my computer and ran:
   
   DEBUG=* appc config set proxyServer null -l trace
   
   and I saw that it was attempting to connect using *an even older password.* I then reset that password to the even older password, restarted my computer, and was able to connect and install the CLI core without any issues.
   
   My question is: Where is the CLI getting this password/proxy information (my OS X keychain or something else)? This is only a temporary, one time fix - my password expires every 60 days and I cannot go through this process every time I change it.</li>

   Hello, Please check for any configuration keys in your keychain. Remove them. You can also remove certain keys as
   
   titanium config [--remove] [--output <value>] [<key>] [<value>]
   
   See the reference <a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#</a>!/guide/Titanium_Command-Line_Interface_Reference-section-35619828_TitaniumCommand-LineInterfaceReference-ConfigOptions
   
   Closing the ticket.
