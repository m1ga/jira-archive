   Hello, The issue is with .project file. Somehow it's corrupted. You might need  to reinstall the whole system. Thy running the following commands in administrative command prompt.
   
   rm -rf ~/.appcelerator
   rm -rf ~/.titanium
   npm uninstall -g titanium
   npm uninstall -g appcelerator
   
   Uninstall the previous studio Remove any folder related to titanium or appcelerator and reinstall the studio. Now, If you have JDK (32bit) and node installed in your system the studio install will complete successfully. Now run the below commands in studio terminal.
   
   npm install -g appcelerator
   appc use latest
   appc setup
   
   Try to create project after this. Let us know if you encounter any more problem.
   
   Regards,
   Sharif.</li>

   Hello Sharif,
   
   By the way this error occurred on Windows 10 so I deleted one part via npm and appc and the other .files via Windows Explorer.
   I have checked and cleaned too the registry.
   
   For you info, I installed recently a clean Windows 10 Pro on this machine and other dev tools before Studio.
   The re-install via above method was no problem. But after I installed Appcelerator Studio and tried to create a new or import an existing sample the same problem occurred. I checked my laptop for Node version etc. because this machine had also a clean Windows 10 Pro install and had no problems with Appcelerator Studio and other dev tools using npm.
   
   NOTICE: The problem machine had NodeJS 0.12 installed... very old.
   
   In the weekend I am going to do a clean install and will let you know if the problem is gone.
   Maybe the old NodeJS version has messed things up during install.
   
   Regards and a nice weekend,
   Erik</li>

   Hello, I would suggest you do a clean install according to the link <a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#</a>!/guide/Installation_and_Configuration
   
   Couple of things to remember for windows.
   
   1. Make sure your JDK is 32bit despite if your operating system being 64bit. 
   2. Make sure you set the environment variable right.
   
   If you don't have JDK and node installed during studio installation it will prompt you to do so. I prefer this. let us know who it goes. Also, if the problem persists, make sure you provide the diagnostic log to this ticket.
   
   Regards,
   Sharif.</li>

   Hello Sharif,
   
   The problem is solved after I did a Windows 10 - Reset PC because all the uninstall options didn't work.
   Unfortunately I can not explain now what exactly caused the problem but I can create a new project file via the menu and Dashboard (Default Alloy) and import an existing project (Employee Directory) from Dashboard.
   
   However, the Samples tab is not showing up and if you look in the attached log file (Appcelerator Studio.log) you will see there were some issues during install. For your info I just installed as Administrator the downloaded file AppcelerarorStudio.exe.
   Only NodeJS/NPM, Java JDK, Android SDK/NDK and necessary environment/path settings were installed before (See Diagnostic.log)
   
   I also see now and then in the Console box this output after starting Appcelerator Studio in Windows 10 Pro:
   ["Expected ')'","",1]
   ["Expected ')'","",1]
   It disappears by itself after one or two seconds.
   
   See log files for further information (Appcelerator Studio.log, Appc Info.log and Diagnostig.log).
   
   Thanks and regards,
   Erik
