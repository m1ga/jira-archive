<h3>Description</h3>

Sorry for that ticket, but I'm really waiting for this release. I created a lot of tickets of windows bugs. And today I tried 5.3.0.beta and it's working absolutelly terrible. With 5.2.1 sdk my app is working somehow, but for now 5.3.0.beta brought a lot of new bugs. And I don't know what to do now. Should I create a 10-20 new tickets? Or should I wait for GA release?

   Hello, 
   
   Please wait for the GA release. You don't need to create separate tickets for every issue in the beta release. You can let us know the issue that you found and write them in this ticket separately. Please provide sample test case for each issue. Beta release always have some issues, that is why it's not official release. Let us know the issues that you found. We will test the issue in our environment. If we are able to reproduce the issues we will fixed them and possibly make them available in the GA release.
   
   Regards,
   Sharif.
