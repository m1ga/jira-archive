<h3>Description</h3>

Unable to distribute a Ti binary to the iOS app store if it contains an embedded watch app using Swift. Project will build OK and run on both SIM and Device as well as compiling  for distribution to the app-store. The binary uploads (using organiser in Xcode) and passes validation. But always reports as an invalid binary via an email from iTunes connect. 

Copy of email below.

_Dear developer,

We have discovered one or more issues with your recent delivery for â€œxxxxxxxxxxxxx". To process your delivery, the following issues must be corrected:

Invalid Swift Support - The SwiftSupport folder is missing. Rebuild your app using the current public (GM) version of Xcode and resubmit it.

Once these issues have been corrected, you can then redeliver the corrected binary.

Regards,

The App Store team_

The project was generated using the Ti CLI and the watch extension added using the Ti CLI and selecting watch-os2 swift.

Everything appears fine other than the final rejection from the app store.
