<h3>Description</h3>

I have updated my project from 5.0.2 to 5.2.2.GA and it has broken the way my pickers work. I'm initially setting the pickers to a height of 0 in TSS (to hide them), then when i want to show them, i set to Ti.UI.SIZE. This worked before changing the SDK to the new version. Now the picker does not change height, it is stuck at 0. I've seen that it works if it is set initially to Ti.UI.SIZE then when the window opens, set to 0. But this results in a flashing of the picker when the window opens.

   Hey there! We fixed that (incorrect) behavior in the recent 5.1.0 release. Setting a height to 0 to hide a UI element is not advised and should be replaced by using the <code>visible</code> property instead. Thanks!</li>
