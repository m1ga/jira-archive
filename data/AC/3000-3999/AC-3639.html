<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Steps to Reproduce</h4>
- Go into my project directory
- With the Titanium CLI : ti build -p ios -l 9.2 --log-level debug

<h4>Actual Result</h4>
After the 'Launching iOS Simulator' line, a 'TypeError: Bad argument' exception is thrown.
I could build and run without any problem a few weeks ago. Since I have not made any modification into my code and I cannot run anymore.

<h4>Expected Result</h4>
I was expecting the same behaviour that a few weeks ago, that my app launches

   Hello,
   
   As you are using Appcelerator studio and I presume you have Appcelerator installed correctly, I would suggest you run the app with "appc run -p ios -l 9.2". 
   
   Now, If that didn't work I would suggest you run 
   "appc use latest"
   "appc setup"
   
   If this commands runs successfully, then there is no problem with your environment.  
   
   Regards,
   Sharif.
