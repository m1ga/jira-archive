   As per the attachment if you see the button pattern i am able to achieve the button color with background image but i can't place a arrow icon on top of it with something like position absolute it. Also without using javascript i can't see any option to make the button text to uppercase.</li>

   Hello, 
   
   1. Why don't you use an image as button background image, that has already an arrow icon at the corner. 
   2. For Android 5 and up, By default button title is uppercase. Currently, Appcelerator has no property for making button title uppercase in iOS. You can use uppercase letters in button title for that. 
   
   Now, If you want the feature for iOS, Please provide reference on how this is done in native platform. 
   
   Regards,
   Sharif.
