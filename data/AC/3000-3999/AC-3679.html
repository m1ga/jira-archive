<h3>Description</h3>

I tried to build the appx of my windows app by means the command :
appc run -p windows -T dist-phonestore -O <output directory>
but doesn't work. 
It returns : "You cannot perform this operation with your current plan.  Please upgrade to build your application for production distribution."

I'm using the free license.

Can be necessary use some paid licences to solve the problem? and if the response is yes, which?


I also tried to use the command Ti build -p windows -T dist-phonestore -O <output_directory> to build the appx. This time i'm able to create it, but it is not accepted by the windows phone store, because the value of the ti.windows.publishername inside the tiapp.xml is not wrote in the manifest inside the appx.
Obviously in both the cases i modified the tiapp.xml file with all the features needed for the windows store: publisher id, app name, etc..


Thanks

   Hello, 
   
   As a free user youâ€™ll have full access to the Platform but you can not publish your app to windows phone store. You need to have a paid plan only when you decide to take your first app live. Here is the link to our packages. You can upgrade your package by <a href="https://billing.appcelerator.com/billing" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://billing.appcelerator.com/billing</a> in dashboard.
