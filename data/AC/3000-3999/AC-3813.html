<h3>Description</h3>

I think I've just had my app rejected from the App Store because of this.

For the longest time (since Ti SDK3) I've used the recursive directory version of this to set all files in a folder to being remoteBackup = false. My app has just been rejected using the latest SDK saying that 38mb download was not flagged as being excluded. I've triple checked and this is being set at the directory level.

I think this needs to be re-opened and checked for the recursive version still working.

This is related to TIMOB-23141 - it's this recently merged fix that has broken it.

   Anyway, the issue should not occur in 5.2.1.GA, since the change is only in the master-build for 5.4.0, yet. Please verify that.</li>
