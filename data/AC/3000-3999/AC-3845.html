<h3>Description</h3>

When I tap a link to open the app from notes (external resource) on android, it doesn't open the views I have in index.js based on variables I have in Alloy.js.  if I override those alloy.js variables in index.js it works. 

For example :
My App has a Alloy.Globals.url = Ti.Android.currentActivity.intent.data;  in alloy.js  in index.js, my app doesn't work, however, in index.js if I over ride that url with a new one like Alloy.Globals.url = "<a href="http://myapp.com/newurl" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://myapp.com/newurl</a>"; it works.

Again, this is only when I click a link to open the app via an external resource (notes, email, browser, etc)
