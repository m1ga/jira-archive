<h3>Description</h3>

I have a ListItem object in a ListView that I use data binding to bind some runtime properties to the item. Before updating Appcelerator everything worked great. However, when I installed the latest build for Appcelerator (4.6.0) I found that some of the properties were not being respected.

Specifically the right and left properties are now ignored at runtime thus throwing off my alignment. Below I have a code excerpt showing ListItem template and the data binding so you can see what is going on.

// Data Binding for list item

<ListView id="messagesListView" defaultItemTemplate="textMessage" onItemclick="messageClickHandler" backgroundColor="transparent">
    <Templates>
        <ItemTemplate name="textMessage">
            <View width="Ti.UI.FULL" height="Ti.UI.SIZE">
                <View bindId="container" width="Ti.UI.SIZE">
                    <Label class="messageText font17" bindId="message" width="Ti.UI.SIZE" height="Ti.UI.SIZE" />
                </View>
            </View>
        </ItemTemplate>
    </Templates>
    <ListSection id="messagesList" dataTransform="transformMessage" dataCollection="messages" dataFunction="updateMessagesList">
        <ListItem
            template="{ template }"
            message:text="{ messageBody }"
            message:color="{ messageColor }"
            container:backgroundColor=" { backgroundColor }"
            container:left="{ containerLeft }"
            container:right="{ containerRight }" />
    </ListSection>
    <RefreshControl id="refreshControl" platform="ios" />
</ListView>

Prior to the update the layout above would create a little bubble that would show on either left or right of the screen conditionally. Now the bubbles only show on the left. The reason for the incorrect layout if because the "container:left" and "container:right" properties are being ignored. When I remove these properties from the data binding and manually set them in the template my layout works as expected.

Also, please note I have removed all layout code that is not relevant to the problem. At the end of the day the "container:left" and "container:right" properties are being ignored now. Any ideas what is going on here?

   Hello, 
   
   The code you provided is not sufficient enough. There are some additional components missing. Please provide a full reproducible code and please explain the issue that is happening. Possibly with screenshots? Also, Please provide a full list of steps to follow for successful regeneration.

   Probably. 5.3 still uses Alloy 1.8.7 and the last few fixes are only available in 1.9. I don't know why we actually continued to ship with 1.8.7 and not bumped to 1.9. [~cng]?</li>
<li>Chee Kiat Ng 2016-06-17

   looks like alloy 1.9 is tagged with 5.4.0. I'll make sure that happens.</li>
<li>Hans Knöchel 2016-06-20

   Can we include Alloy 1.9.0 in 5.3.1 / 5.3.2 or make a Alloy 1.8.8 with that particular fix? Thank you.</li>
<li>Fokke Zandbergen 2016-06-20

   [~hansknoechel] AFAIK the only diff between 1.8.7 and 1.9.0 IS the refactored data binding which fixes this.</li>
<li>Mike Neill 2016-06-20

   Is there a way to get 1.9 so I can fix the issue in my app? I've got a client who needs a build ASAP with this sorted.</li>

   [~miken01] Install <code>\[sudo\] npm install -g alloy</code> and follow [this gist](<a href="https://gist.github.com/falkolab/da74a5fab2a7226090e357ab68426bf6)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://gist.github.com/falkolab/da74a5fab2a7226090e357ab68426bf6)</a>, but be aware that this doesn't work together with LiveView (which will still use the bundled Alloy)</li>
<li>Mike Neill 2016-06-20

   Ok, I have updated Alloy to 1.9 via the gist above and it fixed my issues. I really appreciate the help @Fokke Zandbergen!</li>
