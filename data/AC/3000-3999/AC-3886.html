<h3>Description</h3>

I do have 100 single png files inside my application (local assets folder) to show a circular-progress on my items inside a Listview.
One Image for each possible percentage value.

If i try to render them inside my listview only the first 4-6 items are correct, items after that are showing wrong images, but the value inside a label on the same row is correct. (see screenshot for example)

After some testing it occurs, if i scroll quickly from top to bottom and repeat this a few times, after some try-outs the images are correct.
Scrolling again and they are wrong again.

So i guess there are Bugs inside the Listview rendering Items like this.

(on Android everything works fine - Tested on Genymotion Emulator and 2 different Android Devices)

   Hello, We need a test code, for your case a sample app that causing the issue in iOS. We will test it in our environment and if we generate the issue we will understand the issue clearly and can recommend something. If this is a bug we will escalate the ticket. As you said the issue is not occurring for Android. This is probably memory issue for iOS, as it's taking time to render. Attach a sample code to work with. 
   
   Regards,
   Sharif.</li>
