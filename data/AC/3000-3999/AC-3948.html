<h3>Description</h3>

The affected component is Appcelerator Studio and affected version is 4.6.0.201605201934, but such values are not allowed by the form.

Following the tutorial for installing an Android device, I reached the following line:

In Studio, first select the project in the Project Explorer view, then in the global tool bar, select Run from the Launch Mode drop-down list and an Android device from the Target drop-down list under the Android Application Installer category.

For my version of Appcelerator Studio, under the Target drop-down list there is no "Android Application Installer" category. I just have "Android device", and when I choose it, a message box appears, that shows the message "There are no Android devices connected", although my tablet says to be connected as multimedia device.
How can I connect my Android tablet to Appcelerator Studio?

   Hello, Make sure you have developer option enabled in your device (USB debugging). And in USB computer connection you have media device selected. After connecting the device First, check in Android "ddms" tools, that the device is detected or not. If the device shows in there then you followed the previous steps successfully. Now, Open "android" tools, and check for any SDK update you required or not. Update as recommended. Go to the studio and do couples of refresh from drop-down list. If the device still doesn't show. Then In studio terminal run "appc info" and attach the log as text file in this ticket. We will look into it. 
   
   Regards,
   Sharif.</li>
