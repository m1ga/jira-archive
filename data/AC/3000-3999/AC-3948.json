After connecting the device First, check in Android \"ddms\" tools, that the device is detected or not. If the device shows in there then you followed the previous steps successfully. Now, Open \"android\" tools, and check for any SDK update you required or not. Update as recommended. Go to the studio and do couples of refresh from drop-down list. If the device still doesn't show. Then In studio terminal run \"appc info\" and attach the log as text file in this ticket. We will look into it. \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nSharif.",
