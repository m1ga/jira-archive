<h3>Description</h3>

I'm getting an error configuring SMTP settings via platform.appcelerator.com. The page constantly states "The smtp settings are not valid". I tested with another account that is still using cloud.appcelerator.com and the exact same SMTP settings were successfully used. This seems like a bug in platform.appcelerator.com. Please advise.

   Any status on this? I have a client waiting to publish their app until we get SMTP resolved. Thank you!</li>

   Hello, I have tried with your SMTP settings in one of my app. This seems to be working. I don't get any error "The smtp settings are not valid" as such. Can you try on a different browser and if that happens can you record a video and share with us. Thanks.</li>

   It appears to be working for me now. Thank you. You may close this ticket.</li>

   From what I can figure out… after you save the SMTP settings… you have to paste the password Again, and then Save again, then it works.
   
   Something is wrong with the Web Form.</li>

   This is still a problem for me.</li>
