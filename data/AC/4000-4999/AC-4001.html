   Hey there,
   
   please check out our [3D-Touch sample application](<a href="https://github.com/appcelerator-developer-relations/appc-sample-3dtouch)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator-developer-relations/appc-sample-3dtouch)</a> for best-practices. Thanks!</li>

   I am also trying to implement 3d Touch in my app.
   I am able to generate the shortcut icon but I am not able to implement it on list view.
   For creating the application I have referred the 3D-Touch sample application downloaded from(<a href="https://github.com/appcelerator-developer-relations/appc-sample-3dtouch)." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator-developer-relations/appc-sample-3dtouch).</a>
   
   I am trying to create same type of app which is attached by the reporter.
   Can I get the help regarding implementing the same.
   
   Thanks in advance.
   
   Environment:
   Mac OS: El Capitan (10.11.5)
   Implementing on Device: iPhone 6s (9.3.2)
   Titanium SDK: 5.2.2 GA
   Appcelerator Studio, build: 4.5.0.201602170821

   Hey guys,
   
   the feature was implemented by me and it still seems to work properly in both the sample application and other applications that use the API. So if you have questions on how to implement the features, the demo-apps should give 1:1 examples on how to do that properly. If you have code-level questions, please feel free to ask our [TiSlack community](<a href="http://tislack.org)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://tislack.org)</a> or on [StackOverflow](<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/appcelerator)." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/appcelerator).</a> Also check out the related [PreviewContext docs](<a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#</a>!/api/Titanium.UI.iOS.PreviewContext).
   
   Finally, also make sure we are talking about the same thing. Because the shortcut items and peek&pop are two very different API's. Shortcuts are used on the home-screen and peek&pop in-app.
   
   I hope that helps getting started. Maybe we also make a detailed guide in the future, but those docs should help pretty well. Thanks!</li>
