<h3>Description</h3>

I'm trying to create satisfactory windows phone application. I have android and ios versions, and now dealing with winphone. But there is one huge problem is performance. Opening of some screens takes 3-4 seconds. Time takes by creating of structure of screen (buttons, views etc.) Or adding a lot of rows to listview reduces performance =( 

There is some plan to fix it in future? Or for you it's okay? I can provide sample app which opens one screen from my working application, but I suppose that you undesrtand and know about this issue.
