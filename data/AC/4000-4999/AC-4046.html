<h3>Description</h3>

I am trying to trial the software but am unable to launch a simulator.  being that I am trying to follow any of your tutorials, it is difficult to get that far if the first step is giving me issues.  I get the following error in the console:

2016-07-08T16:09:33.790Z | ERROR | An uncaught exception was thrown!
Cannot read property 'options' of undefined
2016-07-08T16:09:33.791Z | ERROR | Cannot read property 'options' of undefined
2016-07-08T16:09:33.791Z | TRACE | TypeError: Cannot read property 'options' of undefined


I have been back and forth with one of your support people for a week or so until I was instructed to open a bug report.  I would definitely like to get into this software a bit as I have a few things that I would like to develop.

   Hi,
   Thanks for reaching us. Please run the following command in the administrative command prompt.
   <code><pre>
   npm uninstall -g titanium
   npm uninstall -g appcelerator
   npm install -g appcelerator
   appc use latest
   appc setup
   </pre></code>
   The JDK needs to be 32bit whether windows running 32 or 64 bit.
   
   
   You need to create an Android emulator or setup Genymotion 
   
   To create an Android emulator, see [Native Android Debugging and Testing Tools: Creating an emulator.| <a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#</a>!/guide/Native_Android_Debugging_and_Testing_Tools-section-29004938_NativeAndroidDebuggingandTestingTools-Creatinganemulator]
   To setup Genymotion, see [Installing Genymotion](<a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#</a>!/guide/Installing_Genymotion)
   
   To retrieve a list of Android or Genymotion emulators, run the ti info -p android command.

   I told you I tried this before and it did nothing.  I am finding another program as your support is awful.</li>
