<h3>Description</h3>

The push notifications are very unstable. They stop working sometimes, then we need to clear device tokens from the appcelerator platform and re-register the devices for them to start working again.

   Hi,
   On 21st July, we cleared the tokens and then subscribed 10 test devices and made sure they showed up in subscribed devices page(screenshot attached). 
   After subscribing, we tested the push notifications using the following JSON: 
   <a href="https://api.cloud.appcelerator.com/v1/push_notification/notify_tokens.json?key=D2xBdBZ3YqTvNVbhdL1HuzFgMhZnKPxC&pretty_json=true&channel=notification_alerts&payload=" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://api.cloud.appcelerator.com/v1/push_notification/notify_tokens.json?key=D2xBdBZ3YqTvNVbhdL1HuzFgMhZnKPxC&pretty_json=true&channel=notification_alerts&payload=</a>{     "alert": "Test",   "sound":"default",   "title": "Example",     "vibrate": true, "icon":"appicon" }&to_tokens=<device-token>
   
   The test notification worked for all but one device.
   
   We have been monitoring the push notifications and they work on 4 of the devices and none of the others.

   HI,
   
   Is there any progress in resolving the issue?
   
   We are receiving alerts for our test accounts. But for TTSH(Tan Tock Seng Hospital) none of the patient accounts are receiving the alerts. 
   We have SLAs to meet and we have to update MOHH on regular basis on the resolution. 
   
   Kindly let us know the actions we need to take ASAP. Please let us know should you need any more details from our side. 
   
   Thank you!</li>

   Hi Sharif, Shak,
   
   We have observed that the devices are being un-subscribed automatically once in few days. And the notifications are being failed with error message 1005-There is no corresponding subscriptions ... (please look at the attached screen shot) .
   
   Is it a known issue? Any work arounds ? Could you please help us on fixing this? </li>
