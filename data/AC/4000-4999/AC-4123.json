		"description": "h3. Steps to Reproduce\nI start to use this software, using my login javier@ahora94.com ... one year ago or more when we start the deal was we can use as trial, and when we want to publish the app, we should pay the services.\n\nI understand and is ok \n\nh3. Actual Result\nthe actual result is i cant not sign with javier@ahora94.com, and i have lose all the projects that i try to do. the actual result i create other user, and this new user expires in 45 days i think, i think after you should purchase i dont know what if i will not publish nothing.\n\nh3. Expected Result\nif you use Xcode, android studio, similar software that appstudio, you use and when you publish you should pay.. is ok pay something when you use the service, but pay without use or publish nothing have no sense. I read in some place that for users than more that one year. will not have any trouble and the software we can use for free till we publish something.. so i dont understand why you change conditions\n\nthanks in advance",
