<h3>Description</h3>

Since the change of *i18n&platform* folders to app folder, every 2 times I build I got this error:

{noformat}
[ERROR] : EPERM, operation not permitted 'W:\appc\project\i18n'
[ERROR] Alloy compiler failed
{noformat}

This happens in both of my PCs: home and office (always after installing 5.2.0 or upper). If I immediately build again, the error dissapear (or if I remove manually the i18n&platform folders). Normally, this happens in clicly: one time no error, next time error, again no error, again error...

The main problem is that, when using Liveview in office, if I save a change liveview is not able to recompile and, therefore, nothing happens in the app (no changes reflected, no restart... nothing). While in my home computer, if I save changes two times, first fails but second recompiles right, in office no matters the times I save changes, nothing happens.

I think is related to CLI, but in house I have SDK 5.2.2 and in office 5.3.1

   Hello, This issue is not reproducible. Are you still having it?</li>
<li>Manuel Conde Vendrell 2016-08-11

   Hi Sharif. Yes it happens always in both PCs (Win 7). I have a clear Win10 system with clear Appc install and there doesn't happen.</li>

   Hello, Do a clean setup on win 7 environment. See if the error occour then. Thanks.</li>

   I already did a clean setup of all Appc stuff, following my own tutorial: <a href="https://medium.com/all-titanium/reinstalling-appcelerator-titanium-on-windows-from-scratch-f7c50e2161f3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://medium.com/all-titanium/reinstalling-appcelerator-titanium-on-windows-from-scratch-f7c50e2161f3</a>, in both systems.
   
   Still the same. Seems that I will need a clean Win7 install, but I will not do that.</li>

   Hello, Whats the update on this, Do you still have the issue?</li>

   Hi Sharif.
   
   As I said, probably I will need a clean Win7 install to solve this problem (because in a Win10 clean install it works well), but I cannot do that right now (a lot of tools in my dev machine).
   
   So, ignore this problem by now.</li>
