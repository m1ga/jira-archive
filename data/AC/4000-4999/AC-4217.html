<h3>Description</h3>

The Callback function for the registerForPushNotifications()-Method does not fire.
We tested out application on IPad (IOS 9.3.3) and an Ipod Touch(IOS 9.3.2)...
The setup was done like it is described in the documentation: <a href="https://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#</a>!/guide/Push_Notifications

Android works just fine... But the IOS devices are only able to subscribe to the desired channel but they are not getting any notifications.

We tested the notification distribution with the dashboard.

   As noted on Slack, we did not touch the remote notification since years. I just tested it on a device and it just works. Most probably, either the .p12 push certificate is not configured correctly or the provisioning profile that is used to sign the application for the device is not bundled with the apns entitlements correctly.</li>
