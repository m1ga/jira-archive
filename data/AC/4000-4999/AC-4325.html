<h3>Description</h3>

I have all working with 5.1.2 before my update to 5.3.1.GA
After that update, I 'm not able to do Liveview work properly.

No error, all compiles and starts right, the app works fine, simply when I do a change in a file I get <code>[LiveView]  Alloy recompile initiated for android...</code> and nothing more happens.

On windows, when you use Liveview, a new DOS window is opened when recompiling, and later it is closed (usually is closed after some seconds, the same seconds of Alloy compiling time).

But now that window is opened and closed in 1 second, so no recompilation is done and then, nothing happens in the app.

I removed all Appcelerator installations, Node and NPMs from my system and installed it again, but I still have the same issue.

I tried to install in a Windows 10 notebook and there all is working fine.
Â¿Maybe is a Windows 7 issue?

   Hello, The issue is not reproducible in our end. Can you Try a clean and rebuilding your app. Thanks.</li>

   I cleaned but still the same.
   
   I also did a new project and same result. Seems like Liveview is "broken" since my update from 5.1 to 5.3.
   
   But I found something interesting: I did a "classic" project and Liveview worked fine. Then I did an Alloy project and Liveview failed again. So must be something related exclusively with Alloy.</li>
