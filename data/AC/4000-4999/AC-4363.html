<h3>Description</h3>

Android aplication succesfull installs when debuging and developing but when packaging for Android app store it wont install in my min target sdk version <uses-sdk android:minSdkVersion="16"/>.

The  problem began after 5.4.0.GA Update. I had to uninstall it and try to build with 5.3.1.GA, as it was working before. I publish the aplication in app store. Also the Appcelerator studio began to ask for 6.0 device, obviusly becaouse it only supports target 23, but it wont take the api directions in manifest.
