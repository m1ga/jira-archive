<h3>Description</h3>

Hi,

#1# I want my application to cover whole screen. I was able to achieve the same (i.e. no status bar or command bar ) by setting fullscreen to true in tiapp.xml. But a user can still swipe up and make the command bar visible. Is there way i can control the swipe such that no command bar is visible or just hide the status bar and not the command bar.

#2# Windows Native code provides property "ApplicationViewBoundsMode.UseVisible" which makes the command bar static (i.e. it cannot be hidden by swiping on the screen). Is there any property in titanium equivalent to it.

   Hello, Currently the feature is not available for Windows platform. As you said the feature is available natively. Please provide the official native guide link about how the feature is done in native platform. We will consider it as a new feature request, And provide the support on upcoming SDK. Thanks. </li>
