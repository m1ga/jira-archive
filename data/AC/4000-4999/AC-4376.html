<h3>Description</h3>

Hi,

My windows phone app crashes on opening a webview more than 7-8 times.

I have followed the clean up process by removing the webview from window and nullifying the object and truning off any event listener, but still face the same issue.

On analysis found , for webview , titanium has release method in case of android to release memory. Do we have anything similar for windows phone.

Any of the above two resolved would be useful.

   Hello, No, Webview release method is only supported on Android. The WebView is on of the most expensive components to create in terms of resources and performance. Every WebView loaded requires its own rendering context and will take a moment to load, regardless of how simple its contents are. For these reasons, it's critical that you are absolutely certain you need a WebView to create a specific functionality in your app. A good rule of thumb is that if you can recreate web content using Titanium native components, then you should do so. Can you send the sample code that regenerates the issue. We will look into your code and possibly give your a recommendation. Thanks.</li>
