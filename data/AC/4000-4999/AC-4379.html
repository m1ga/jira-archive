<h3>Description</h3>

Hi,

I am facing an issue in developing Windows application :

I have a view(view 1) which has another view(view 2) in it which in turn has has multiple child views. On touch end event, I update the left of the view(view 2) such that a particular child view is visible on the phone screen. When i swipe with hard, view 2 moves out of the visible boundaries of view 1 and only touch start/move events are triggered. The touchend/cancel events are not triggered.

How can I make sure touchend or touchcancel events is triggered when view 2 moves outside the area of view2., 

Can also refer to the following link as the issue is same, but is for android with solution as touchcancel event, IN windows touchcancel event is also not triggered:
