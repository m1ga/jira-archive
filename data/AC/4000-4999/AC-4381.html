<h3>Description</h3>

Hi,

I am working on an application for windows platform.
I am facing  the following issue:

When I add event listeners to the elements of my window and open my window in the same function, then in the period when the event listeners are attached to the elements and the window is opened, if I click on the screen where the element would appear, the event is fired. 

I want my event listener to fire event when the window has opened and is visible to the user.
