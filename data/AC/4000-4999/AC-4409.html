<h3>Description</h3>

The thing is that I am trying to send emails from Cloud API. i have created a template, but when I try to set the configuration for SMTP, I got the msg: "The SMTP settings are not valid" and I am pretty sure that they are. Even I have tried with 2 gmail accounts and 1 account that I have in my hosting plan.

Please help me because I really need to finish a project.

Thanks in advance
