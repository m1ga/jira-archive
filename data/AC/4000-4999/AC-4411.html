<h3>Description</h3>

I am having a number of issues trying to get a basic Windows sample app to run either a Windows 8.1 or 10 emulator or even deploy to a Windows Phone Device. I realize this may be multiple issue that need different tickets. 

When trying to run in Windows 10 emulator I receive the following error:
[ERROR] :  Failed to start emulator "10-0-1"
[ERROR] :  Failed to connect to Mobile Emulator 10.0.10240.0 WVGA 4 inch 512MB

When trying to run in Windows 8 emulator the build succeeds but the emulator fails to boot with a UDP port error.

When deploying to a Windows 10 phone device it fails with:
  A Windows Store component with CMake requires both the Windows Desktop SDK
  as well as the Windows Store '10.0' SDK.  Please make sure that you have
  both installed

I have Windows 8.1 SDK + Emulators and Windows 10 SDK + Emulators both installed, Hyper-V is enabled. I am using VS2015. I have pointed my Appcelerator studio the Windows 10 SDK, however I can't can no longer find this option in preferences to try pointing it at Win8 again.

TIMOB-19750 seems related, but should be fixed in 5.4 which I am using.

   Hello,
   
   We have tested in our end and its working for me on following environment:
   SDK: 5.4.0.GA
   Appcelerator Command-Line Interface, version 5.4.0
   Windows: 8.1 (64-bit)
   Windows Emulator: Emulator 8.1 WVGA 4 inch 512MB
   
   Would you please try to follow the below instructions before running application on Appcelerator studio?
   
   1.Open the Visual studio
   2.Make a default simple project
   3.Run to your suitable Emulator (Which you have installed)
   4.Then please open the studio and run it again and let us know.
   
   Also please see the guid from appcelerator doc for [visual studio 2015 setup](<a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#</a>!/guide/Installing_the_Windows_Phone_SDK-section-46254761_InstallingtheWindowsPhoneSDK-SetupVisualStudio2015).
