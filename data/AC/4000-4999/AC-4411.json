I realize this may be multiple issue that need different tickets. \r\n\r\nWhen trying to run in Windows 10 emulator I receive the following error:\r\n[ERROR] :  Failed to start emulator \"10-0-1\"\r\n[ERROR] :  Failed to connect to Mobile Emulator 10.0.10240.0 WVGA 4 inch 512MB\r\n\r\nWhen trying to run in Windows 8 emulator the build succeeds but the emulator fails to boot with a UDP port error.\r\n\r\nWhen deploying to a Windows 10 phone device it fails with:\r\n  A Windows Store component with CMake requires both the Windows Desktop SDK\r\n  as well as the Windows Store '10.0' SDK.  Please make sure that you have\r\n  both installed\r\n\r\nI have Windows 8.1 SDK + Emulators and Windows 10 SDK + Emulators both installed, Hyper-V is enabled. I am using VS2015. I have pointed my Appcelerator studio the Windows 10 SDK, however I can't can no longer find this option in preferences to try pointing it at Win8 again.\r\n\r\nTIMOB-19750 seems related, but should be fixed in 5.4 which I am using.\r\n\r\n",
