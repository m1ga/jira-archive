<h3>Description</h3>

On Studio 4.7.1, I see the following in the IOS devices to run my mobile apps. This doesn't look right? Duplicated somewhat.

   Hello, Looks fine to me. You have support for apple watch simulators. Thanks.</li>

   One would have expected single entry per device? why are they listed next to different versions of iPhones?</li>
<li>Chris Barber 2016-09-18

   The list is (most likely) correct. The device pairs are tied to each Xcode installation. This means the permutations for all iOS Simulator and watchOS Simulators is actually quite large.
   
   We talked about how to better solve this and we came up with the idea of managing our own device pairs. We would no longer list all permutations or list watchOS Simulators, only iOS Simulators and device pairs. Since Titanium would own these device pairs, they would span multiple Xcode installations. I've created TIMOB-23918 to address this.
   
   In the meantime, I will resolve this ticket as invalid.</li>
