		"description": "Hi. Recently my app got rejected from Apple. This was all right few weeks ago. I used 5.1.1.GA and I didn't change anything significant. I also tried to resubmit app with 5.5.0.GA but that didn't go through also.\r\nAlso, noticed this is not isolated issue as one more developer experienced the same issue.\r\nHere is response from Apple:\r\nPerformance - 2.5.1\r\nYour app uses or references the following non-public APIs:\r\nfocus:\r\nThe use of non-public APIs is not permitted on the App Store because it can lead to a poor user experience should these APIs change.\r\nAnd more info about error in Ti SDK:\r\nThank you for your reply. Our team has re-reviewed this app to ensure our findings were accurate, we found this app contains references to the following selectors:\r\n\"focus:\" was found in the method -[TiRootViewController manuallyRotateToOrientation:duration:]\r\nPlease take a look at this asap. Thanks.",
