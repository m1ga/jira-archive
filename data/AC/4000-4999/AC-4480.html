<h3>Description</h3>

Upon submitting an app built with 5.5.0.GA, I receive an automated email from Apple saying the following:

*Missing Push Notification Entitlement *- Your app includes an API for Apple's Push Notification service, but the aps-environment entitlement is missing from the app's signature. To resolve this, make sure your App ID is enabled for push notification in the Provisioning Portal. Then, sign your app with a distribution provisioning profile that includes the aps-environment entitlement. This will create the correct signature, and you can resubmit your app. See "Provisioning and Development" in the Local and Push Notification Programming Guide for more information. If your app does not use the Apple Push Notification service, no action is required. You may remove the API from future submissions to stop this warning. If you use a third-party framework, you may need to contact the developer for information on removing the API.

Here's a link where others discuss it and how to fix it by opening the project in Xcode (they're not using Titanium): <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39554177/xcode-8-the-aps-environment-entitlement-is-missing-from-the-apps-signature-on" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39554177/xcode-8-the-aps-environment-entitlement-is-missing-from-the-apps-signature-on</a>

Perhaps we need a parameter/key for tiapp.xml in the <ios><plist><dict> section?

   Hey there! This is a breaking change from Apple. We changed our docs to guide our developers through the (quick) migration. See TIMOB-23908 for details. Thanks!</li>
