<h3>Description</h3>

Build KitchenSink for iOS 8.4 Simulator using 5.5.0.GA SDK and then try any XHR or Network function and you get 

[INFO] :   error:The network connection was lost.

I have the same problem with two different of our own apps but I'm submitting this bug with KitchenSink 3.5.1 since that is a known test case with source code available to everyone.

If you build KitchenSink for iOS 9 or iOS 10 simulators, everything is fine.

   It is a known iOS 8 simulator issue from Apple: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25372318/error-domain-nsurlerrordomain-code-1005-the-network-connection-was-lost" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25372318/error-domain-nsurlerrordomain-code-1005-the-network-connection-was-lost</a></li>

   I switched to my MacBook which is running Studio 4.7.0.201607250649 and where I can build with the older SDKs (5.4, 5.3, etc) and I'm having the same problem with Error: Network Connection was Lost when trying to run on iOS 8 simulators.  This time I tested with the Rss Reader program just downloaded from the Sample Apps from the Studio Dashboard.  
   
   Did I miss the memo that iOS 8 was being dropped or what?</li>

   Sorry, never mind...  did a web search on stackoverflow but didn't find it. </li>

   Hey Joe, no problem! At least we can ensure it's a native sim issue and it works on the device (QE-tested for every release). Thanks!</li>
