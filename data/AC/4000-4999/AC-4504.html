<h3>Description</h3>

When trying to package app for the App store I get the following error:

[INFO] :   Invoking xcodebuild
[ERROR] :  Error details: Provisioning profile "*******" doesn't include signing certificate "iPhone Distribution: ***** (******)".
[ERROR] :  Error details: Code signing is required for product type 'Application' in SDK 'iOS 10.0'

I have included the new requirements of the team-id in the tiapp.xml

I have cleaned the project and tried mu;title times to package

   Please update your provisioning profiles and ensure that you have the <code><team-id></code> included in your tiapp.xml</li>

   Hi Hans
   
   thank you for the response unfortunately that does not help.
   
   I have placed the team-id in the tiapp.xml and have recreated the provisioning profiles, double clicked the profile and added it to Xcode but the issue still remains.

   Hi,
   
   After searching on stack overflow the solution was found to delete all provisioning profiles from keychain and Xcode and re- add them which allowed me to package the app
   
   thanks for your help</li>
