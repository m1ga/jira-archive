<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>first of all i am using sdk 5.4.0 and after clean the project, The transport.py is a Python script located in my ~/Library/Application Support/Titanium/mobilesdk/osx/<5.4.0>/iphone directory.</h4>
<h4>To run this script on terminal  i follow the below steps.</h4>
<h4>    Open terminal and navigate to my ~/Library/Application Support/Titanium/mobilesdk/osx//iphone directory</h4>
<h4>    Issue the following command  ./transport.py <path to your project directory>  in my case that is ./transport.py /Users/ashishsebastian/Documents/Appcelerator_Studio_Workspace/MachineTransport(project name).</h4>
<h4>Transport.py has now generated a stand alone XCode project for my in  Titanium Projectâ€™s build/iphone directory. </h4>
<h4>After run this xcode i found error in ApplicationRouting.m file ,this file are auto generated after run the project.</h4>
<h4> whole above process find from the link: <a href="https://bencoding.com/2012/04/11/using-titaniums-transport-py/." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://bencoding.com/2012/04/11/using-titaniums-transport-py/.</a></h4>

   <code>transport.py</code> has been deprecated and is no longer supported. It will be removed from Titanium in a future release.</li>

   Thanks Chris,
   But what is the new process to transport the Titanium to xCode.?</li>
<li>Chris Barber 2016-09-28

   [~ashishseb] Just open the generated Xcode project in the <code><project-dir>/build/iphone</code> directory.</li>
<li>Ashish Sebastian 2016-09-28

   But I think that will not work, if we move the xCode to other system, as it does not copies the 'Resource' of the app into the project, we need to manually do that. So could you please let know if appcelerator has updated that feature also and we could use the build folder directly in xCode.</li>
<li>Chris Barber 2016-09-28

   It will probably not work well. The resources are in the built product directory. If you clean the Xcode project, you lose all of the resources.
   
   If we were to detach Titanium from the generated Xcode project, like what <code>transport.py</code> did, then that would undermine our business model and we can't have that. Sorry.</li>
