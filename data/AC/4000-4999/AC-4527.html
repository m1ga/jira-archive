<h3>Description</h3>

Hello,
I'm trying to run an app with the liveview running, but I can't.
When I build and install via Studio I receive this message:
[ERROR] : Failed to install apk on "49OVGEZHUKVK8TH6"
[ERROR] Application Installer abnormal process termination. Process exit value was 1
[ERROR] Application Installer abnormal process termination. Process exit value was 1

I've already followed recommendations like cleaning the project and kill node process and start again.
I've already disabled the firewall and opened all the ports.

I'm attaching the detailed error in a txt file

observation1: When liveview starts, liveview seems actually running fine (if I make a change and save after that, liveview updating routine starts too) UNTIL the error, that I pasted here, appears, then whatever I do liveviews doesn't update.

observation2: The app is installed in the mobile, but it doesn't connect to liveview

observation3: If I use directly the command with the adb to install the apk in the mobile, the adb closes him self with the "not respoding" windows alert.

observation4: Yes, they  are in the same network
observation5: I've tried in 4 mobiles and in 3 differents machines.

Thanks

   Please can someone take a look at it!? 
   I suppose that by this bug being in Windows and most of the effort is made for Mac, it may take a little while for someone dirt hands on it(I know because I worked solving bugs before - I kind know how priority works around teams).
   
   I'm comming to this message because I really need to put liveview working on mobile then I can a(pp)celerate the production, great?</li>

   Hello, Are you still having the issue? Try with the latest studio release. Thanks.</li>
<li>Pedro Nascimento 2016-11-07

   Hello, thanks for the reply
   So, I tried in two devices and the behavior is the same as in the issue description, nothing changed .
   
   The news is that I got to use live reload using TIShadow <a href="https://github.com/dbankier/TiShadow" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/dbankier/TiShadow</a>
   
   I build the app using tishadow (ti build ..... --shadow) and install manually in the mobile, when I enter in the app, it's asked for my ip adress, when I enter the Ip, every saved change in the code changes in the mobile too.
   
   if you take a look you might get ideas, just saying.
   
   But anyway, is there some data in my build log that might be useful for this issue?
   </li>

   Mello, Make sure your devices are connected properly. To check that run "appc info" in terminal and check the log. If the CLI does not detect the connected device then this is not liveview issue. This is device configuration issue. Let us know. Thanks.</li>

   I did make sure, Studio Appcelerator recognize my mobiles.
   By the way, when I run $appc info -l trace, 
   I get

   Hi,
   We recommend you to upgrade your studio 4.8.0 and SDK, CLI 6.0.0.GA.
    *Note :*
   1. Check to make sure your computer and device are on the same wireless network.
   2. LiveView requires the following ports to be open: 8323 and 8324
   
   If you get error again please include your studio log.
   
   Regards,
   Aminul </li>
<li>Pedro Nascimento 2016-11-21

   Ok, updated the Ti SDK  Studio and appc CLI, my node and ADB is still the same.
   
   If I run in Studio the output is the same, 
   
   {{INFO] :   Installing app on device: LG-E455

   but if I run from the CLI, the output has changed, when I run :
   appc ti build -p android -T device --liveview 
   the liveview says:

   Hello, Liveview works fine with Windows phone. This seems to be device issue for LG-E455 device. There might be some permissions missing. Can you try with any other device? Let us know. Thanks.</li>
