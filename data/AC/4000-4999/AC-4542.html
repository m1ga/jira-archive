<h3>Description</h3>

"[WARN] :   View: NonHTCWebView not displayed because it is too large to fit into a software layer (or drawing cache), needs 5886720 bytes, only 3686400 available"

I basically load a Ti.UI.WebView with some html data (nothing fancy, only text/links/markup). It breaks because apparently it overflows some memory setting. Only very few webviews (say 20 lines of text) stay under the memory limit and are rendered.

For now I am rolling back to 5.3.1.GA.

   Hello, Please share a sample test code that regenerates the issue. Can you try with SDK 5.5.1.GA. Thanks.</li>

   It can be resolved by disabling hardware acceleration, but this may have an appwide impact. It would be ideal if we could limit to the webview component only. However, there is an issue with the new SDK with regards to this. If I can come up with a test app today I will post some example code.
   
   under the manifest in tiapp.xml
   add the property
   
   <code><pre>
   android:hardwareAccelerated="false"
   </pre></code>
   
   to the <application> element
   
   
   *This is an extreme fix, and just a patch really*</li>

   This should not be closed unless it has been fixed in SDK 6+.  I will try get some time to create a test case to demonstrate the issue.</li>

   Is there a way of targeting the web view component only - not the entire application? Via activities ?
   
   I haven't figured a way of doing this yet. Working on it.</li>
