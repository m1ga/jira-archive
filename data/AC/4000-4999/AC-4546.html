<h3>Description</h3>

Yesterday I published the Android version of an app; later I found out it used the development config in <code>config.json</code> instead of production.

I have had this issue once before and it is likely because of the message:

<code>[INFO] :   [config.json] config.json unchanged, using cached config.json...</code>

I've got a strong feeling this isnt working properly. I had just updated my config.json, (I believe without using <code>AppcStudio -&gt; Project -&gt; Clean...</code> before I packaged the project) and it used the development config.

Later I built the iOS app (not knowing the issue on the Android package yet) and it appeared to build correctly.

I hereby suggest: dont use any sort of "cache"  function for such simple files as <code>config.json</code>. This file is likely not gonna be bigger than 200 lines and not caching it is probably the easiest fix.

   Thanks for your request. It's always better to do a clean in the project before the production build. </li>

   Please reopen this report. If you change something in the config.json, it sometimes doesnt recognize that change. Unfortunately I cant reproduce a testcase. It might be OS dependent (Mac/Windows/Linux).
   
   The easiest fix is to exclude this config.json from being cached and I think that is a much safer solution since its such an important file to have correct. I'm sure more people have encountered this issue.</li>
