<h3>Description</h3>

I'm creating this ticket just to give you an idea that other tools are using to create a sort of pattern on how to get the users environment.
Some other tools I have used are generating a file called "environment.txt" in the "build" folder, so when some user needs to open a new ticket he just have to upload this file and you have 100% sure what's the user environment.

This is just an idea :)
