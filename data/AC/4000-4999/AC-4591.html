<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Steps to Reproduce</h4>
I have attached the app.js I used to recreate the problem in a new project.  
1) Click on the text area
2) Type in a couple of words followed by a lightning bolt emoji (not the cloud one).
3) Hit enter 
4) Click on the textarea again to gain focus  


<h4>Actual Result</h4>
The text will reformat by adding what looks to be kerning.  If you set a specific font in your text area the results are even more spectacular with it changing to courier.  I have also found that the embarrased face in iOS 10 causes the result.

iOS9 emojis all seem fine.  Perhaps it's just the re-touched iOS10 emojis.


<h4>Expected Result</h4>
That the font settings remain the same as when they were entered the first time as will all other emojis

   He Brad, we need more info here:
   - You talk about certain emojis, which ones?
   - Can you attach a video demonstrating the issue?
   
   I'm curious if this might be a native issue, because emojis are nothing but utf-8 characters that are handled without any custom logic. In fact, we don't have any emoji specific code in our core.</li>

   Hi,
   
   [^Movie1.mov] shows the lightning bolt in IOS 10.  [^Movie2.mov] shows an embarassed face that is OK and one that isn't.  We have only found these during testing of our app in iOS10 and these were by accident.
   
   I had a look into the SDK and couldn't find any emoji specific code either so that's why I raised it since you fine people would have better luck finding out what it might be.
   
   These are the only ones that we found so far - we haven't completed a full sweep of all emojis.
   As you can see in the video, the emoji also needs to be the last item typed.  If you type a space or anything after there is no problem.  Adding a space programattically to the text entered does not mask the problem either. It seems that the text has to be entered in the Text Area to count.
   
   Kind regards,
   Brad.

   Hui, I just reproduced it with a native test-case, good catch! The good thing is that our SDK does not cause the issue, the bad thing is that iOS does. I will get in touch with Apple and update this ticket with the results. Thx!</li>

   I received feedback from Apple regarding it: It is a known issue and is being investigated!</li>
