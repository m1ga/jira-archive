<h3>Description</h3>

Application works perfectly until it is closed with back button. If so, than after restart it is showing splash screen and becoming non-responsive. After some time dialog (if I want to close the app) may show. It happens with any code. For example:

<code><pre>
var myApp = {};
alert(1);
alert(2);
</pre></code>

If app is closed in hard way (third button and swiping app out) than everything is fine. Same if it is forced to close after it hangs.

Problem occurs on every Android version both on device and simulator. After some test I found it occurs on SDK 5.2.0 and newer (does not occur on 5.1.0-5.1.1)
