   [~iblack.dum] Did you create or download those modules? I couldn't find them in our marketplace. Can you please paste the TRACE level log output?</li>
<li>Sathaphorn Kerdmalai 2016-11-16

   i created by myself and i already changed sdk to 6.0.0GA.</li>
<li>Chris Barber 2016-11-16

   Again, please attach the TRACE level log output. Can you also please verify the <code>apiversion</code> in each of your module's <code>manifest</code> files?</li>
<li>Chris Barber 2016-11-16

   Also, how are you building your modules? Are you building them from Studio or from the CLI? If you're building them from the CLI, are you using the <code>build.py</code> or are you calling <code>appc run -p -ios --build-only</code></li>
<li>Sathaphorn Kerdmalai 2016-11-17

   Here is manifest file.
   [^manifest]
   and i used  ./build.py in each project to build module.</li>
<li>Chris Barber 2016-11-17

   [~iblack.dum] You're module is out-of-date and no longer compatible with Titanium. In Titanium SDK 6.0.0 we added apiversion validation. iOS is on apiversion 2 and yours is apiversion 1. You must update your module to the latest apiversion and APIs as well as use the Appc CLI to build your module.
   
   We unfortunately do not have a migration tool, however the upgrade shouldn't be too difficult. First, start by creating a new module project by running <code>appc new</code> and selecting new Titanium Module. After creating a new project, <code>cd &lt;my module&gt;/iphone</code> and run <code>appc run -p ios --build-only</code>. Make sure things build.
   
   Then copy your module source and resources over into the new module project and rebuild. There maybe a few hiccups, but it should work.</li>

   Thank you. 
   That means i have to recreate all modules if i change to use 6.0.0 GA. Am i right?
   </li>
<li>Chris Barber 2016-11-17

   You only need to update the iOS modules with apiversion 1 or stick with Titanium 5.5.1.GA.</li>
<li>Chris Barber 2016-11-17

   Resolving as invalid since iOS modules built for apiversion 1 are indeed not compatible with Titanium SDK 6.</li>
