<h3>Description</h3>

Prospect is reporting severe performance issues developing on his environment.

Could you please confirm is such issue is expected with 8GB RAM. 
HAXM support no longer to be available in Windows 10. Can you please confirm this? 

Any expected/normal behaviour, when compared to running the app on a Mac computer with same specs (8GB RAM)? 

Any suggestions? Is it possible to better undertand the stem of the issue by getting the log files from prospect/client?
