<h3>Description</h3>

When creating an annotation with transparency below a specific size (haven't figured out the exact size yet on which it triggers) the annotation doesn't show up when having the images in density specific folders.

However, moving the images to the "images" folder in assets/android it will work. Increasing size or removing transparency also fixes the problem.

Attached are 2 projects displaying the problem and the solution. Both are the same project but file structure is different.

In the projects there are 4 annotations. Small one with transparency is the one with the problem. Small one without transparency works just fine. A bigger image (basically increased size 30%) will work in all situations.

   Hello, I tried reproducing your issue with SDK 6.0.0.GA in Android 6.0.1 device. I wasn't able to reproduce the issue as you described. All four annotations show accordingly for both sample project. (despite images in density specific folder or assets/android folder. I am using map 3.0.1 for Android. Here are my environment details.
