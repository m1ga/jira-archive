<h3>Description</h3>

When setting a theme and building for iOS, missing images are generated from the default theme not the theme currently in use.

In our case appicon-83.5@2x and appicon-Small-40@3x were missing from both our default theme as well as a secondary theme.  When building for our secondary theme these were autogenerated however they were based off images from the default theme and therefore incorrect for the theme we were building for.

A DefaultIcon.png is in our root folder, and even if I put the right images in the theme directory it was still using images made from the DefaultIcon.png.  Once I deleted DefaultIcon.png the theme images were used as expected.

   I thought this could be closed but I am still seeing an issue in what is being placed in the build folder.</li>

   Hello, Can you send a sample project that regenerates the issue for iOS platform? It will be a lot of help if we can reproduce the issue on our end. Also, please provide a guide on how to regenerate the issue. Thanks.</li>
