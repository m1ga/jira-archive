<h3>Description</h3>

When retrieving the calendar events, the calendar events seem to have IDs that are small integers. For example, one event has an ID of "62". This seemed odd when comparing it to previous IDs found to be retrieved from Android.

I am wondering if there are some missing values that are not being exposed in Titanium's implementation of the newer versions of Android.

Currently, our "hacky" fix for this has been to take the Ti.Calendar.Event.id value, and concatenate it to an ISO-8601 version of the start date. That has given us a somewhat-unique ID for the event. This makes me uncomfortable, so I wanted to have a properly-implemented way of accessing a unique ID.

   Hello, Share a sample code to test the issue. </li>
<li>Kiley Williams 2016-12-15

   Sample:
   
   <code><pre>
   // rawDeviceCalendarEvent is an instance of Ti.Calendar.Event
   
   var currentEventData = {
                   id: rawDeviceCalendarEvent.getId(),
                   title: rawDeviceCalendarEvent.getTitle(),
                   location: rawDeviceCalendarEvent.getLocation(),
                   description: itemDescription
               };
   
   Ti.API.log(currentEventData.id); // This will output a small number for an ID on Android as mentioned in the description above.
   </pre></code>

   Hello, Can you send a full reproducible code for us to test? We need to regenerate the issue before our engineer's can look into it. Thanks.</li>
