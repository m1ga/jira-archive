<h3>Description</h3>

If I create a new mobile app project and try to Run from appcelerator studio 4.8 I get the simulator to come up, but the app never installs and runs.  

Here is the log from the console with trace on.
<code><pre>
[TRACE] :  Signing Identity:     "-"

</pre></code>

It sits at this point until I kill the simulator and then I get this:
<code><pre>
[TRACE] :  [ioslib] iPad Retina Simulator has exited with code 0
[TRACE] :  [ioslib] Exited with code: 0
</pre></code>

I've tried other simulators as well (10.2 versions).

   Hello, Does the same thing happen when you run through terminal? Can you share "appc info" log in here? </li>
<li>Christy Thomas 2016-12-16

   appc run -p ios --log-level trace  --deploy-type development --force
   
   I ran the above command and saw the same problem.  Simulator launches, but the app does not.
   
   In the Environment field of this ticket is my "appc info" data.</li>

   I tried to run the app in the simulator from the command line with this command:
   xcrun simctl launch --console EE9A4B2C-EE49-4DA1-A036-854FBDCAD585 build/iphone/build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/New60Blank.app
   
   Have you seen this before?
   <code><pre>
   An error was encountered processing the command (domain=FBSOpenApplicationServiceErrorDomain, code=1):
   The request to open "build/iphone/build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/New60Blank.app" failed.
   The request was denied by service delegate (SBMainWorkspace) for reason: NotFound ("Application "build/iphone/build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/New60Blank.app" is unknown to FrontBoard").
   </pre></code>
   
   The New60Blank.app was built with the appc run command in my previous comment.</li>

   If I open the resulting .xcodeproj file in Xcode and run the project via Xcode the application will launch in the simulator.</li>

   Last night I got an automatic update for Xcode. As a new functionality, simulator performs a new way to install apps via drag&drop. Seems to be that Apple made changes to simulator. I restored to last Xcode-version and simulator starts apps again.</li>

   What version of Xcode should I be using?  I have 8.2 (8C38) right now.  This was a new machine that I just setup with Seirra and Xcode on Wednesday.</li>
<li>Andreas Graetz 2016-12-16

   8.1 (8B62) works well</li>
<li>Christy Thomas 2016-12-16

   Thanks.  I am on Xcode 8.1 now and it's working.</li>

   This is a duplicate of the (fixed) issue TIMOB-24136, we will release the 6.0.1 patch version next week!</li>
