<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>The app can no longer be run in the simulator, and when I run it on the device it crashes on every recompile. This was not an issue before the CLI update.</h4>

   Hello, Does it happens for Android or iOS? Can you attach the crash log in here? We will look into that. </li>

   This was using the iOS simulator. It launches the simulator but it never seems to be able to load the app. I did see a recent Xcode update also so that may be the culprit. 
   
   The application seems to work OK on the device, initially it was crashing when I made changes to the TSS but it seems to have resolved itself after a few clean project commands, logging out, and a reboot. If it happens again I will provide an error log.</li>

   Hey Michael, could this be related to the (fixed) issue in TIMOB-24136?</li>
<li>Michael Thornton 2016-12-18

   Definitely seems to be related. I will wait until an official update is released, can't risk breaking anything else during this development cycle. Will use the device until patched.
   
   Thanks!</li>

   Could you let us know what CLI version you are using? <code>appc -v -o json</code> And also the version of the SDK you are using?
   
   I assume based on you comment that you are using Xcode 8.1, but if not please let me know.</li>

   Hello, This blog post is the fix to this problem when using Xcode 8.2 <a href="https://www.appcelerator.com/blog/2016/12/updating-to-xcode-8-2-and-sdk-6-0-1/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.appcelerator.com/blog/2016/12/updating-to-xcode-8-2-and-sdk-6-0-1/</a> </li>
