<h3>Description</h3>

I am creating a calendar event using below code

<code><pre>
var CALENDAR_TO_USE = 1;
var calendar = Ti.Calendar.getCalendarById(CALENDAR_TO_USE);

// Create the event
var eventBegins = new Date(2010, 11, 26, 12, 0, 0);
var eventEnds = new Date(2010, 11, 26, 14, 0, 0);
var details = {
    title: 'Do some stuff',
    description: "I'm going to do some stuff at this time.",
    begin: eventBegins,
    end: eventEnds
};

var event = calendar.createEvent(details);

// Now add a reminder via e-mail for 10 minutes before the event.
var reminderDetails = {
    minutes: 10,
    method: Ti.Calendar.METHOD_EMAIL
};

event.createReminder(reminderDetails);
</pre></code>

   Hello, This is not available for Android in our platform yet. Currently, only support for iOS. If this support in native Android, you can provide sufficient data about this related to native platform. And we will consider this a new feature request. Thanks.</li>

    Hey [~dev.sp],
    
    the Ti.Calendar.Attendee API was added in 6.0.0.GA for iOS to *fetch* attendees from all calendar events. It is read-only because you cannot set Calendar attendees programmatically with iOS at this time (see [this link](<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/28854748/5537752)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://stackoverflow.com/a/28854748/5537752)</a> for more info). For Android, we could think of parity and actually have a ticket for that (TIMOB-17450), but it's also focussing on *getting* the attendees, rather then *saving* them.
    
    For those cases, rather use the <code>[Ti.Calendar.Calendar.createEvent()](<a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#</a>!/api/Titanium.Calendar.Calendar-method-createEvent)</code> method on the desired Calendar (e.g. <code>Ti.Calendar.defaultCalendar</code>) to create the event with the native UI.</li>
