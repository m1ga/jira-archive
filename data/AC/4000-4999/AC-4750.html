<h3>Description</h3>

Is there a way that we can actually retrieve the arp table of the router that a app connected to? so that we can find the IP address of any device that is connected to same netowork. app built using titanium API

Scenario:
1. I have a iPad application that need paired with a payment device.
2. payment device a mac address and when it connects to network it gets a IP address but it keep changing.
3. if i have a option in the API to lookup the IP of this device using the mac address i can actually do the pairing process so easy.

   Hey there,
   
   iOS does not have a public API for it, so we can't expose it as well. There are some native hacks to get the mac-address from a current IP address, but that's not what you're looking for I guess. See [this StackOverflow](<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31226522/ios-get-arp-table)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31226522/ios-get-arp-table)</a> for more infos.</li>
