<h3>Description</h3>

This happens whenever I try to run the application on a real device including a specific module (in this case the PSPDFKit module).

I get a generic error from Appcelerator Studio saying:

<code><pre>
[ERROR] : An error occurred during build after 1m 41s 862ms 
[ERROR] : Failed to install app on device (0xe800002d) 
[ERROR] : For some reason the app failed to install on the device. Try reconnecting your device and check your provisioning profile and entitlements.
</pre></code>

if I manually install the new generated ipa on the device I get the error from the console:

<code><pre>
mobile_installation_proxy(MobileSystemServices)[173]: 0x16df17000 handle_install: Installation failed: Error Domain=MIInstallerErrorDomain Code=13 
"Failed to verify code signature of /private/var/installd/Library/Caches/com.apple.mobile.installd.staging/temp.O4m8As/extracted/Payload/xxx.app/Frameworks/PSPDFKit.framework : 0xe8008019 (The application does not have a valid signature.)" 
UserInfo={LibMISErrorNumber=-402620391, LegacyErrorString=ApplicationVerificationFailed, SourceFileLine=147, FunctionName=+[MICodeSigningVerifier _validateSignatureAndCopyInfoForURL:withOptions:error:], NSLocalizedDescription=
Failed to verify code signature of /private/var/installd/Library/Caches/com.apple.mobile.installd.staging/temp.O4m8As/extracted/Payload/xxx.app/Frameworks/PSPDFKit.framework : 0xe8008019 (The application does not have a valid signature.)}
</pre></code>

this doesn't happen in applications that don't include that module.

   Hello, Please share a sample project with the module included. We need to verify the issue. </li>
<li>Alberto Marcone 2017-02-24

   you can get a sample app from here:
   
   <a href="https://github.com/PSPDFKit/Appcelerator-iOS/blob/master/example/app.js" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/PSPDFKit/Appcelerator-iOS/blob/master/example/app.js</a>
   
   for a module demo key I'm going to page Peter, the creator and founder of PSPDFKit.</li>
<li>Peter Steinberger 2017-02-24

   You can get a demo of our SDK here: <a href="https://pspdfkit.com/#trynow" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://pspdfkit.com/#trynow</a>
   
   Just enter any data into the text fields, the demo link and eval license is all fully autogenerated.
   Ping me at peter@pspdfkit.com if you have any troubles and I can send you a custom eval license; just need your app bundle ID.</li>

   Hello, [~a.marcone], you should follow up with [~steipete]. It's your pspdfkit's licence issue. Thanks.</li>

   It's not a licensing issue - our licensing does not prevent the app to compile/link but would throw an exception at runtime. This is not the case here.
   
   The issue likely stems from the fact that we use a dynamic framework and somehow it's not correctly signed when Appcelerator builds the Xcode project.
   The PSPDFKit.framework is unsigned at distribution time based on Apple's best practices and needs to be signed at app build time (Xcode usually does that automatically)</li>

   Hello [~a.marcone],
   
   I think PSPDFKit.framework is a dynamic framework. That's why its showing error. 
   
   Please visit <a href="https://github.com/csemrm/hook-embedded-frameworks" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/csemrm/hook-embedded-frameworks</a> 
   
   Hope its solve your problem.
   
   Thanks

   Hello [~a.marcone], Did you follow up with Mostafizur Rahman's guide? </li>

    Hello, Please update on your current progress. Is the issue still there?</li>
<li>Alberto Marcone 2018-06-27

    I never gave any feedback, but the problem is still happening with the same library.
    
    [TRACE] :  ** BUILD SUCCEEDED **
    [INFO] :   Finished building the application in 28s 131ms
    [INFO] :   Installing app on device: iPad

    [ERROR] :  For some reason the app failed to install on the device. Try reconnecting your device and check your provisioning profile and entitlements.
    
    Just to recap the problem:
    
    - We follow the [steps](<a href="https://github.com/PSPDFKit/Appcelerator-iOS#how-to-build)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/PSPDFKit/Appcelerator-iOS#how-to-build)</a> to build and install the module
    - We run an empry project.
