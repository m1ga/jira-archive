<h3>Description</h3>


I tried to send a image to Cloud got from the systemFile in Android  and it fails, 
It was working, but suddenly it's not working anymore
It works fine in iPhone, but not Android, .

Runtime error:
Location:httpclient.js
Message:
Uncaugth attempt to invoke virtual method 'char[] java.lang.String.toCharArray()' on a null object reference.
Source:
_send.call(this,options);

The code:

	Titanium.Media.openPhotoGallery({
	success:function(event) {
		alert(event.media);//prints [object blob]
		Cloud.Photos.create({
								photo: event.media,
								collection_id: idStringCollection,
								su_id : IdStringUser
							}, function (evt) {
								alert("what");//alert never printed because the runtime error
							});
	},
	error:function(error) {
		//whatever is that function
	}
});

Can someone help me in this?
