<h3>Description</h3>

The above methods only work on blobs retreived from the camera, for the gallery the blob is there and can be set to an image view for instance, but cannot use these methods:

imageAsThumbnail
imageAsResize

Somehow I cannot set the current version above. :( the version was GA 6.0.1

   Hi
   
   I do not have the time to give you a sample at this moment, I found out that Ti.Utils.SHA1 does give the same problem.
   
   I will get back to you when I have deployed 3 mobile apps this week on both platform. Chances are I will need time next week to to get back to you. I am suspecting it is a compatibility problem, since more APIs are not working. I looked at the SDKs and could see that I targeted API 23, with the latest 6.0.1 GA, maybe these are not completely compatible?</li>
