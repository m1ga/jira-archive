<h3>Description</h3>

Hi,
I am trying to save the smtp settings for the g-suite account but not able to. There are two ways i am able to get it saved successfully
1. TLS enabled with port 465.
2. TLS disabled with port 587.

But with the above settings i get the test email of settings saves successfully, but after that when i trigger the email using ti.cloud module, nothing happens no email comes. I see the logs and it says status 200, but email never comes also i can see the logs of the test mail sent about settings saved in the google admin console but not the emails i trigger through the ti.cloud

I spoke to google g-suite support, as per them TLS enabled only works with port 587 and TLS disabled works only with 465, in which case my settings are not saved and i get error of smtp settings are not valid. Please help me out.

I also raised an issue previously but i am not able to see it, it's not there in my raised issues.

   @ishansingh2003@gmail.com, can you please provide your app key?</li>
<li>Wei Kong 2017-03-21

   Can you please try port 587 with tls set to true. </li>
<li>Sharif AbuDarda 2017-03-23

   Hello [~ishansingh2003], Can you follow up on @wei kong's comment?</li>
<li>Ishan Singh 2017-03-23

   Hi [~wkong],
   I have tried every possible combination, if you read the description I wrote above you will find it.
   There should be a detailed log when there is some error in the SMTP settings, so that a user can see what's the issue, not just SMTPS settings are not valid error.</li>
<li>Wei Kong 2017-03-23

   I'm seeing failures like 
   
   "job_name" : "Mail", "message" : "end of file reached", "status" : 400
   
   
   can you please test with a simple test email? </li>
<li>Ishan Singh 2017-03-23

   I tested that,
   But for that my settings should be saved for smtp.</li>
<li>Wei Kong 2017-03-23

   what do you mean? this is an error coming out of your test email I see in the log. it is not related to saving settings. it is an error the smpt server returned . </li>
<li>Ishan Singh 2017-03-23

    Can you please share the logs here ?</li>
<li>Wei Kong 2017-03-23

    i did can you see it now? </li>
<li>Ishan Singh 2017-03-23

    The to email id is ishansingh2003@gmail.com, not Ishan@gmail.com. I have passed the first one. Lemme verify it</li>
<li>Wei Kong 2017-03-23

    are you having issue with sending email on dashboard when setting smtp or sending email using our api? the log is for api only. I don't have information on dashboard. would have to involve another team. </li>
<li>Ishan Singh 2017-03-23

    I have issue with both</li>
<li>Ishan Singh 2017-03-24

    This is the setting i am using, i am getting a test email of smtp settings saved. After that when i trigger from app or curl, no email comes.</li>
<li>Ishan Singh 2017-03-24

    Please see the attached file.</li>
<li>Wei Kong 2017-03-24

    i changed to tls true with port 587 and tested it. it is working. Can you try it? Did you try this combo before? </li>
<li>Ishan Singh 2017-03-24

    I tried with TLS to true, but it was not saving the smtp settings saying settings are not valid.
    Is there an issue with the Appcelerator Settings saving ?</li>
<li>Ishan Singh 2017-03-24

    And yes, Its working now. But it should not be like this. from my end also if i give the same settings with tls to true, it should save the settings instead giving error.</li>
<li>Ishan Singh 2017-03-24

    You can see this screenshot, from dashboard we from our end save the settings you just change from the backend.</li>
<li>Ishan Singh 2017-03-24

    The screenshot is of the another app, i am trying to save smtp settings for.
    As user cannot raise a ticket everytime. Please look into this.</li>
<li>Wei Kong 2017-03-24

    [~sdarda] can you please file a dashboard ticket on this? I don't know why dashboard won't let the user same tls to true when 587 is used </li>
<li>Ishan Singh 2017-03-25

    Thanks, i will try to create another issue and give this issue reference. 
    Please don't close this until i raise an issue there.</li>
<li>Ishan Singh 2017-03-27

    You again shifted that issue to somewhere else, without even letting me know. You should have atleast let me know where it is moved ?</li>
