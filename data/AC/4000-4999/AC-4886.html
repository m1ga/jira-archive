<h3>Description</h3>

{quote}
As a developer,
I want to have the podfile target modified to match the project name,
So that the project can build successfully.
{quote}

Since the podfile target must match the project name that is defined in the tiapp.xml file, it would be nice if the CLI could modify the target to match whatever the current project name is.

   I saw the discussion on Slack earlier this week. And after thinking about it, I'd like to not do this. Primarily, because we want to adapt the native Cocoapods behavior as much as possible. Doing this tightens the external dependencies again and could cause problems once they change the Podfile structure. In addition to that, re-writing the file to the filesystem will slow down the build and the target won't change per app. Finally, Hyperloop will support more targets in the future, that's also why Cocoapods went to target-based Pods. Writing the name manually will cause major problems linking the correct Pods to it's targets. That's why I would propose to go with the current behavior and work as native as possible. Deal?</li>
