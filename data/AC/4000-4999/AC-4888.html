<h3>Description</h3>

When trying to open a window (that was working before, on SDK 5.5.1.GA), app crashes with the log below:

{noformat}
[ERROR] TiExceptionHandler: (main) [2686,6392] ----- Titanium Javascript Runtime Error -----
[ERROR] TiExceptionHandler: (main) [0,6392] - In ti:/events.js:137,4

{noformat}

It seems to be an issue within titanium's core.

PS: Project is classic, not Alloy.

   Sounds like something related to the <code>hide()</code>, check that you only perform that method on valid views and provide a test-case if it still happens.</li>

   @hans I had a couple of <code><pre>hide()</pre></code>, but I commented all and the bug is still happening.
   This window of my app is really big, with loads of proprietary code, so I will keep trying to work this around before providing you a test-case...
   I just need some hints about what could this be, since the log doesn't show much...

   Hello, run a log level trace -l trace on your project and attach the log here. Thanks.</li>
<li>Caio Perdona 2017-03-30

   @Sharif this is already --log-level trace
   No additional logs are being shown...</li>
<li>Sharif AbuDarda 2017-03-30

   In that case we need a sample project/code for us to test. Please provide that. Thanks.</li>
<li>Caio Perdona 2017-04-04

   @Sharif since the window that has this code has around 2,5k lines, providing a test case isn't a trivial task.
   I will try to provide you this, but it can take some time.
   That doesn't mean that the issue is resolved...</li>
