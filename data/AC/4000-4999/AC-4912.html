   Hello, Your issue is not clear, Native Android app?? "As of Release 3.2.0, any application properties defined in the tiapp.xml file are stored in the device's secure storage, making them read-only." See docs:<a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#</a>!/api/Titanium.App.Properties. Thanks.</li>

   Hello, Any information that are stored ti.app.properties are stored in the device's secure storage, making them read-only. Also for native Android you should ask on their support portal. Thanks.</li>
