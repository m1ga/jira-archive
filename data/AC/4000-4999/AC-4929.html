<h3>Description</h3>

Very straightforward - have a tablet (Motorola Xoom) running Android 4.0.4. Created a new, clean Titanium app using SDK 6.0.3.GA (also tried with 6.0.0.GA) and tried to run on the device. App crashes immediately after (during?) the splash screen with no indication as to why in logcat. 

Re-trying using SDK 5.5.0.GA works without issue...

   Hello, The reason is straight forward. Android API (android-14-18) is too old and is no longer supported by Titanium SDK 6.0.3. Thanks. </li>

   In that case, can someone update the compatibility matrix (<a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#</a>!/guide/Titanium_Compatibility_Matrix). It clearly states that for Titanium SDK 5.1.0 to latest, 4.0.x (API 14) is the minimum Android SDK supported. I haven't been able to find any documentation specifying the minimum Android version supported for Titanium 6.0.x... and we based our development work on the Titanium documents. Now it seems we can no longer support some of our users who are on older Android versions... </li>
