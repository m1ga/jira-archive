<h3>Description</h3>

Steps:

<h4>appc new -t arrow arrow-test-3</h4>
<h4>cd arrow-test-3</h4>
<h4>appc run</h4>
<h4>open http://localhost:8080/api/greet</h4>

Expected:  JSON response
Actual:  HTTP 401 Error

This is also happening with other endpoints.
And, yes, I am an admin for organization

   [~brentonhouse], all API Builder APIs have security by default, so accessing the url in a browser like that wont work (by default), so in order to nteract with the APIs you can use curl (for the example Greet endpoint, <code>curl http://localhost:8080/api/Greet?username="Brenton" -u &lt;APIKEY&gt;:</code>, where APIKEY is what API Builder prints out on startup. You could also use a tool like Postman if you prefer
   
   Now, there is another option but that is only for autogenerated model APIs, and programmatic APIs (ones in /api folder) *for now*, you can use the API Builder Console to interact with your APIs, visit http://localhost:8080/console, and navigate to the API Docs & Test tab, here you can interact and try out your APIs from within the browser. This is not provided for the new Swagger defined endpoints added in 2.0.0, but it will be included in the next release, which should be soon.</li>
