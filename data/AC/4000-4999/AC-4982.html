<h3>Description</h3>

After providing a provisioning profile uuid as part of the run command you are still prompted to choose one from a list. This requires user input and breaks automated builds on our build server. This never used to happen, looks like this property is no longer respected?

I have been back and forth with your poor support team for several days on this with Fazlul. He seems to think this is a 'feature' that confirms your uuid selection, when it fact it looks like a regression issue.

   [~joef] This is probably due to a known issue, CLI-1208. To workaround this issue I would suggest to either downgrade to 6.2.0 or add an extra 'throwaway' argument to the command you're using that will get removed.</li>

   Hey Ewan, Thanks for this! Adding the extra throwaway flag does the trick for now. </li>

   [~joef], We shipped 6.2.2 CLI yesterday with the fix for CLI-1208, just a heads up in case you want to remove that throwaway flag :)</li>
