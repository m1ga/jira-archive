<h3>Description</h3>

Our company developed an app using the classic version a few years ago(javascript, not alloy).
Is there any special issue with  IOS11? 64bit? 

Look at below link

   [~boaz@e-drivetech.com] Titanium added support for 64-bit builds in SDK 3.5.0.GA see <a href="http://www.appcelerator.com/blog/2015/01/titanium-sdk-3-5-0-ga-now-available-with-64-bit-ios-support/." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.appcelerator.com/blog/2015/01/titanium-sdk-3-5-0-ga-now-available-with-64-bit-ios-support/.</a> So if your application was build and published using an SDK from then on, you'll be good.</li>

   Hey there! [~eharris] is correct, 64 bit compatibility is inside Titanium since it was announced. For iOS 11 in general, current apps will run the same as before, buildung with the iOS 11 / Xcode 9 tooling is also already implemented and will be available in line with the Xcode 9 / iOS 11 release in September. Thanks!</li>
