<h3>Description</h3>

I've never encountered this problem before.  I haven't launched studio in about a week.  Starting today, when I launch, I successfully get past the "Validating Studio" screen but then at the "Loading Studio" screen everything just hangs.

I've force-quit and reloaded many times with the same result.  Reboot with same result.   

I've attached the report that happens when I force quit.  Let me know if there is any other data point.  Im stuck in the water

   Ok I solved the issue by going to "appc login" from the command line, and then launching the app all worked.  Seems weird?

   A quick workaround is, do logout from the terminal and login again and then launch the studio.
   
   To identify the root cause, whenever studio get into this state - ask them to capture the thread dump for the studio which is mentioned here - <a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#</a>!/guide/Crashes_and_Freezes

   [~johngoodland] - Unfortunately No. We have to go to terminal and do logout and login again. 
   
   Will work this on priority with your help, could you please share your studio thread dumps while it was stuck on studio spash screen. That would help me to see where is the problem.
   
   Please follow the below link to capture thread dumps.

   *From the above doc:*
   <h4>Open a command prompt.</h4>
   <h4>Type jps -v shows you a list of jvm process ids. You should see one referencing Eclipse.</h4>
   <h4>Type jstack <pid> >> logfile.logto dump the stack trace for the specified VM process id. Copy this into a file and attach it to the JIRA ticket. You may need to pipe the output to a location where you have write permissions, i.e.:</h4>
   
   c:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_29\bin>jstack 2616 >> "C:\Users\Username\Desktop\test2.log"

   That's right!, only thread dumps are useful in this case. However, will analyze by invalidating the session and see if we can able to reproduce the problem.

   I had the same problem today with Axway Studio 4.10.0.201709271713
   force quit,
   then terminal appc login,
   restart the app seemed to work.

   Not sure why this is closed as fixed, it is still happening in Axway Studio 5.1.1.201809051655.</li>
