<h3>Description</h3>

I wish to force my existing clients from http:// > https:// to do this I have automatic https rewrites turned on on my domain.

This works fine on iOS, the 301 redirect is followed and the HTTPClient follows the redirect. On Android this is not the case. I am using the latest SDK 6.1.0GA (all SDK versions have this bug as far as I can see).

For example if you go to: <a href="http://uk.markive.co.uk" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://uk.markive.co.uk</a> you will see in Chrome the 301 redirect to https://. In iOS this a httpclient connection to this URL will redirect on Android it will throw and error.

This is not consistent..

   Hello! Would you be able to provide a code snippet that reproduces the issue?</li>

   I can see that if I make a 'GET' then autoredirect does work in Android as it does in iOS. If I make a 'POST' then it doesn't redirect. 
   
   Apparently this can be dangerous if you auto-direct based on a POST, so I am ok to close.</li>
