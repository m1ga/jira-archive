<h3>Description</h3>

Hello,

Not sure if this is a bug or not, but I am having a very hard time finding an answer on this, and I can't profile my app so for me it's pretty important.

I am trying to run Xcode Allocations on my app on my device, and I'm receiving the error message in the attached image.

I followed the instructions for running Instruments here

<a href="https://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#</a>!/guide/Managing_Memory_and_Finding_Leaks-section-src-29004941_ManagingMemoryandFindingLeaks-MonitoringallocationsoniOS

I can't find any information on this error message, or anyone that has had this issue.  My app is correctly signed and the certs and profiles are up to date.

To reproduce, I simply run Allocations and hit record on my app.

If I try to record a running app on my device with live view on, the app crashes.

If I build a non-live view version I just get the error message in Allocations. 

My build script that is generated when I run my build script via bash

 /Users/xxxxx/.nvm/versions/node/v4.2.2/bin/node /Users/xxxxx/.appcelerator/install/6.2.0/package/node_modules/titanium/lib/titanium.js build -b -p ios -T dist-adhoc -R DISTCERT --sdk 6.0.4.GA -V DEVCERT -P b5a97126-705a-4bb5-8d12-ef8301be5e8d -O /Users/xxxxx/Documents/Appcelerator_Studio_Workspace/PROJECTNAME/dist --config-file /var/folders/ql/wkc3wf7s0cgbkl3hnct6sdcr0000gp/T/build-1498239722781.json --log-level info --no-banner --project-dir /Users/xxxxx/Documents/Appcelerator_Studio_Workspace/PROJECTNAME

Please advise.

Thanks

   N.B. If I build a non-live view version I just get the out comes in Allocations.
   
   Thanks</li>

   Hi,
   
   Can you try with a device?
   
   Thanks

   I can confirm it works for me on a simulator.  However we have some things in the app such as the camera, which does not work in the simulator, so I'd prefer if I could perform tests on a device so that I can get through a full use case.
   
   Thanks</li>

   Hello [~eric.harms@gmail.com], We can't reproduce it on simulator and device. Can you tell us what device are you using? </li>
