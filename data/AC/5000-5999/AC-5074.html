   Hello, Login through terminal, Run "appc logout -D" and "appc login". Follow through the process. After it's done, Open studio, should be loading fine without issue. Thanks. </li>

   Hello Sharif,
   
   Thank you for your comment.
   I am not working with the command line.
   The same thing happens back home when I close Appc Studio on my macbook and login on my iMac.
   I have to enter my login times 4 or 5 times now.
   
   Next it hangs with info in status bar "Opening Studio Dashboard..."
   Have to Forced Close Appc Studio.
   Open Appc Studio again, and finally can get back to work
   
   
   This used to work fine over the last years!

   You don't need to work with command line. Just run those command in terminal and the issue will be resolved. Studio communicate with CLI and that is why you need to sign up with command line. Thanks.</li>

   So when I use the CLI commands once, switching between iMac and Macbook will behave normally?

   Hello, You have to login to both device with the terminal. But you can't use two device at a same time with your account. Generally, when you login through terminal in a PC, your login is remain for 7 days registered with the device in Appcelerator login server. So, if you wont to switch to another device, make sure you "appc logout -D" to the first device and "appc login" to the second device. Thanks. </li>

   Hello Sharif, goodmorning!
   
   Sorry, I do not work with the terminal. Come on this is 2017!
   Logging in and out because I can only run Appcelerator Studio on one machine at a time with my account is okay. Appc Studio supported that always but now I have to login 4 sometimes 5 times!
   
   So please fix that :)
   
   Best regards,
   Raymond</li>

   And it's even worse, I have to enter an authentication code every time I login!!
   Disaster.</li>
