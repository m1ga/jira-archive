<h3>Description</h3>

Hi @Appcelerator Team,

 I'm getting the below *socket hang up* error when i try to package the application for store submission with the following environments. Let me know if you need further informations


PS: I can build the app into Simulator with the same environment with out any issue, Only the problem while packaging iOS Adhoc/enterprise build. 
I know that 3.5.1 GA is old, But we want to upload one major release with this SDK for avoid the store app issue,

   Hello, whats your CLI version? SDK 3.5.1.GA is too old. Can you try logout and login back through terminal?</li>

   This error indicates an Apple submission error. Please try again in a few hours or contact Apple to fix their endpoints. </li>

   Hi @Sharif AbuDarda 
   
   CLI version is 5.0.9 ,I ve updated all the environment details while post the ticket. And yes I have tried login and logout from Terminal many times, Also yes i know its old Ti SDK, But we need to submit the build with that SDK for fix issue with existing store app, Please do help us
   
   @Hans Knöchel I've tried many times, It seems to be that issue with appcelerator socket connection is hangup
   </li>
