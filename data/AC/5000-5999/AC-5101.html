<h3>Description</h3>

Hi guys,
I successfully implemented Android's push notifications with ACS and Firebase. When I build my app as development, everything works fine, I subscribe successfully to channel. But when I switch to production and install the app manually(without release to Play Store, for final test), app keeps showing error: Failed to register for push! Failed receiving GCM senderId. Max retry tine reaches. 
I don't understand why this error shows up, I have all set up properly, I tried to create/delete app in Firebase/Google console, but nothing helped. 
Please  help me.
Thank you

   Hello, Did you successfully configured the Key and senderID in production mode of your ArrowDB app? Make sure you set for both development type in the AprrowDB app. If development is working fine the production should be working too. I have tested a demo app and it's working. Can you make sure. Thanks.</li>

   Hi Sharif,
   I created new mobile project, copied over old source codes, set up push notifications on androdi for testing and production and it's working fine. I don't know what's wrong with the original project, but it's working fine now. Please close the issue as resolved. Thank you</li>
