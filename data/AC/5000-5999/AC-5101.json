		"description": "Hi guys,\r\nI successfully implemented Android's push notifications with ACS and Firebase. When I build my app as development, everything works fine, I subscribe successfully to channel. But when I switch to production and install the app manually(without release to Play Store, for final test), app keeps showing error: Failed to register for push! Failed receiving GCM senderId. Max retry tine reaches. \r\nI don't understand why this error shows up, I have all set up properly, I tried to create/delete app in Firebase/Google console, but nothing helped. \r\nPlease  help me.\r\nThank you",
