   Hi John, seems to be a specific file within our platform that is causing this issue. Commenting out the code from the problematic file allows the build to continue.
   
   I will try and narrow down the source of this issue and maybe provide more details around it.</li>

   Hi Luke, please keep the ticket updated with any further findings so we can continue to help.</li>

   Managed to track down the issue, which seems to be using the <code>OS_IOS</code> constant as a key/value name within a payload. 
   
   Strange that this hasn't appeared before, as the area of code this affected hasn't changed for a couple years.
   
   The build is now progressing past this point, so this ticket can be marked as resolved.</li>

   Call closed at customer request.</li>

   This is related to our use of babel and re-doing our alloy transforms to work with that. We may be more aggressively replacing OS_* constants than we used to in Alloy, resulting in a transforming your JS object to use true/false as the property key instead of OS_IOS.</li>

   OS_IOS constant key/value name within payload. Customer reports removing this and all is ok.</li>

   Thanks for a bit more information around this @Christopher Williams
   
   This will something to consider during future development.</li>
