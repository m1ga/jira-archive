<h3>Description</h3>

I've set up a new mac and tried to compile for an Android Emulator created in android studio. It wouldn't allow me to start the emulator or install an app on it.

The name of the Emulator was the default one (Nexus 5X API 23) and it always fails.

Studio creates the name with underscores (Nexus_5X_API_23) and displays it without underscores. 

When compiling from CLI I provide the name with underscores and all works at first go. In studio the name is provided without underscores and then will fail to compile for it as it cannot find the simulator.

   Hello, We recommend using default emulator created with Android SDK or using Genymotion emulator <a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#</a>!/guide/Installing_Genymotion. Please use emulator created by either one of them. Which supports with Appcelerator. Emulator created with Android studio might not work, and we don't recommend it. Thanks.</li>
