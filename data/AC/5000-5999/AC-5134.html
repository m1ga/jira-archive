<h3>Description</h3>

I've installed <code>npm install appcelerator -g</code>, ran the setup and installed the JDK. The default Alloy project will not run with Hyperloop active as a module. <code>spawn javac ENOENT</code> error.

Debug log: <a href="https://pastebin.com/EdRUsM0n" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://pastebin.com/EdRUsM0n</a>

I've checked different combinations including the "correct" JDK version (32bit on a 64 bit machine), correct Node version (4.x as stated by some sources from Google, probably very outdated?).

I'm trying to use the platform without the Studio because I think the whole IDE integration is sub-par and shows too much magic behind the scenes.

   [~uzbbert] Are you able to run <code>javac</code> from command prompt? If not make sure that the JDK location is in your path and you've restarted command prompt so those changes take</li>

   [~uzbbert] Thanks for the update, I'll investigate why our current checks didn't catch this and then possibly rework this ticket</li>

   Hello, looks to be node js issue. Try updating nodejs. </li>
