<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Steps to Reproduce</h4>
1. Install Studio 4.9.1.201707200100 and mobiel sdk 6.1.2.GA
2. Build a project for android (not sure this is really required)  The build will take place.
3. Install mobile sdk 5.5.1.GA
4. Try to build a project with 5.5.1.GA


<h4>Actual Result</h4>
[ERROR] :  No Android SDK targets found.
[ERROR] :  Please download an Android SDK target API level 23 or newer from the Android SDK Manager and try again.

If you uninstall 6.1.2 at this point, your Android environment is messed up.  If you look at the Android platform setup in preferences, it will say that no Android SDKs were found, though they are there.  Put 6.1.2 back in, and Android is OK again, but trying to BUILD with 5.5.1 can't find the SDKs.


<h4>Expected Result</h4>
It should build with either 5.5.1 or 6.1.2

   Hello, I wasn't able to reproduce the issue after installing SDK 6.1.2.GA. I can still build for 5.5.1.GA. And also my Android SDK location is fine in studio. Possibly you are missing some API's in Android SDK manager or your Titanium SDK 6.1.2.GA installation was faulty. Please try reinstalling SDK. and Updating Android SDK. Thanks.</li>

   Is there a process behind uninstalling a mobile sdk, or is it just a matter of removing it's directory?  I've been just removing the 6.1.2 directory.</li>

   I've uninstalled Studio and the mobile sdks.  Reinstalled Studio which included 6.1.2.GA.  During installation it correctly identified the Android SDK setups, and I can build in Android.  If I then install 5.5.1.GA and try to use it to build an Android app, I get the Error about no target SDKs found.  Studio at this point still sees the Android SDKs.  If I delete 6.1.2.GA, and all I have at that point is 5.5.1.GA, then Studio cannot find any of the Android SDKs, which are definitely installed.
   
   So, what about the mobile sdk's change the behavior of Android SDK Home?  Are there dependencies involved here that are coming into play?  Node or Java?
   
   I'm going to find a way to attach a diagnostic report from Studio.

   Hello, So I see the issue is not with SDK 6.1.2.GA. As you said with only that SDK you are able to build on Android. Can you update your Android SDK? Try downloading the API 21,22,23,24 and build tools. in Android SDK manager. Maybe SDK 5.5.1.GA is looking for supporting API's in Android SDK and not finding one. Thanks.</li>
<li>Phil Sweeney 2017-08-17

   Hello!  I've installed Build Tools and SDKs for 21,22,23, and 24.  Without SDK 6.1.2.GA installed, Studio says there are no Android SDKs under the specified SDK Location.  If I install 6.1.2.GA, Studio finds the Android SDKs - as long as I build with 6.1.2.GA. </li>

   Hello, Try building with latest SDK 6.2.2.GA. Thanks.</li>
<li>Sharif AbuDarda 2017-10-15

   Hello, Whats the update on building in 6.2.2.GA?</li>
<li>Phil Sweeney 2017-10-15

   We have migrated to 6.2.2 - But you don't seem to understand the issue.  The system will not build in 5.5.1 after you have installed 6.1.x or higher.  This forced us to migrate.  At this point, I don't care about the bug any longer. </li>
<li>Sharif AbuDarda 2017-10-31

   Hello, I can build for Android in SDK 5.5.1.GA, and I have already installed 6.2.2.GA in my system. The app runs fine with SDK 5.5.1.GA. Thanks.</li>
