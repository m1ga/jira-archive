<h3>Description</h3>

Chasing down memory leaks. It seems that opening a window and closing it will not release neither the WindowProxy or all of it's children proxies. I stripped everything down to basics to make sure it wasn't a widget or anything else I was doing. 

I attached the View, StyleSheet, Controller of the window. It get's opened by another window button via:  Alloy.createController("contactsList").getView().open(); 
so no reference left there. 

It's not a big issues for this particular window but it seems that it happens with every window so proxies add up quickly and eventually out of memory. Especially on Android. Is it possible that all children proxies won't release because the windowproxy is not released?

While testing the windowproxy gets released the first time it's opened after about 20s in instruments, all subsequent times it won't get released.
