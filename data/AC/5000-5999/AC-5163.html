<h3>Description</h3>

When attempting to start a debugging build in the Studio the application hangs on both iOS and Android.
 
iOS behavior: Hangs specifically during the "The debugger is waiting for you to launch the "<appname>" app on your device". Doesn't respond even when the app is launched. I can see console output from the phone but nothing from the debug view in Studio.

Android behavior: Gets to the point where the debugger dialog window disappears and is supposed to start the app automatically, but it never does and the app can't even be launched manually. It just hangs at the splash screen. Can see in the progress tab that the main process "Initializing debugger" is running and some other process keeps restarting over and over.
