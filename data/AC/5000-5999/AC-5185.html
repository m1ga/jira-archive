   Tried again on my main development computer, a Mac Mini, to run a build. It said it failed and was unable to install with no extra info. Checked the log and nothing was recorded for the incident.
   
   Checked back to the console and copied the adb command that it was trying to run in terminal and adb told me it was unable to install the app because of a version mismatch. This was because I had the current store version downloaded. After uninstalling the store version, the app was able to be built and installed fine.</li>
