<h3>Description</h3>

I feel like all of this started with me downloading and trying 6.2.0.RC - before that things were fast and smooth - now everything is slow. 

Android Build using the latest 6.2.0.GA to Simulator never completes, 6.1.2.GA works just fine. 6.2.0.GA can build to Android devices, it is just a lot slower (6m 28s 24ms) than 6.1.2GA but it does eventually build (4m 24s 73ms) As I said before - before trying 6.2.0.RC and now 6.2.0.GA things were fast and smooth. Now its all slow and the simulator builds never complete, it simply hangs at [INFO] :   Running dexer:

When I remove all modules in my app it does eventually build but takes about 10minutes to complete.

I have tried to remove and reinstall all Android SKDs.
I have tried Genymotion and Built in Android Emulators.

As I said once I switch to builing to a device it works fine, also switching back to building via 6.1.2.GA works fine.

I have also noticed that the Launching delegate... Progress status never appears when building to Emulators. Attached a working one for reference

Here is a complete trace log attached

   Ok so I have been able to get it to build on my Genymotion emulator by setting, it is still much slower than before but throwing ram at it has seemed to help. By the way, this is a very large app with many native modules etc
   
   <code><pre>
   &lt;property name="android.javac.maxmemory" type="string"&gt;2048M&lt;/property&gt;
   &lt;property name="android.dx.maxmemory" type="string"&gt;4096M&lt;/property&gt;
   </pre></code>
   
   Question: why are setting these properties in this way not documented anywhere? </li>

   Hello, We can't reproduce the issue. Is your issue resolved? </li>

   Building is still so slow that it never finished until I add the strings above, then it does complete, its still pretty slow but at least it works. This happened again with a different app, so it actually happens on my computer with two different apps - not sure what other info I can provide</li>

   Hello, the issue might be with your memory. Can you try building a new demo app? See if this build first or not. Thanks. </li>
