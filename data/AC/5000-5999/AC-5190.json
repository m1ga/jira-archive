Now its all slow and the simulator builds never complete, it simply hangs at [INFO] :   Running dexer:\r\n\r\nWhen I remove all modules in my app it does eventually build but takes about 10minutes to complete.\r\n\r\nI have tried to remove and reinstall all Android SKDs.\r\nI have tried Genymotion and Built in Android Emulators.\r\n\r\nAs I said once I switch to builing to a device it works fine, also switching back to building via 6.1.2.GA works fine.\r\n\r\nI have also noticed that the Launching delegate... Progress status never appears when building to Emulators. Attached a working one for reference\r\n\r\nHere is a complete trace log attached",
