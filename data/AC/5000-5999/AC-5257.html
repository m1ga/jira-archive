<h3>Description</h3>

After upgrading to Titanium SDK 6.2.2.GA we faced an issue with all listviews in our app, for which setting ListView height and width to Ti.UI.SIZE stopped working in Android and the listView fills the screen.

On Titanium SDK 6.1.2.GA we didn't face this issue, and its not affected on iOS, its only replicated on android devices.

Your action on this please, cause it affects all the design of pop's in our app.

It should be like  !Screen Shot 2017-10-04 at 3.02.47 PM.png|thumbnail!  but its showing like that on android 

Thanks

   Is this issue definitely resolved in 6.3.0? If so, I don't think the fix is working for all use-cases. I'm still experiencing the exact issue described in this ticket.</li>
<li>Yordan Banev 2017-11-30

   [~dfoxinator] Would you be able to provide a sample app that has the issue?</li>
