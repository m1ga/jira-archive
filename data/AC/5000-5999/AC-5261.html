<h3>Description</h3>

After getting Axway Appcelerator Studio 4.1.0.GA installed on one machine, I noticed that it did not install an updated (1.2.1) Titanium hook for LiveView.   

How do I get this installed??   Why can this not just be an npm package that is installed and configures the Titanium hooks?   It seems like a VERY painful process to go through to get LiveView.

Please help!!

   [~brentonhouse] For the path to update I believe you'll need to build an app from Studio once with LiveView enabled,</li>

   No-Go.
   
   I tried running a project in Studio using liveview and yes, it does install the hook, but it is still pointed to old LiveView:  /Applications/Appcelerator Studio/plugins/com.appcelerator.titanium.liveview.core_1.1.0.1504770756/node_modules/liveview/hook
   
   This is very weird considering this is a new machine and it is the first time installing Studio on it.   Did Studio not ship with an updated version of LiveView?</li>

   [~brentonhouse] I just ran a new build with liveview enabled and it was able to run using liveview 1.2.1 !Screen Shot 2017-10-09 at 1.23.05 PM.png|thumbnail! </li>

   So the internal version number was incremented of the version of LiveView plugin itself was not?</li>

   [~brentonhouse]Looks like the fix came through studio in 4.10.0 not updating the plug in but through studio itself.</li>
