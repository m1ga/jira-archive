<h3>Description</h3>

Here is the step to duplicate

1. create listview with dummy data
2. each item add 1 imageview with load remote image
3. remote image is a large image, for example 5000x5000 with size 1mb
4. listview is hardly scrolled (laggy)

Try above case, change the remote image url to broken link (for example "<a href="http://brokenlink.com/image.png" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://brokenlink.com/image.png</a>")
then try to scroll the item, it very laggy.

I'm not sure it affecting what kind of TI SDK version, but for sure in 5.5.1/6.1.2 GA it was working fine.

   Hello [~dyan02],
   
   Thanks for sharing with us.  Can you please try to use a smaller size image on list view? Using high resolution image on list view will consume more memory which is expected behavior. It is imperative that you don't load lots of images into memory at once or you'll exhaust your app's memory.

   Thanks</li>

   Well it was working fine in 6.1.2 although it's a huge image resolution.
   
   But it's not the only problem, try to load a listview in 6.2.2, set defaultImage to imageview, and set broken url image to imageview.image parameter, the listing will be laggy to scroll.</li>
