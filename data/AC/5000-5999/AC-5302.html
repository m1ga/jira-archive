<h3>Description</h3>

I can not run on emulator or compile applications for Windows Phone after updating Windows 10 and Visual Studio 2017.
I attach a log.txt file with console output and two files ("CMakeError.log"
"CMakeOutput.log") created in the attempt to compile.

Windows 10 is upgraded with the latest updates, Visual Studio 2017 just installed and Appcelerator Studio reinstalled with latest version available.

I tried using 6.2.2.GA and 6.3.0.RC versions, and a 7.0.0 alpha, but the result is the same.

   dont put any effort anymore into Windows Phone. Its a dead platform, and basically not worth your time and appcelerators'</li>

   It would be better for everyone, the problem is that my company has signed an SLA contract with a customer dating more than a year ago, which is the owner of the distributed application for the 3 OSs, including windows phone. At least for the moment I need to keep the application updated with the latest SDKs.</li>

   [~sandrolain] I believe this might be down to not having all the correct components installed, we're in the process of finalising documentation, could you check you have everything noted in the below installed
   
   1 Download the Visual Studio installer from <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/</a>
   2 Run the installer and select the Visual Studio Edition you wish to install
   3 Select the following required Workloads and optional workload components
       * Universal Windows Platform Development with the C++ Universal Windows Platform Tools optional component
   4 Select the following required Individual Components, note that the versions may differ from what is listed below as new versions are released
      * SDKs, Libraries, and frameworks
      ** Windows 10 SDK (10.15063.0) for Desktop C++ x86 and x64
      ** Windows 10 SDK (10.0.15063.0) for UWP: C++
   
   5 If you wish to use emulators during development, select the Windows Mobile Emulators component in the Universal Windows Platform development optional packages
   6 Click 'Install'
   7 Once the install has finished, open Visual Studio to verify that the install worked

   Thanks
   There was no installation of *Windows 10 SDK (10.15063.0) for Desktop C ++ x86 and x64* in the default installation.
   The default option selected was *10.16299.0*</li>

   [~sandrolain] Great, does everything look good then? Are you able to build successfully? </li>
<li>Sandro Lain 2017-10-24

   Yes, I just tried running on Emulator and running Local Machine and now it works properly.
   Packaging also seems to be successful. I still have to try installing the builds on a real device.</li>
<li>Sharif AbuDarda 2017-10-28

   Hello [~sandrolain], Let us know if the issue is still there for the device build?  </li>
<li>Sandro Lain 2017-10-30

   Yes, I've run realtime field tests today and the application is compiled, installed and executed correctly. The latest version of SDK seems much better than the beginning of the year.</li>
