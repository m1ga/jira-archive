   Hello, I can't reproduce the issue in iOS simulator 11.0, I define your function in alloy.js and call the function in index.xml in a button click event. The event fires fine for simulator build. Can you share a full code for this? </li>

   Can you please test the sample code from [here](<a href="https://gist.github.com/rakhimoni/e15cc150f82dbf0d5d5ff7ddd31b40a8)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://gist.github.com/rakhimoni/e15cc150f82dbf0d5d5ff7ddd31b40a8)</a> on your end and let us know how it goes.

   Hi @Mostafizur, I tested your code and is working as well. Also my sample code that I tested before to open this issue now is working maybe due to the CLI that was outdated. Really don't know but is working. 
   
   You can close this issue, thanks!</li>
