<h3>Description</h3>

I'm working on a iOS and Android DVR app with remote controls.
I need to use a third-party library for network communication and video encoding, via hyperloop programming.

At the moment I tried importing the iOS version libraries.
The library consists of a static file libDVR_NET_SDK.a and a "include" folder with several .h header files inside.

I followed the official documentation ad copy the files into folder /app/platform/ios without creating the appc.js file (documentation report that is deprecated).

I can not understand how to call the external library from javascript code, at the moment I tried:

    var libDVR_NET_SDK = require("libDVR_NET_SDK");

But the following error is generated with simulator:

    [ERROR] :  Script Error Couldn't find module: libDVR_NET_SDK for architecture: x86_64

Or on device:

    [ERROR] :  Script Error Couldn't find module: libDVR_NET_SDK for architecture: arm64

   Hello [~sandrolain],
   Thanks for sharing with us. Check [Modules inTitanium ](<a href="https://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#</a>!/guide/CommonJS_Modules_in_Titanium).  Please make sure the module is  included in the tiapp.xml  and to be rebuilt with 64-bit support. Please follow the steps, test in latest SDK and let us know how it goes.

   Hello
   What I'm trying to import is not a titanium module but a pre-compiled native library given by our vendor hrough hyperloop.</li>

   You need to require the actual headers, not the static library itself. Also, it looks like a C++ library, which types are not fully supported in Hyperloop, yet. In that case, you may want to wrap the API's using a native module (create a new one with <code>appc ti create -t module</code>).</li>

   [~sandrolain], Did you manage to follow [~hknoechel] 's instructions?</li>

   I'm trying to create a module that incorporates the code and native libraries I have been provided, but I do not have much experience with creating native modules.</li>

   Hello, you need to build a module to support your C++ library with Appcelerator. Currently, hyperloop does not fully support that. There is a guide on how to get started with Android module in Appcelerator, <a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#</a>!/guide/Android_Module_Project. Thanks. </li>
