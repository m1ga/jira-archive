<h3>Description</h3>

TextField on iOS 11 has an odd bar over the keyboard. Is there a parameter in TextField iOS SDK that has not been exposed for iOS 11?

To Reproduce:
- Create a View with 2 Text Fields. 
- One of them displayed as a Password.
- Run

After typing One character in the TF, it disappears, this happens on TextFields that are Not Passwords as well. 

The Key Icon, I assume is for Saved Passwords, though even it shows on TextFields with regular visible text.

   It's a behavior used for username / password fields and seems to be a known problem for devs, see [here](<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45452170/ios-11-disable-password-autofill-accessory-view-option)." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45452170/ios-11-disable-password-autofill-accessory-view-option).</a> Not sure what's the best thing to address this, but it doesn't really look like a Titanium issue. Applying the workaround provided in Stackoverflow (again, this is not specific to Titanium), you can set the "autofillType" property of the text-field to an empty string, e.g
   <code><pre>
   field.autofillType = '';
   </pre></code></li>
