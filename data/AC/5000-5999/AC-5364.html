<h3>Description</h3>

We're trying to use the Nordic Semiconductor iOSDFULibrary Pod with the Hyperloop-examples test program with Hyperloop 2.2.2.  We've just inserted the following statement in the "beacons.js" file:
	
iOSDFULibrary = require("iOSDFULibrary/iOSDFULibrary"),

which causes the error when you click on the iBeacons menu item.

{color:red}[ERROR] :  Script Error Couldn't find module: /hyperloop/iosdfulibrary/iosdfulibrary for architecture: x86_64{color}

The Podfile is

<code><pre>
install! 'cocoapods',
         :integrate_targets => false

platform :ios, '8.0'
use_frameworks!

target 'Hyperloop_Sample' do
	pod 'JBChartView'
	pod 'GLCalendarView', '~> 1.2'
	pod 'Shimmer'
    pod 'iOSDFULibrary'
    pod 'Zip'
end

post_install do |installer|
    installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
        target.build_configurations.each do |config|
            config.build_settings['SWIFT_VERSION'] = '4.0'
        end
    end
  end
</pre></code>

The last few lines of the log seem to indicate that the module is available but it isn't found nonetheless

   It appears that the Hyperloop Pod mechanism is fragile. I decided to try the Contentful Swift Pod and added the require('Contentful/Contentful') to the Hyperloop-examples app and  I got the same error as with iOSDFULibrary:
   
   [ERROR] :  Script Error Couldn't find module: /hyperloop/contentful/contentful for architecture: x86_64
   
   I guess the question is how restrictive the environment is for using Pods?  Both of these Pods are Swift pods which are supposed to be supported.  Was there another regression with 2.2.2?

   Pure Swift framework (without the public Objective-C header) are not supported so far. They require a different way of parsing and are tracked in TIMOB-24163. This is not a regression.</li>
