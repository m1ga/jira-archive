		"description": "Hey!\r\n\r\nI ran into an issue when using Analytics pod version higher than 3.3.0. Starting from 3.4.0 it does not build and gives an CompileC error when trying to build.\r\n\r\nXcode version: 9.1\r\nTitanium SDK: 6.3.0.GA\r\n\r\nMy Podfile looks like this:\r\n\r\n{code:java}\r\n# This is required for CocoaPods 1.x\r\ninstall!

That is what hyperloop is doing? Taking a library and compiling it. But in this case it fails to do it. Meaning there is some piece of code what hyperloop is not able to compile meaning there is a bug somewhere.\r\n\r\nMy last issue was ignored for way too long with the bug still being there. That is why i created a new one to draw attention to it again.\r\n\r\nPlease take the 5 minutes and try to run this code and see that the compiling fails.\r\n",
