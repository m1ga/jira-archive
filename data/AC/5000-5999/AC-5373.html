<h3>Description</h3>

Hello everyone,

In some devices we have noticed a bug when there is TextArea on a TableView. When the keyboard is open and you are ready to write, it take you back on top of the TableView.
We have noticed that issue on XIAOMI and Huawei devices, however, there are some android devices that work properly.

Have you noticed that issue as well?

Thank you in advance!

   Hello, It would be helpful if you provide a demo code for us to test the issue in our environment. Also, some more details like the SDK, CLI and Android versions to test the issue. Thanks.</li>

   Im using appcelrator CLI 6.3.0 and titanium SDK 6.3.0 and android 6.0.
   The issue also appears in the older versions of the SDK.
   I believe there is something to do with the manufacturer and not the android version. In some devices the issue appears whereas in others does not.
   
   Thank you.</li>

   The first keyboard (Gboard) works properly, the second one (swiftkey) doesn't work. That is the issue i believe.
   This issue does not happen when i use both keyboards in other third party apps. !23659795_913322168819511_161495483_o.jpg|thumbnail! </li>

   Hello, I am testing on Android 7.1.2 (Nokia 6) device. I am not seeing the behavior you have mentioned. An opening keyboard does resize the display. But never go back to the top. Thanks.</li>

   Hello [~andreas.pingas],  I just wanted to follow up here.  Did you check in latest android devices(7/8) using SDK 6.3.0.GA? Let us know if you still experience any issue. We would be happy to assist you.
   Best Regards!</li>
