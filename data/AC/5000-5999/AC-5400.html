<h3>Description</h3>

Publish app on google store doesen't allow showDatePickerDialog on android with this error 
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'showDatePickerDialog' of undefined.

Bug appears only after publish, it works correctly if install app from titanium.

i changed var picker = Ti.UI.createPicker(); to var pickerdata = Ti.UI.createPicker({
type: Ti.UI.PICKER_TYPE_DATE,
value:new Date()    
}); and now it works on google.

   Hello, There seems to be a lot of information missing in your report. First, we need a full sample code. Also, the SDK you are using to build? Need the target Android API version when publishing. Also, if you are using old SDK I would suggest you upgrade to latest SDK 6.3.0.GA and try again. Try also upgrade your studio to 4.10.x version. Thanks.</li>

   I was using last sdk (6.3.0) and last version of titanium. I tried with api23/api24. Here a full sample code:
