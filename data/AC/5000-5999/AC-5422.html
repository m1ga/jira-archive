<h3>Description</h3>

Hello,

We are having a module built for our application, and after adding the module and running the app for Android, we are receiving the following error.

The files are not in the same directory, Im confused at how this can be seen as a duplicate file?  Is there any way to force delete duplicates or ignore them?

Thanks,
Eric

   Hello, Please provide a sample app for us to test the issue, also provide a guide on how to test the issue for successful regeneration. I would suggest upgrading your SDK and CLI to the latest one. Thanks.</li>

   Hi Sharif, 
   
   Just for the record, if anyone comes across this issue.
   
   We "resolved" this issue by removing ti.map/<latest version>/platform/android/res, and removing the google play base and basement .jars from any other modules.  
   
   Hopefully 7.0.0 and the new way play services is being handled will improve on this issue.
   
   Thanks
   Eric
