<h3>Description</h3>

I have 2 xcodes installed, 1 called <code>xcode.app</code> (xcode9) and one called xcode8.app.

xcode8.app has been selected as default xcode through CLI (xcode-select), and I just updated xcode9, then compile for iOS 10.3 simulator fails because EULA needs to be accepted.

   Can't trigger it again as I'd already opened it. its the regular EULA warning</li>

   Can you check if the Xcode8 is selected in the preference of the studio? Since you have updated the Xcode9, It might be changed. Usually, higher version of Xcode is selected by default. So, that might be the case here. </li>

   I used xcode select on CLI to change it to 8 after 9 was installed. 
   
   iOS SDK home is: /Applications/Xcode8.app/
   
   So the correct one. Default Device Profile is iPhone 6s (v10.3.1)
   
   I'm using TiSDK 6.0.4 in case thats also relevant. Studio is 4.10.0.201709271713</li>

   Thanks for your feedback. Can you please rename the xcode 8 as iOS SDK home :/Applications/Xcode.app/ and test again. If need refresh the studio. Please let us know if you get the issue again.

   Having custom Xcode names is not supported by Apple, they specifically have a note for that in their release notes. This is nothing we can influence.</li>

   Thanks! Guess I'll have to deal with it then :)</li>

   As a simple workaround, you can simply move the other installation outside /Applications and re-move it again when being required again. I'm thinking of a 5-liner shell-script that does some <code>mv</code> and <code>xcode-select</code> :-).</li>
