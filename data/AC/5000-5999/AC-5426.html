   Hello [~ray@raymondverbruggen.nl],
   Thanks for sharing with us. Which studio version are you using? Are you able to login via studio? It would be great if you can attach a screenshot which displays the issue properly.

   Hello Mostafizur!
   
   I am using the latest version of studio. I am not able to login via Studio and also not via CLI.
   A screen !Schermafbeelding 2017-12-06 om 13.04.00.png|thumbnail!  
   
   This is urgent, I am waiting already for a long time! This is blocking everything!

   Still looking at a spinning wheel cursor.
   How can I declare the non-productive hours?
   This day is lost, my customer is furious!</li>

   Hello, We are having some technical issue. I can see the same error when opening dashboard in the studio. We are actively working on it. Should be fixed soon. Thanks.</li>
<li>Sharif AbuDarda 2017-12-07

   Hello, The issue is fixed. Can you please check and get back to us?</li>
<li>Raymond Verbruggen 2017-12-07

   Hello!
   
   I understand that it struck you and you where not amused having technical issues (understatement).
   Sorry for that.
   
   My problem is that I was at a customer's site (abroad) for one day only to make an update for his app, and I could not do anything. That is not acceptable, this cost me real bucks!
   
   No message that explained what was happening.
   No announcement that some server would be going offline.
   No message that some server had (accidentally) gone offline.
   ... etc
   Only a spinning wheel.
   Because of the lack of information I kept trying and trying thinking it was a short hick-up.
   
   Even calling the support telephone number did not help, a french speaking woman (I pressed the "support in English" button) kept asking for some number and wanted to make a ticket. She should have known that there was something wrong.
   I wonder, was I the only person having difficulties? There must have been more.
   
   
   Okay, I can imagine it is a requirement to be logged in on the specific machine.
   But after that, working offline must be possible at all times.
   
   
   I just checked, when I remove the internet connection I get the following message:
   [ERROR] :  You are offline but this is the first time you are building this application with this configuration. You must be online once with this build configuration and then you can do subsequent builds offline.
   
   What does this mean? Last week I built the application successfully.
   What does configuration mean? When does it change?
   
   Everybody can live with the necessity of having an internet connection once in a while but please make clear when it is needed.
   
   
   Best regards,
   Raymond</li>
