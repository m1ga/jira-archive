<h3>Description</h3>

Hi guys,
I recently update Java to Java 8 Update 151 and since then, Appc studio is extremely unstable and laggy. I double click to open a file, rainbow wheel shows up and it takes *minutes* for Studio to become responsive. And when it does, I do another simple action and rainbow wheel shows up again and I can make a coffee :)
Other applications runs normally, when I click dock icon to focus Studio, nothing happens(I right click and see Application not responding). I tried to force quit, I tried to restart my Mac(many times), nothing helped. Unfortunately I don't have Java pre-update backup in Timemachine, so I can't revert back easily.
Please advise me what to do, to make it normal responsive.
Thanks

   This is happening right after you updated JDK? I have the same JDK, which is running smoothly. Can you try to uninstall the whole thing and reinstall again. I mean CLI, SDK, And studio. Run the below commands one by one: 
   
   rm -rf ~/.appcelerator 
   rm -rf ~/.titanium 
   sudo npm uninstall -g titanium 
   sudo npm uninstall -g appcelerator 
   sudo npm install -g appcelerator 
   appc use latest 
   appc setup
   
   Use sudo in the first two if necessary. We have not got any similar report on this issue. Please get back to us. Thanks.</li>

   Hi Sharif,
   yes, I noticed it after I updated JDK. Also my friend(also from Slovakia) is experiencing exactly same problem, he can't load Dasboard, when he/I start the Studio, it's not responding after a while, I tried to check updates - error come out(Error occured during Axway Appcelerator update, please make sure the network is connected to receive updates). It showed me memory heap error earlier, so I incresed in in AppceleratorStudio.ini file, it worked for a while, but it's not working now...
   
   I downloaded Studio 5.0RC to try, I'll install it over current installation and if it will not work, I'll remove it and install latest GA from scratch.
   Thanks</li>

   So I don't have to reinstall/uninstall whole Studio and set it up again from scratch?</li>
