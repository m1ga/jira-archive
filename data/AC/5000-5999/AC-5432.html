<h3>Description</h3>

When canceling an OptionDialog on iPad it does not give back focus to the window therefore messing up navigation using the NavigationWindow. On iPhone canceling an OptionDialog will give back focus to the window and I have no issues. Blur and Focus events on the windows confirm this behavior.

   Hello, Please share a sample reproducible code for us to test. Thanks.</li>

   Although it may not be the answer you are looking for, we are not doing anything special for the option-dialog regarding <code>blur</code> and <code>focus</code> events. It looks like Apple decided to now fire the delegates (<code>viewWillAppear</code> and <code>viewWillDisappear</code>) for option-dialogs in popovers like on the iPad. One reason might be that they technically allow you to provide pass-through views that can be used even is the option dialog is shown. This is not available on the iPhone, so it's presented modally instead of the current context like on the iPad.
   
   For a solution and way cleaner alternative, listen to the "click" event of the dialog, which will also be triggered if the user taps outside the option-dialog.
