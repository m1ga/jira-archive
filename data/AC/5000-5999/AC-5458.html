<h3>Description</h3>

After I upgraded to the latest version 5.0, it can't recognize the iOS SDK, Android SDK is fine.
I had to rollback to studio 4.1.
BTW, the "Affectes Version" still doesn't have 5.0 as an option to pick

   Hello, Do you have multiple xcode installed on your system? Can you click the refresh button in the studio preference? You can try to run this command in CLI "sudo xcode-select -switch <xcode_folder_path>" provide the xcode folder path which usually /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/. Let us know. Thanks.</li>

   I only have one xcode installed. Yes I tried to run the command before I submitted the ticket. There's nothing wrong with my xcode, I can use studio 4.1 just fine. I can use atom with appcelerator plugin just fine. 
   Yes. I tried the refresh button, it didn't do anything. 
   If I click the configure, it opens my Mac app store.

   Hello [~jason919],
   Thanks for your feedback. Are you using latest CLI and SDK? You can try to run this command in CLI "*sudo xcode-select -switch <xcode_folder_path>*" provide the xcode folder path which usually /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/. Restart the studio for your changes to take effect. and open studio again. Let us know. Thanks.</li>

   Before I submitted first ticket, I have already tried the command. Same result, it can't identify iOS.
   
   $ sudo xcode-select -switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/
   Password:
   xcode-select: error: invalid developer directory '/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/'
   $ sudo xcode-select -switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/
   $ appc setup
   Finding latest version ...7.0.0 âœ“
   Version 7.0.0 already installed.
   ? Do you plan on developing Titanium apps? Yes
   
   Checking your environment...

   I tried the 5.0 GA build and nightly build, same result, can't identify iOS SDK.
   but my appcelerator atom plugin works fine and studio 4.1 works fine.</li>

   I uploaded the studio's log file 
   here is the exception in the log

   [~jason919],
   Thanks for your feedback. Run the following commands and let us know how it goes.
   
   * Close Appcelerator Studio
   * Open the terminal
   * Stop the daemon: *appc appcd stop*
   * cd into the appcelerator package: *cd ~/.appcelerator/install/7.0.0/package*
   * Install the update: *npm install ioslib@next*
   * Reopen Studio
   
   Hope this helps.
   
   Best</li>
<li>jason hu 2017-12-18

   it is working now.
   what does "npm install ioslib@next" do? </li>
<li>Sharif AbuDarda 2017-12-18

    Hello, Is the issue fixed for you?</li>
<li>jason hu 2017-12-18

    yes, it is fixed with those commands.
    can you please help me understand what went wrong initially ?</li>

    The above solution did not work for me. I was told to revert back to SDK 6.3.0 by running the command "appc use 6.3.0" but I was not able to download using the command. So Instead I did below.
    
    1. Even though appc use 6.3.0 command showed download as success, but the sdk was not actually downloaded in the Titanium mobile sdk folder.
    2. So I compressed the sdk from another mac and then send it to the macbook that had the issue.
    3. Then restarted studio - then 6.3.0 sdk was listed in tiapp.xml.
    4. Then I ran the command in terminal appc use 6.3.0
    5. Restarted the studio
    6. Now the ios and anroid SDKs are configured.
    
    I am still in the latest studio version
    Axway Appcelerator Studio, build: 5.0.0.201712081732</li>

    [~maheshnrk]
    
    Please try the following commands via the terminal/command prompt. 
    
    appc logout -D
    npm install -g appcelerator
    appc use latest
    appc config set proxyServer null
    appc setup
    appc login
    Open the terminal
    Stop the daemon: appc appcd stop
    cd into the appcelerator package: cd ~/.appcelerator/install/7.0.0/package
    Install the update: npm install ioslib@next
    Open Studio
    
    Hope this helps.
