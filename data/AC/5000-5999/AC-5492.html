<h3>Description</h3>

Title says it all: is it possible to make Titanium modules that are backwards-compatible with Titanium apps that are lower than 7.0.0GA?

For example, I have a Titanium module that is built with 6.1.0.GA. It does not run on 7.0.0.GA.
I would like to update it to 7.0.0.GA and still support any developers using it with old 6.1.0+ versions.

From what I gather here: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47939778/how-to-make-a-backwards-compatible-titanium-module." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47939778/how-to-make-a-backwards-compatible-titanium-module.</a> It is not possible to do such a module. Am I correct?

   Hello, As in the answer given by Rene Pot, However, "You can easily recompile the module again for lower versions. So, lower api version to 3 and set minsdk to 6.0.0, and you can use it in TiSDK 6.
   
   It not really is backward compatible, but just having 2 builds (and 2 versions) should be fine. You could even include them both in your app and just switch based on SDK you use."
   
   So, This is the workaround for you. Thanks.

   We've decided not to support Titanium SDKs lower than 7.0.0.GA anymore. Thank you very much, Mr. AbuDarba and Mr. Rahman. Feel free to close the issue.</li>
