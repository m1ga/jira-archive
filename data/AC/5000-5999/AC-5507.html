   Hi,
   
   Sample code is already attached.I have attached file again here as well.
   
   My problem is:
   1. I have a website published on local server. its IP address is like 10.228.172.113
   2. application virtual directory is "PDASync" 
   
   I am trying to access url :  [^testHTTPClient.js] 
   
   This is my local example.
   
   This url is accessible from IE browser present in windows 10 Surface pro. But not accessible from Appcelerator APP installed on this machine.
   
   I tried by passing network username, password and domain as well. I tried everything but it didn't work. Same piece of code is working in IOS and Android.
