   Hello [~boaz@e-drivetech.com],
   
   Sorry for the delay. Can you please create a new project, enable push services for that and do the following:
   Please go to the firebase link
   <a href="https://console.firebase.google.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://console.firebase.google.com/</a>
   Then create your project and use that Project ID and server Key as a GCM sender ID and GCM API key.

   *I'm really really disappointed from your  product and your support especially  Sharif who closed this issue without solving the problem.*
   Currently i did a downgrading to version 5.5 where imyellow push plugin works
   I didn't choose to work with your product, i got it as "gift" from our previous programmer.
   I basically prefer  native coding and now i'm sure more than ever   that no appcelerator or what ever product can replace native coding.

   Hello, Without the arrow cloud you will not be able to register the devices and configure push notification. This was the resolution there and also the answer to your question. Thanks.</li>
