<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Steps to Reproduce</h4>
Using the latest Axway studio, I'm trying to debug an application I haven't run for a few months. I know it's an old chestnut, and clearly something is referencing a deviceid that no longer exists!

Is there a cache I can flush or an easy way to remedy this?

   Hello, Your ticket does not have sufficient info. What is the platform you are trying to build on? Please do a hard restart on your PC and turn on again. Open terminal and run "appc ti setup check" and send the log in here. Try opening studio and try building to simulator by running the command "appc run -p ios" in studio terminal. Thanks.</li>

   Hi Abdul, it turned out that I had not updated the tiapp.xaml file inline with changes in the new 7.0SDK.
   
   Running the "appc run -p ios" was a great suggestion , as it gave me output in the console which enabled me to debug this. Running from the studio , i.e. pressing the play button did not produce any outut.....why would there be a difference? Anyway thank you very much for your time, and please close the ticket at your earliest convenience.
   
   regards
   
   Michael Warnes</li>
