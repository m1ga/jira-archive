<h3>Description</h3>

When my iPad app is built with version 7.0.1 of Titanium SDK and launched on older iPads (those with 32-bit processors, like the iPad Mini, iPad 2 and 3), the app crashes immediately after showing the start-up screen.

I rebuilt my iPad app with the version 6.3 SDK and updated it in the App Store, with no other changes, and it runs fine on those older 32-bit processor iPads.

Since these crashes were on customer iPads, and since I don't have anything old enough to cause this, I do not have crash logs or anything else.

   Hello, We need the crash log to figured out the actual reasons for the crash. Can u let us know what are the iOS versions on those affected iPads? Maybe there are limitations to supported iOS versions in SDKs.
   Thanks.</li>

   I don't have crash logs since this happened on customer iPads. I did look in XCode Oganizer and there were no crash logs for these. The crash happened immediately after showing launch image, so app never actually finishing launching. Version of iOS was 9.3.5 running on original iPad Mini, iPad 2, and an iPad 3. All running A6 or A6X chip.</li>

   We will not be able to work on this issue without a minimal test case. In case you can provide a basic reproducible test-case, we'll schedule it, thanks!</li>

   I am purchasing a refurbished iPad 2. Hopefully I can reproduce the crash and get those logs for you.</li>

   I installed my app, built with 7.0.1 on my refurbished iPad 2, running iOS 9.3.5, and it launched and ran. Very slowly, but it did run. No crashes. So I suspect this has more to do with the particular iPads than me or you. Go ahead and close this ticket. Thanks.</li>
