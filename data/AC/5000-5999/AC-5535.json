					"body": "The Google Play app listing UI is a custom view. There's nothing natively built-in to Android or iOS that will quite replicate it. Not even the native Android RecyclerView does quite the same thing.\r\n\r\nWhat I think you can do is set up a vertical ScrollView container which has child horizontal ScrollViews in it. Each child horizontal ScrollView should listen to the vertical ScrollView container's \"scroll\" event to detect if it is still onscreen or not. The \"scroll\" event provides property \"y\" to tell you how far down it has scrolled down and the child horizontal ScrollView's (x,y) coordinates will be relative to that event's \"y\" value. So, the idea is if you scroll far enough off-screen, then you should null out the ImageView's \"image\" property to unload the image and when the child view scrolls back on-screen, you should re-load the image into the ImageView. You're effectively implementing your own image culling.\r\n",

There could be alternatives like you have described here, but Titanium must provide native RecyclerView so any layout type can be designed keeping memory efficiency at best.\r\n\r\nWe would love to see it in SDK 8.x",
