<h3>Description</h3>

The provisioning has been correctly loaded through Xcode, it's present in ~/Library/MobileDevice/Provisioning Profiles, it's detected by CLI but Studio doesn't see it.

If I add it manually to Studio it will show up in the list. When I close and reopen it, the provisioning is not there anymore.

Something is messed up.

   Hello [~a.marcone], Thanks for sharing the log. I have tested this issue on my end and cannot reproduce the issue. 
   *Steps which I have followed:*
   1. Went to the Apple developer account and create a new app IDs
   2. Created a new development Provisioning Profiles and continue all
   3. Then open my Xcode and download the profiles manually from Xcode>>Preference>> using my developer account credentials
   4. Now open the studio then run configuration and got the newly created Provisioning Profiles.
   
   *Steps which you can follow:*
   1. Please update your node.js to 8.9.4
   2. Also, remove the profiles from your PC and download from the Xcode again
   3. Try to check on studio now.
   
   Thanks</li>

   after removing the provisioning present in ~/Library/MobileDevice/Provisioning Profiles , I can still see the profiles in Appc Studio. Where are they located?</li>
