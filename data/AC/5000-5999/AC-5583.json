I've found that:\r\n- When pressed the button that opens the selector it takes some time to load the selector, keeping the app freeze (from 1 to several seconds).\r\n- When the selector is loaded, scrolling through the options is really slow and selecting a country that is at the bottom of the list is simply annoying.\r\n\r\nThe same code works perfectly in Android.\r\n\r\nI've attached the app.js of the app for testing.",

I feel like this is the native iOS behavior, here is why:\r\n- Natively, a {{UIAlertAction}} is created for every option\r\n- The alert dialog and option dialog (same underlaying {{UIAlertController}} API) is not made to store a huge list of options\r\n- Apple recommends to use nested lists for those UX use-cases. For example, they use it as well when selecting a country in the settings\r\n\r\nIf you still feel it's only Titanium, which would be okay, we would prepare a native test to reproduce it. What do you think?",

In fact, I remember that in the past (can't recall when... but maybe 1 and a half years ago) this exact same thing was working perfectly in Titanium.\r\n\r\nBut yeah, could be that they have changed how things work and we need to move to other solutions.\r\n\r\nHaven't tested this native in iOS, but it would be great that it worked fast and smooth like in android.\r\n\r\nIf there isn't any other solution, I will move to use nested lists or search fields, instead.\r\n\r\nThanks",

I am sorry we cannot do more here as we are dependent on the native iOS side, but you might want to raise this as an iOS issue if it was faster on earlier versions - I'd be interested what they say. Let me know if you are okay with resolving the ticket, thank you anyway for raising this!",

I think the best way to test would be an old iPhone 4 (with iOS 9) if someone has still one.
