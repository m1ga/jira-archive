   Hello [~shumne], Thanks for sharing with us. Can you please update your environment and test again. It would be better if you can attach reproducible test code. Also, provide detail affected environment. Thanks.

   Hi Please find the test code below.
   
   var win = Titanium.UI.createWindow({
       title : 'Test',
       backgroundColor : '#fff',
       exitOnClose : true
   });
   
   var contentURL = "/www.exapmle.com/video.mp4";
   
   var activeMovie = Titanium.Media.createVideoPlayer({
       	height:"400dp",
       	width:Ti.UI.SIZE,
           url : contentURL,
           backgroundColor : 'blue',
           mediaControlStyle : Titanium.Media.VIDEO_CONTROL_DEFAULT,
           scalingMode : Titanium.Media.VIDEO_SCALING_ASPECT_FIT,
           // fullscreen : true,
           autoplay : true
       });
   win.add(activeMovie);
   win.open();
   
   Once you run the app the video will start at that time put the app in background for some second and launch it again.
   
   Affected Environment:
   Ti SDK 6.3.0.GA
   Appc Studio 4.10
   CLI 6.3.0
   Android Marshmello 6.0.1
   
   Please let me know if you need more details.

   It was expected to me that the video should start where I left it and not from the initial playback time.</li>

   Hello, Is this only happening for Android Marshmello 6.0? I tested the issue with Android 8.0 with SDK 7.0.1.GA, and I see the video resumes from last play time. But I see that it's takes 4-5 seconds to playback. Can you test on some higher Android version? Thanks.</li>
