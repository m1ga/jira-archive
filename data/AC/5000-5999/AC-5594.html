<h3>Description</h3>

Swiping left on the root window of a tab with a window navigatonwindow stack, causes app problems.

This looks to be a ios tab/navigationwindow wide problem. 
The below video has similar issues on other frameworks, with objective c related code.
We likely need to expose disabledbackgesture so we can put these on the root windows.

And yes, I do realise that the following is react-native, and this is Titanium, but the ios wide bug is the same.

<a href="https://github.com/wix/react-native-navigation/pull/872" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/wix/react-native-navigation/pull/872</a>

Please test.

My env. is 7.0.2.GA. iOS, with a tab that opens windows in a stack.e.g.
<code><pre>
		$.index.activeTab.open(_controller);
</pre></code>

   Please attach a Titanium related test-case and video to demonstrate the issue. It's not possible to compare the two issues in this context due to different architectures and functionalities. Titanium addressed many of the issues other frameworks have in the past simply by being around longer but may have issues they do not have, so a Titanium test case would help to see the actual issue. Thanks!
   
   *EDIT*: Are you sure you don't just mean the existing [swipeToClose \[true/false\]](<a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#</a>!/api/Titanium.UI.Window-property-swipeToClose) property? Because that's what the linked pull request also does (using <code>gestureRecognizerShouldBegin:</code>). It was added to Titanium in 5.2.0, around 2015. Try it out! :-)</li>

   You're awesome [~hknoechel]!
   
   That is exactly the exposed property I was looking for. Didn't realise it was called that.
   I was hunting for disabledback equivalents. 
   
   This solves the issue for me. Thank you!</li>
