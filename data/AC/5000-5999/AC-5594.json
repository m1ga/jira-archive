It's not possible to compare the two issues in this context due to different architectures and functionalities. Titanium addressed many of the issues other frameworks have in the past simply by being around longer but may have issues they do not have, so a Titanium test case would help to see the actual issue. Thanks!\r\n\r\n*EDIT*: Are you sure you don't just mean the existing [swipeToClose \\[true/false\\]|http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#!/api/Titanium.UI.Window-property-swipeToClose] property? Because that's what the linked pull request also does (using {{gestureRecognizerShouldBegin:}}). It was added to Titanium in 5.2.0, around 2015. Try it out! :-)",
