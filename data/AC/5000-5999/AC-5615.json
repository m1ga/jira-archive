		"description": "When the user doesn't have credit card on apple acount, when he click's on purchase inside the app, he is redirected to appstore to add a new card. At this moment, Storekit module fire's TRANSACTION_STATE_FAILED event with cancelled 'true'. When the user finish the credit card addition and confirm the purchase, purchased event is fired, but my app is not listenning to this event anymore, because the purchased was 'cancelled'.\r\n\r\n{code:java}\r\nStorekit.addEventListener('transactionState', function(evt) {\r\n    hideLoading();\r\n    switch (evt.state) {\r\n        case Storekit.TRANSACTION_STATE_FAILED:\r\n        \t\t//second, when the user goes to add a credit card, TRANSACTION_STATE_FAILED with cancelled 'true' is called.\r\n            break;\r\n        case Storekit.TRANSACTION_STATE_PURCHASED:\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t//third, when the user ends the credit card addition and confirms the purchase, TRANSACTION_STATE_PURCHASED is fired.\r\n            break;\r\n        case Storekit.TRANSACTION_STATE_PURCHASING:\r\n          \t//first, TRANSACTION_STATE_PURCHASING is fired.\r\n            break;\r\n\t\tcase Storekit.TRANSACTION_STATE_DEFERRED:\r\n            break;\r\n    }\r\n});\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nTo reproduce this issue, use the example of storekit module:\r\nhttps://github.com/appcelerator-modules/ti.storekit/blob/master/ios/example/app.js\r\n\r\nBut it's only possible to reproduce on production, since it's not possible to add a credit card on sandbox environment.\r\n\r\nSometimes when the user goes to add a new credit card, the app is restarted.

Because is the amount of time it can take for the user to add the credit card and make the purchase. The problem is that in this time the app can be closed by the operating system and I never receive the success transaction.",
