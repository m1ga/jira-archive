<h3>Description</h3>

There is not enough functionnalities for accessibility.
The main problem is that it is impossible to define a a11y order different from the visual order.

In a "column-layout", it is a major problem.

For example, one property to provide should be <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/nsobject/1615143-shouldgroupaccessibilitychildren" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/nsobject/1615143-shouldgroupaccessibilitychildren</a>

Thank you.

   I agree. Can you list all properties that are relevant? The SDK change looks minor (exposing setter for them), so if you can provide the API's, we could plan and implement it over the next releases. Please also let us know if you see parity with Android.</li>

   I have no experience with native development so it is not easy for me to give you the native specs with Android, neither all the iOS properties that are usefull.
   So I need some help</li>

   Hello [~gduthieuw], We need the list of properties that are relevant. After that, we can move into production. Thanks. </li>
