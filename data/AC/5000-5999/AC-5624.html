<h3>Description</h3>

We are using Appium tool in our test automation process.
In Appium, we only get the "Absolute xPath" but it changes frequently.
So, we need "relative xPath" (eg. name, content-desc or resource-id)  to locate the UI elements on the screen.

*Steps to reproduce:*
1. Create an Appcelerator application.
2. Create a view and assign Id to that view.
3. Inspect that view using Appium test automation tool.

*Actual result*
Not getting the name or content-desc in Appium

*Expected result*
We need to get the name, content-desc or resource-id property

index.xml
<Alloy>    
   <Window class="container">
       <View id="testingView"/>
   </Window>
</Alloy>

   Hello [~pbansode],
   Thanks for sharing with us. Can you please try using the latest SDK 7.0.2.GA and let us know if the issue occurs in the latest SDK .

   Hi Mostafizur,
   
   I used the SDK 7.0.2.GA to create an application, but this issue is still there in SDK 7.0.2.GA</li>

   Did this ever work? We're just starting out with Appium and looking for the same fields to automate our testing. Was this implemented in another SDK? </li>

   We have created application using titanium SDK 5.4.0.GA, 6.3.0.GA and 7.0.2.GA.
   But, it didn't work on any of these SDK.</li>

   We're very new to Appium, and struggled with finding the controls as well. We are using accessibilityLabel and, while not perfect, gives my QA staff enough to get to a control. </li>
