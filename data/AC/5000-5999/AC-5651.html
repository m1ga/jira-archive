<h3>Description</h3>

Hello,

Im trying to run an android app to a device and simulator via the cli, but the build is failing with

[ERROR] Failed to run dexer:
[ERROR]
[ERROR]

I can build the app to the device and simulator ok using Studio, but not cli.

Ive attached my log files for the successful and failed builds, as well as my ti config and android ti info.  I noticed in the the build logs, the build commands are different between studio and cli, but if I use the Studio build command in terminal, I get the same failure.  

my cli build command is appc run -p android -T device -C "FA6920317145"

Ive tried Android API 25 and 26, as well as build tools 25 and 26.  All my Android SDKs are updated, please see screenshot.

If someone could please review my attached build logs and let me know if something sticks out, I would appreciate it, I'm stumped.

Thanks,
Eric

   Hello, Is this started to happen on 7.0.2.GA? Are you able to build for Android in the previous SDK? Make sure you are not under a firewall by the connection provider or behind a smart switch that blocks certain URLs? Let us know by a trace log "appc run -p android -l trace". Thanks.</li>

   Hi Sharif,
   
   cli-trace.txt attached.  ive only tried this with 7.0.2, ill try something lower.  we're having a stripe module built and this is a simple test app.  if i remove the module it works fine.
   
   but again whats troubling me is that i can run the app fine with Studio, but with the cli it breaks.
   
   Thanks

   ok so im seeing now we built this module for 7.0.2 so i cant run the build at a lower sdk level.  ill have to ask my contractor  to do so.
   
   Thanks</li>
<li>eric harms 2018-03-09

   but please let me know if you see anything in the logs.  i feel like something in my cli isnt set up correctly.</li>

   [~eric.harms@gmail.com], Thanks for your feedback. Can you please share a simple test case to reproduce the issue on our end?</li>
<li>eric harms 2018-03-12

   Hi,
   
   unfortunately i believe something in the module we are building is not playing well with the cli.
   
   Is there not a way we can get more information on what is actually failling?
   
   is there anything in the trace log that I posted that might shed some light?
   
   Thanks</li>
<li>eric harms 2018-03-12

   if there is a way I can upload the sample project without it being public, Id be happy to provide you guys the code so you can run it on your end, please let me know.
   
   Thanks</li>
