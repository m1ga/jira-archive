<h3>Description</h3>

We recently purchased a Pro seat for developing our cross-platform apps only to find that the mobile web support has been deprecated and there is no specific reason we could find on the official site regarding to this decision. As the appcelerator's plans will heavily affect any decisions that we need to be made in our app development, can you please let us know that if you have a plan to reopen the mobile web SDK in the future?

   Hello, Mobile Web has been deprecated in Titanium SDK 6.0.0 and completely removed in 7.0.0. Currently, there is no hope of it being available in the future. Thanks.</li>

   Hi Sharif,
   
   Thanks for the answer but we do want to know why it has been deprecated. Mobile web is a great platform that allows us to write web UI in JS. Without it Titanium will lose its competitiveness and lots of its users might consider moving to other platforms such as Xamarin, React Native...</li>
</ol>
