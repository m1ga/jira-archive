   Hello [~alitanergoksu@barkodyazilimevi.com], 
   Would you be able to provide more information for the issues you are experiencing? For example is this something previously working? if so, what SDK where you using? If this is a new issue can you share a simple test app to recreate? 
   
   Best</li>

   Hello, Your description is not clear. You need to provide more information on your issue. Perhaps a sample code of a function that you want and having problem with SDK. Is this is purely codding help you are asking? Please ask in our community site. Thanks.</li>
