   Hi [~sonufana4u], do you have any related crash logs? Does this happen on other devices running Android 5 as well?</li>
<li>sonufana4u 2018-03-29

   Hello Rene.Actually bug is posted by client.One of the users facing this issue on his device.Client shared me few crash logs but am not sure which one belongs to this.I'll share crash logs soon.I tried on other Android 5 but didn't get the issue.
   
   *Report from user :*
   I upgraded phones two days ago and no longer have the issue on my new Pixel 2 XL. The issue remains on my Samsung Note 3. I still have the Note 3 with the app installed and was able to duplicate the issue just now. When I try to touch the share button next to the photo it will hesitate and then the app will crash and an error message saying "Unfortunately XYZ has stopped." appears. I reported the issue again and have included the logs.</li>
