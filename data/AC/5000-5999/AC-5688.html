<h3>Description</h3>

I have java 1.8 installed in my build path and use 7.0.2.GA SDK.
I need to build android module.

I cannot build for java 1.8 - java 1.7 does not support method references.

<code><pre>
Api2.java:33: error: method references are not supported in -source 1.7
[ERROR]                 .flatMap(ApiResponse::handleError)
</pre></code>

Please help how to use java 1.8 with your SDK and/or toolchain.
The same code built from Android Studio 3.0.1 with no problem. But the main app project is appcelerator's, I cannot use Android Studio.

   This was done on purpose. We currently only support Java 7 language features. We added Java 7 support as of Titanium 7.0.0. You can compile with JDK 8, but we purposely set up the Java compiler to build with Java 7, which is the <code>-source 1.7</code> argument you see in the log.
   
   The reason we don't support the Java 8 language is because Google does not fully support Java 8 yet. See the link below. Some Java 8 features are supported on all Android OS versions, such as method references. But there are other Java 8 features that are only supported on Android 7.0 (aka: API Level 24) and higher... and this is the main problem that is best avoided.

   Also, the impression is that Android's Java 8 support is not fully debugged yet either...

   Java 7 has the best support on Android at the moment. Especially since it's supported on all Android OS versions. So, the plan is to stick to Java 7 until the Java 8 situation on Android improves.</li>
