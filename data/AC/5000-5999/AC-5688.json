					"body": "This was done on purpose. We currently only support Java 7 language features. We added Java 7 support as of Titanium 7.0.0. You can compile with JDK 8, but we purposely set up the Java compiler to build with Java 7, which is the {{-source 1.7}} argument you see in the log.\r\n\r\nThe reason we don't support the Java 8 language is because Google does not fully support Java 8 yet. See the link below. Some Java 8 features are supported on all Android OS versions, such as method references. But there are other Java 8 features that are only supported on Android 7.0 (aka: API Level 24) and higher... and this is the main problem that is best avoided.\r\nhttps://developer.android.com/studio/write/java8-support.html#supported_features\r\n\r\nAlso, the impression is that Android's Java 8 support is not fully debugged yet either...\r\nhttps://developer.android.com/studio/write/java8-support.html#disable\r\n\r\nJava 7 has the best support on Android at the moment. Especially since it's supported on all Android OS versions. So, the plan is to stick to Java 7 until the Java 8 situation on Android improves.",
