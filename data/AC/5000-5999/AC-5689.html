<h3>Description</h3>

We are using a table view inside our application to display a list. The reason we have used a Table view is to implement swipe interaction (like Gmail) and perform some action when the user swipes left or right on any row. the same was not achievable on a listview.  

One row of the table view contains the following components, 
1. Container view 
2. inside container view (1) ScrollableView
 Scrollable View has two pages, the main page to show the required data, and a second page to show the action component which would appear after the user swipes the row. 

We have observed that rows render properly for the first time but after some time the rows become blank on Android. Please refer the screenshot.
Once we perform any scroll action on the table view the rows go back to their original state and show the expected data correctly.

   Hello [~pbansode], Thanks for sharing with us. Please provide a full sample test code that regenerates the issue. Better to provide a sample app as an attachment here. We will test the issue in our environment. Also, provide the SDK and CLI version you are testing on. Thanks.</li>

   I have attached similar structure, the one we used in the app. We are not able to reproduce the same issue with this, but just check out whether it helps to you. </li>

   [~pbansode],
   Thanks for providing the project. We are unable to reproduce the issue on our end using SDK 7.1.0.GA and android  device Samsung Galaxy J7. The listview is working as expected.</li>
