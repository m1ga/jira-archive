					"body": "This is intended implicit behavior. In Titanium 7.1.0 and onwards, strict mode is required.\r\n\r\nWe introduced Babel in node-titanium-sdk@0.2.0 to replace UglifyJS for parsing the code to find Titanium symbols. We also started using Babel to minify source. This shipped with Titanium SDK 6.1.0.GA on May 26, 2017. This means that since 6.1.0, all device and distribution builds would be minified and strict mode would be introduced.\r\n\r\nThis explains why 6.3.0 works for simulator (i.e. no minify), but dist builds fail, as well as all 7.1.0 builds fail.\r\n\r\nWe didn't start transpiling the code until node-titanium-sdk@0.4.7, which shipped with 7.1.0.GA on March 14, 2018. Transpilation is disabled by default and can be enabled in the tiapp.xml.\r\n\r\nTitanium does not have a flag to disable strict mode, nor do I think Babel would allow you to disable strict mode.\r\n\r\nHowever, you can disable minification by passing in the {{\\-\\-skip\\-js\\-minify}} flag to the build command or toggle the checkbox in Studio when building an app for distribution.",
