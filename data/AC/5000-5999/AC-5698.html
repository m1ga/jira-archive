   Sorry, but this ticket is missing *all* fundamental information required in order to validate it. From experience, you are likely talking about the "Ti.App.*" namespace not being found in iOS 11.3+ WebViews. This is a known native iOS issue and has been workarounded in Ti SDK 7.1.0+ that has been released a few weeks ago - actually before 11.3 was released. More infos can be found in TIMOB-25762. 
   
   For next time, please always add your full environment to prevent the ticket to be resolved as <code>Invalid</code>. This includes:
   - Ti SDK version
   - OS + version (e.g. iOS, 11.3)
   - Reproducible test case
   - Crash logs (if applicable)</li>

   Thanks for your response.
   It is exactly my prtoblem.
   Is there a workaround for this issue for SDK 5.5? 
   I cant upgrade to 7.1 with my current code?
   Is there a way to open appcelerator intent without the Ti?
