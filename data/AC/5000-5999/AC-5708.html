   Hello [~efrancis],
   
   Thanks for sharing with us. Can you please share the screenshot  of your dashboard which displays the issue?</li>

   I didn't get you what exactly you want me to share from the dashboard? I think the dashboard will have the API keys, I don't think its good idea to share the API keys here.
   
   I am sharing the log screenshot of logs

   I have a questions, is it required to have paid plan to test sending emails using email template and SMTP setup? Can I test emails while in Indie plan in development mode. I am asking this because  when SMTP is setup I did receive an email with subject "[AMPLIFY Platform] Mobile Backend Services SMTP Test", but it does not work when calling Cloud.Emails.send

   Hello, Can you please share your SMTP setup info? Make sure you checked the spam folder. Thanks.</li>

   Thanks for the reply.
   
   I am able to resolve the issue. It seems that Gmail was blocking emails. Initially, I setup SMTP by enabling "less secure apps access your account". Also allows access to security check prompts too. But wasn't receiving any emails.
   Then I have created App password and used it in SMTP. Now everything works fine. App password should be the correct way to use Gmail SMTP.

   Thanks for letting us know. Closing this.</li>

   I am still struggling this to work perfectly. Google starts blocking Appcelerator to access SMTP. I have setup 2 step verification and also generated an app password. I have entered the app password successfully. It worked for some time and then again got blocked. Below is the email from google:
   
   Google just blocked someone from signing into your Google Account support@karpoolclub.com from an app that may put your account at risk.
   Less secure app

   Don't recognize this activity?
   If you didn't recently receive an error while trying to access a Google service, like Gmail, from a non-Google application, someone may have your password.
   
   Is Appcelerator server is not accessing securely and does not  support the latest security standards?</li>
