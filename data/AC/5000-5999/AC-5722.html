<h3>Description</h3>

* 1st Screen - "My Contacts" , having all contacts in a list,
* 2nd Screen - "Contact Details", when I clicked on any contact then I open it,
* At "Contact Details" screen showing "Back button" on top left corner [which is used to go back to previous screen, this back button is by default showing by iOS ],

   Your comments sound fairly similar to an existing sample app <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator-se/corporate-directory" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator-se/corporate-directory</a>, please review that app to see how to obtain that functionality.
