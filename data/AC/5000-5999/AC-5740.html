   Extensions are unreliable. You should check the mimetype. <a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#</a>!/api/Titanium.Blob-property-mimeType
   
   Since this is more of a question than a bug, I'm going to resolve this issue right away also, unless you think there really is a bug then I can reopen it.
   
   ps: I recommend asking the community these kind of questions. There is a slack community on tislack.org and stackoverflow is a good go-to as well when using the  titanium tag.</li>

   Rene is correct. You can't rely on <code>nativePath</code>. Especially if the photo comes from the cloud, because we don't have direct file access to the photo... because it might not be stored on SD. Fetching the <code>mimeType</code> property is the way to go.</li>
