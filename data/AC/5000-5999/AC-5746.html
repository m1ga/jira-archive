<h3>Description</h3>

For the last couple of months I've been having the oddest problem and I thought maybe someone has run into this.  I've done a lot of web searching and found nothing like this out there. 

Whenever I launch Ti Studio, Android Device Monitor is launched at the same time.  But not only that, if I kill Android Device Monitor, then it relaunches Android Device Monitor  It also seems to be blocking Studio during the login process such that if I kill Monitor, Studio progresses further.  I tend to have to kill 2 instantiations of Monitor to get Studio running.

This has continued through a number of installs, deletes, and reinstalls and the upgrade from Sierra to High Sierra.

I traced the PIDs back and unfortunately Axway Appcelerator Studio was the Parent PID thru Bash of the Android Device Monitor process.  So it is like the part of Studio that would launch Android Device Monitor has gone haywire on my system.

What's really strange is whatever is causing this is also impacting other editors like Atom as well.

Ran a Virus Scan but found nothing.  

At this point, I can't use Studio because it appears to be waiting to get something from Android Device Monitor that it never gets. I kill Android Device Monitor and it starts up another one and so on.  I'm staring at Studio trying to Import Existing Mobile Project and it is just stuck "Refreshing" with the dialog up.

I haven't made any mods to Ti Studio - just install it.  Likewise to Atom.

   Found the culprit - garbage in bash init file.  Since Ti Studio uses bash a lot, anything in the bash init file was getting executed every time.
   
   Please delete / close - not an issue.</li>
