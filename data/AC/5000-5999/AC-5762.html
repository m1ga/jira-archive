<h3>Description</h3>

Hi guys, I’ve got a problem with Push notifications - they are randomly undelivered without any error, sometimes it’s delivered almost instantly, sometimes never. Appc administration doesn’t provide any error, when I click on push, in Details section(where should be Show button with details) there is --- and nothing more. Sometimes happens, that PN is delivered according to Appc, but never delivered/late delivered on phone, sometimes is everything working fine(without any changes to code). This is happening mainly on Android, iPhone doesn’t have that problem. Please help, thanks

   Hello, 
   Thanks for sharing with us. Are you using latest SDK? Are you experiencing this in all android devices or any specific device?  Please create a full reproducible test code and provide here for us to test the issue. Also, provide detail affected environment. Thanks.</li>

   Hi Mostafizur,
   I'm using SDK 7.3.0v20180525122818.
   I don't have exact test code, because sometimes PN are delivered on time, but sometimes(randomly) are not delivered at all.
   Main question is, what's the meaning of ---? See attached screenshot. Is there any rules why PN are not delivered(because of time, som peek on demand for another client and so on). Thanks

   Hello, Can you please share a screenshot of the details error, when a PN that is not delivered. If a PN is not delivered you will get the details of the error in details. Thanks.</li>

   Hi Sharif,
   I know, that when PN is not delivered and some error occured, there is error details. What I need to know is, that sometimes is Details unavailable, no error triggered and instead of details there are --- as you can see on screenshot above. Thanks</li>

   Hello,
   Can you please double check on your dashboard  if a PN is not delivered you will get the details of the error . It would be better for investigation if you can send the error message.
   
   Thanks</li>

   Hi,
   as you can see on screenshot above, there is --- on Details, I can't click on it and get any details about push. 
   Is there some policy, that PN can be delivered later and not instantly?
   Also I'd like to know meaning of that ---
   Thanks</li>

   Hello, If one PN is not delivered then there will be error details that can be found in the details. Most probably the PN is delivered but because of network issue, the PN is not delivered. If you see -- in details means there is no details to show and PN is delivered. </li>

   Hi Sharif, I checked my network every time this happens, and internet connection is working fine. No matter if I'm useng 3G/LTE/WiFi, this happens randomly.
   If PN is delivered successfully, there is Details - Show button to show up some additional info(screenshot attached).

   Hello, The issue of yours is a weird one. There is no way to test the issue for validation. Also, it's happening to you randomly. So, there is no possible solution to the issue. I would suggest you do a complete check on your push configuration setup. If those are ok, then when sending PN, try to send multiple, to make sure push is delivered. Thanks.</li>
<li>Marian Kucharcik 2018-06-13

    Hi Sharif,
    thanks for reply. Unfortunately I can't send multiple PN - user place order to our backend and BE sends PN to drivers with info about order. So it's critical for our project that PN is delivered on time(there is reaction time counter that restricts driver to react on order). The problem is, that appc sends me positive reply(that PN was successfully send to appc), but no info if PN was sent to client's phones or not.
    So I'll have to manually check every single PN if it's ok/delivered/error and that it's not possible(there will be hundreds of PN send on daily basis)...</li>
