		"description": "Hi guys, I’ve got a problem with Push notifications - they are randomly undelivered without any error, sometimes it’s delivered almost instantly, sometimes never. Appc administration doesn’t provide any error, when I click on push, in Details section(where should be Show button with details) there is --- and nothing more. Sometimes happens, that PN is delivered according to Appc, but never delivered/late delivered on phone, sometimes is everything working fine(without any changes to code). This is happening mainly on Android, iPhone doesn’t have that problem. Please help, thanks",

So it's critical for our project that PN is delivered on time(there is reaction time counter that restricts driver to react on order). The problem is, that appc sends me positive reply(that PN was successfully send to appc), but no info if PN was sent to client's phones or not.\r\nSo I'll have to manually check every single PN if it's ok/delivered/error and that it's not possible(there will be hundreds of PN send on daily basis)...",
