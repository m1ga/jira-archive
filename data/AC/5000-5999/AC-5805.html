<h3>Description</h3>

Today I can see the design layout of Appcelerator Dashboard. I am trying to configure email Enter proper details in username and SMTP details. It does not give any error and just redirects to the configuration page.

Is there any issue with SMTP email setup?

   I am trying to setup SMTP details in email section of Appcelerator dashboard to send emails using arrowdb emailtemplates. After "Save Changes" it takes you back to configuration page and nothing happened. No configurations are saved or not even it tries to save the configuration, which generates an email. It's working for my other app which was configured earlier before this new dashboard.</li>
