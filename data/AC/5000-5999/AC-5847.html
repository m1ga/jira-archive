<h3>Description</h3>

When installing the latest CLI 7.0.5 with "appc setup" this error is shown during package loading. 

└ package/appcd Failed to install appcd@1.1.3; it may not support your current OS.

The installation finished ok. But, in "appc ti setup check" you can see the "appcd" package is showing missing with a red cross. 

My OS is macOS High Sierra 10.13.6. Any idea why?

   I cannot reproduce, however I suspect the problem is due to your Node.js version being too old. The Appc Daemon requires Node.js 8.0 or newer.
   
   Please install the latest Node.js 8.x release. Uninstall the botched 7.0.5 release by first downgrading to 7.0.4:
   
   <code><pre>
   appc use 7.0.4
   </pre></code>
   
   Remove the botched 7.0.5:
   
   <code><pre>
   rm -rf ~/.appcelerator/install/7.0.5
   </pre></code>
   
   Then run setup again:
   
   <code><pre>
   appc setup
   </pre></code>
   
   Let me know if that solves it.</li>

   Don't you mean <code>rm -rf ~/.appcelerator/install/7.0.5</code>?</li>

   Fixed typo. Thanks!</li>

   Just re-tested and I cannot reproduce the issue.
   
   Do you have enough free disk space?
   
   What happens if you do the following?
   
   <code><pre>
   mkdir ~/appctest
   cd ~/appctest
   npm i node-ios-device
   </pre></code></li>

   Hello [~cbarber], Good news, I again tried to do the same thing on your first recommendation. This time all the packages installed perfectly. No issue now. But I am not sure why this was happening before. Thanks for the help. I will close it. </li>

   [~sdarda] That's great that you got it working.
   
   The problem you ran into, as indicated in your log output, is a permission issue. I recommend that you never run "npm install" with "sudo" unless you are specifying the <code>-g</code> global flag. The problem with using "sudo" when installing something in your user directory is the files will be owned by root instead of your user. This is especially bad when installing npm packages since the packages get cached and are owned by root. You should probably fix the file permissions in your npm cache.</li>
