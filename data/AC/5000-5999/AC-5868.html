<h3>Description</h3>

Appcelrator Studio works well with local projects. Then there is no mistake when creating an iOS build (emulator and device).

When using git projects, I can not build an iOS build. It sometimes works in the emulator. But it does not work with an iOS device. The same errors come when I want to build via the console.

Sometimes switching to another emulator helps. Unfortunately, Project Clean does not help either. Currently it is almost impossible to test the iOS version. I urgently need help or a tip, so it works again.

I get the following errors:

<code><pre>
xcodebuild[59498:2586020]  DTDeviceKit: deviceType from 96194bbc... was NULL
</pre></code>

<code><pre>
** BUILD FAILED **
The following build commands failed:
ProcessPCH build/Intermediates/PrecompiledHeaders/XXX_Prefix-frmiqojbtdejutawwhxlnbksjklr/XXX_Prefix.pch.pch XXX_Prefix.pch normal {color:#d04437}x86_64{color} objective-c com.apple.compilers.llvm.clang.1_0.compiler
</pre></code>

Instead of {color:#d04437}x86_64{color}  => Sometimes also {color:#d04437}armv7{color} or {color:#d04437}arm64{color}

Thanks

   Hello, Can you send the full trace log? Please run the command with -l trace and send the log. Thanks.</li>
<li>Antje Schattat 2018-08-31

   Sure, I tried creating a build from the console.
   
   <code><pre>
   appc run -p ios -l trace -C "E95DA738...."
   </pre></code>
   
   The app could not be opened in the emulator, it came back the error. The full log is the added file (log.txt). [^log.txt] 
   
   The log for the build on the iOS device I can not send until the next week, when I'm back in the office.
   
   Thanks</li>

   Hello, I have also uploaded the log  [^log_device.txt] from the build to the device. In addition, sometimes this error comes
   
   <code><pre>
   xcodebuild[59498:2586020]  DTDeviceKit: deviceType from 96194bbc... was NULL
   </pre></code>
   
   if the device is connected via USB and I want to do a build in the emulator.
   
   For local projects I do not have these problems!</li>

   Is there really no explanation for my problem? I can test the project in question very cumbersome for iOS. It does not work on the device.</li>

   Hello [~aschattat], Is the issue still there for SDK 7.4.0GA and the 7.4.1 releases?</li>
<li>Antje Schattat 2018-10-25

   Hello. I tested it again. Conclusion: Simulator usually works when Appcelerator Studio is restarted. Or clean / delete build folder sometimes helps too. It does not work with an iPhone. I will try it with another iPhone with iOS12.
   
   - Titanium SDK 7.4.1.GA
   - Simulator iPhone XS with iOS
   => Works
   
   - Titanium SDK 7.4.1.GA
   - iPhone 7 with iOS11
   => Error
