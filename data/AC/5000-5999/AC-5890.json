					"body": "Hello [~michael], I tested the sample code provided by [~rmitro], I wasn't able to reproduce the issue as you described. For me, and Rakhi the app works as expected before and after closing and reopening the app. I am able to see the same behavior after the app reopens. Each time after taking the image the image is shown in the window. No red screen (like the first open). I am testing on Nokia 6 (Android 8.1.0). Can you confirm this on any Android 8 version? We need to make sure this is happing in lower version than Android 8. Thanks.",
