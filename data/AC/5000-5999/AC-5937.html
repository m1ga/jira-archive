<h3>Description</h3>

After updating Appcelerator Studio to the latest version I have this problem: right after I compile an app for iOS, and the app runs correctly, the IDE will freeze for a few seconds and it'll work again.

Console log:

[TRACE] :  updating tiapp metadata with Appcelerator Platform...

[freezes 10 seconds]

[TRACE] :  Uploaded tiapp metadata with Appcelerator Platform!

Appcelerator studio logs are empty during this.

   Unfortunately no screencast software let me show you the mouse loading cursor, but it takes almost 1 minute to upload the tiapp metadata (and in the mean time Appcelerator Studio is frozen).</li>

   Hello, The freeze issue in iOS 12 was reported multiple time. We sugggest using SDK 7.4.1.GA with iOS 12. There been some major updates regarding iOS 12 issue in this relaase. Let us know after test. Thanks.</li>

   the freeze here is happening on Appcelerator Studio, nothing to do with iOS (this happens with iOS 9 as well). Why does it take so long to update the metadata?
   
   I updated to 7.4.1 and while my app seems not to crash too often, Studio always hangs for a while.</li>

   btw, this doesn't happen on Atom (life saver). I even deleted everything and reinstalled everything.</li>
