<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Steps to Reproduce</h4>
I am having a Titanium project in which I am making changes in .js file in app>> controller>>lib  folder. After making changes it should reflect the changes, when I run the app, but it is not. 

At the same time, other team member is making change to the same code on his machine, it works. 

I even did the project clean, but issue remains

<h4>Actual Result</h4>
As recommened instead of 

var dbLib = require('database');

used

var dbLib = require('./database');

Getting error

[ERROR] :  Script Error {
[ERROR] :      column = 20;
[ERROR] :      line = 15;
[ERROR] :      message = 'undefined is not an object (evaluating 'db.getIsLoading')';

<h4>Expected Result</h4>
Change to database.js file in app>>controller>>lib folder must not show the error.

   [~mr.jatinjoshi.mca@gmail.com] What do you mean by "As recommened instead of", do you mean logging from the SDK like "require called with un-prefixed module id:"?</li>
<li>JATIN JOSHI 2018-10-04

   I meant, as recommended by Appcelerator in the logs: 
   
   [WARN] :   The requested path 'database' has a collison between a native Titanium API/module and a JS file.
   [WARN] :   The native Titanium API/module will be loaded in preference.
   [WARN] :   If you intended to address the JS file, please require the path using a prefixed string such as require('./database') or require('/database') instead.
   
   I upgraded the app from SDK 5.5.1 to SDK 7.4.0</li>

   Have you tried the second require <code>require('/database')</code> in that log? The one you're using will try to require the file relative the file you're using (so if it's in the same directory it will succeed), whereas <code>require('/database')</code> will work if the file resides under the <code>app/lib</code> folder in an Alloy app</li>

   [~mr.jatinjoshi.mca@gmail.com] did the <code>require('/database')</code> work?</li>
<li>JATIN JOSHI 2018-10-08

   No. I have been trying to rebuild the app, but no changes, that I can see it on front end. 
   
   Project was developed by previous developer and code was checked in github. I pulled that code and then imported into appcelerator and then ran. Got the message, Resources folder missing. 
   
   I asked for the Resources folder from that developer and placed in the root folder, but still no changes are reflected. If I a make any change in the Resource folder files, that shows, but making change in views of controller file of the project, no changes are seen. </li>

   Hello [~mr.jatinjoshi.mca@gmail.com], What happens if you make changes in js file and after saving, try running the project through terminal? Thanks.</li>
<li>JATIN JOSHI 2018-10-09

   This issue is fixed: 
   
   Don't know how but when I deleted the Resources folder and again compiled the project by using:
   
   appc alloy compile --config platform=ios
   
   It recreated the Resources folder and project started working and my changes were reflected. </li>
