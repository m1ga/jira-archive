if anyone could try to get logs of it, i have no idea if a production version would help in this case

We can't debug on a device with iOS 12 locally, a first problem we had was with iOS 11 update and changing the use-js-core-framework tag to false fixed it, but with iOS 12 other problem appeared, Attached are the tiapp.xml for help

   Hello, Can you please attach a sample project that generates the issue in iOS 12 device? We will test in our environment. Thanks.</li>

    I am able to run attached app using use-js-core-framework true or false in my iPhone  with iOS 12.0. I am not facing any crash.
    1. In iOS 12 we are facing issue as mentioned in TIMOB-26391. We have fixed issue in SDK 7.4.1. Can you please test it using same. You get 7.4.1 using CLI  command-
        appc ti sdk install -b 7_4_X
    2. There is some certificate issue going on from apple side . See <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52440492/ios-app-wont-run-on-device-any-more-under-ios-12-unrecoverable-ct-signature-is." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52440492/ios-app-wont-run-on-device-any-more-under-ios-12-unrecoverable-ct-signature-is.</a>
   
   It will be great if you can share crash logs or reproducible test case. Thanks!</li>

   Thank you for answering, my problem was indeed that item 2 that you cited, one of my certificates were on the "Always Trust" status for some reason and i couldn't get that error message because only on a device with iOS 12 installing an enterprise app would catch it.
   
   I also used the 7.4.1 SDK with the main app and it's running fine, i think that my problem wasn't related to the SDK in the end so you can close this issue now.
   
   Again thanks for the attention.</li>
