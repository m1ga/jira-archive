   I had renamed Plugins folder as MyUtils, Now i am getting some Architecture error, Check the attached screenshot for error info. Please guide how i could get it resolved.</li>

   [~pkumar] what is <code>plugin/utils</code>, is it a js file? A folder? There's not a lot of info here to try aiding you, and I'm not really seeing anything pointing to this being a bug in the SDK. Maybe it'd be better to try and look for support on [tislack](<a href="https://tislack.org/)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://tislack.org/)</a> here?</li>

   Hello [~pkumar], Can you please get back here? Did you look for support in tislack? </li>
<li>Praveen Kumar 2018-10-16

   No have not did that before.
   I just created new account in tislack, you can find me with the name "praveen437"</li>
<li>Sharif AbuDarda 2018-10-16

   Hello [~pkumar], Ask for support in there. Thanks.</li>
<li>Praveen Kumar 2018-10-17

   Yeah Sharif, i am already asked for the support, i just added the screenshot of my query. If possible can we have a webex session to resolve the issue, that may resolve the issue quickly.
   
   Thanks

   Hello [~pkumar], Please assign the tislack issue link in here? do, you still facing the issue with SDK 7.5.0.GA?</li>
<li>Praveen Kumar 2018-11-30

   HI Sharif,
   
   I have moved my whole classes and files in to a new project, that solved my issue, you can close this issue.
   
   Thanks
