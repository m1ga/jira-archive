<h3>Description</h3>

This app functioned fine under iOS 11 with any 7.4.x SDK on simulator and iPhone 6 hardware.  However, after upgrading iPhone 6 to iOS 12, app runs in simulator, but no longer on iPhone 6 hardware.  I've tried a number of 7.4.1.v2018* (including debug) SDKs, but they all crash immediately on my iPhone 6 hardware.  Symptom: splash screen comes up, but then app appears to crash/background.  UI never comes up.  I need to force close it.

iOS 12 and iOS 12.0.1 has same issue for iPhone 6 device.

Fazlul (on Appcelerator chat) says it works fine on his iOS 12 iPhone 5s.  I am trying to update a spare iPhone 5 (not 5s) to iOS 12.0.1 now to see if it also works.  Not sure why it matters, but hey, I'm game if it helps us figure out the issue.

Slimmed down app source is attached.

   Hello, Any crash log that you can share here in your test for iOS 12 iPhone 6? </li>
<li>Daniel Levine 2018-10-13

   For some reason, when I try to debug on my device through Studio, it doesn’t connect. So I don’t get anything that way. However, a co-worked got something via Xcode that might be helpful.

   Crash log from Xcode uploaded. </li>
<li>Sharif AbuDarda 2018-10-13

   Looking into your log, it's not related anyway to issue in Titanium SDK. Can you ask your co-worker how he get the log, I believe this is purely Xcode log and the issue in iOS12 with iPhone 6 is also occurring in the Xcode. Is he able to run native apps in the device? Thanks.</li>
<li>Daniel Levine 2018-10-14

   I'm not sure why, but when I try to debug on my iOS 12 device, debug gets to the last stage and the debugger doesn't know I started the app manually, as requested in that step.  The app crashes immediately  after bringing up the splash screen without anything getting spit out.
   
   Any chance you could try to build the simple project I uploaded, and try it on iOS 12 hardware as well as simulator and reproduce my results?  iOS 11 should work fine in both simulator and hardware.
   
   Perhaps you can see what you need to see when it crashes.  I'd love to fix my environment, but I'm not quite sure what's wrong.</li>

   There is some certificate issue going on from apple side . See <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52440492/ios-app-wont-run-on-device-any-more-under-ios-12-unrecoverable-ct-signature-is" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52440492/ios-app-wont-run-on-device-any-more-under-ios-12-unrecoverable-ct-signature-is</a> if this can help you. Thanks!</li>

   Hi,
   
   Recently i faced the same issue.
   
   I modified "Always Trust" to "Use System Defauls" for my distribution certificate from the keychain access, then create the build and test.
   give it a try, it may resolve the issue.</li>
<li>Daniel Levine 2018-10-17

   Thanks, it sounds like a perfect match for my issue, however all the certificates appear to be set this way already.
   
   Anyone try to build and run on a device?</li>
<li>Daniel Levine 2018-10-17

   Here's my co-worker's response regarding the log I posted:
   
   It is a crash log from the device.
   
   Yes, he can run other apps he builds on the device.</li>

    [~dlevine] I ran your attached app. It is working fine for me with latest  module of 'com.appceelerator.apm'. I believe you are using apm module's  3.0.0 or earlier version which do not support iOS 12. Please use 3.1.0 or later version of apm module. Thanks!</li>
<li>Daniel Levine 2018-10-18

    Ok, I think you're onto something.  When I click the comm.appcelerator.apm module in the Studio UI of the Overview Tab for tiapp.xml, it says it will use the latest.  However, if I look at the choices for specifying a version, 3.0 is the latest one I have.  So it looks like I need 3.1.  When I check fr Appcelerator updates in Studio, it says I'm up to date.  How do I get this?  CLI is fine for me.</li>
<li>Daniel Levine 2018-10-18

    I tried making a new mobile project with Enable Axway Appcelerator Platform Services checked (default) and expected that a new version of com.appcelerator.apm would get downloaded and then I could select it, but I still only see 3.0.0, 2.0.0, 1.1.5, and 1.1.1 as my choices.  I restarted Studio, but no change in my module versions.  Something seems to be preventing me from getting it.  SDK is 7.4.1.v20181008103750.</li>
<li>Daniel Levine 2018-10-18

    Since apm module isn't essential to my app, I deleted it from the app's tiapp.xml Overview UI tab, cleaned the project and built.  Pushed to the device and yes it works.  So if we can overcome this issue, we're good to go.</li>
<li>Daniel Levine 2018-10-18

    Ok, looks like the issue is resolved.  Originally we had an Enterprise License and APM module was added to this project when it was created (perhaps by default).  We don't use APM in the project.  When we renewed the license, we didn't keep the Enterprise level capability.  SO we no longer get newer APM modules.  I'll remove this unnecessary module from the project and I believe we are good to go.  Great detective work figuring out the cause though.
    
    Thanks!</li>
