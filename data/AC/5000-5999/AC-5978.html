   Hello, Can you try deleting your build folder and re-build your project? This workaround sometimes works. Thanks.</li>

   Hello,
   
   Can you try the following and let us know how it goes.
   
   * Run  'appc ti sdk install -b master' followed by an 'appc ti sdk select' .
   
   * Clean your project ,then build.
   
   Thanks</li>
