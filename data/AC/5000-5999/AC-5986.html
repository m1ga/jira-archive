<h3>Description</h3>

In the process of upgrading to Titanium SDK 7.4.1.GA (as of some major issues with iOS12), I've installed and set up latest XCode 10.0, but running an *Enterprise AdHoc build* gives me the error
<code><pre>
[INFO] :   Invoking xcodebuild
[INFO] :   Packaging for Ad Hoc distribution
[ERROR] :  Failed to export archive to ipa
[ERROR] :  The selected provisioning profile "Corporate App (abc123)" is most likely not a valid Ad Hoc provisioning profile.
[ERROR] :  Please ensure you are using a valid Ad Hoc provisioning that is linked to the signing identity, then try again.
</pre></code>

this is the build command:
<code><pre>
appc run -p ios -T dist-adhoc -R 'CorporationName' --pp-uuid abc123 -O ./ --ios-version 12.0 --distribution-name 'CorporationName' --deploy-type production --project-dir ./
</pre></code>

Switching the _XCode CLI build tools_ back to 9.2 and using the _--ios-version 11.2_ flag builds and packages the app correctly.

Unfortunately, the iOS12 crashes seem to persist, so I assume I have to get it going with XCode10 to take full advantage of Ti SDK 7.4.1.GA

Could you please help me with this?

   Hi, did you have a chance to check on this?

   [~mkainzbauer], Could you please try with the newly created certificate and provisioning profile?  At first, delete the previous certificate and provisioning profile from the Apple developer account and Keychain Access.
   
   Then let us know how it goes.
   
   Thanks!</li>

   Hi,
   thanks for the suggestion, unfortunately it didn't work out. Have you been able to reproduce it on your side?
   
   Thanks!</li>

   the issue is with a third party module which doesn't compile in XCode 10, ticket can be closed</li>
