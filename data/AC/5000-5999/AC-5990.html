<h3>Description</h3>

Recently i updated the Appcelerator Studio version from 5.0.0 to 5.1.1. In 5.1.1, unable to run the app in my android device because my device name is not displaying in the studio. But it is showing in CLI.
These are the Android SDK i installed in studio 6.0, 7.1.1, 8.0.0, 8.1.0
I tried with the titanium SDK 7.0.1, 7.3.0, 7.4.0 and 7.4.1

   Hello, Is this only happening ofr studio 5.1.1 version? what is your android device version and model name? Also, can you try with a different Android device to see if the issue is there or specifically for your device? Let us know after test. Thanks. </li>

   I tested with the following devices.
   Honor 9 Lite - Android Version 8.0.0
   Honor 4x - Android version 6.0.1
   Honor 4x - Android version 4.4.4
   
   Previously i used stdio 5.0.0. In that i was able to connect all my devices. But after updating stdio to 5.1.1, unable to connect my devices. 
   Can you share me the link for download old version of Titanium Studio?</li>

   Hi [~anbu_math@yahoo.co.in],
   Please follow the steps below and let us know how it goes:
   Goto your android sdk path and run adb.exe. Typical location for adb is the path to your android-sdk\platform-tools\adb.exe. Now, execute the commands below:
   <code><pre>
   adb kill-server
   adb start-server
   </pre></code>
   Next, restart your system. Open studio now and check if you can see the device.
   We always recommend to use latest studio builds. If you still want to use older version, you can refer to the link [here](<a href="https://titanium-studio.s3.amazonaws.com/5.0.0/Appcelerator_Studio.dmg)." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://titanium-studio.s3.amazonaws.com/5.0.0/Appcelerator_Studio.dmg).</a>

   Hi [~anbu_math@yahoo.co.in],
   Studio [5.1.2.RC](<a href="https://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#</a>!/guide/Studio_5.1.2.RC_Release_Note) is out now. Please verify the issue on latest version. If you still experience the same then you can try the following steps:
   
   1. Connect the device to the PC
   2. Run the following command on your command line for restarting the android plugin
   <code><pre>
   appc appcd exec /appcd/plugin/stop/appcd-plugin-android && appc appcd exec /android/latest/info/devices
   </pre></code>
   3. Now check the device from the Studio "Run" option, if you donâ€™t see the device then click the Refresh Devices or Restart the Studio
   
   Let us know the update.
   
   Thanks!
