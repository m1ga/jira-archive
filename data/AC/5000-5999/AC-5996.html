<h3>Description</h3>

AppStudio is no longer finding the Genymotion virtual devices. I have un-installed, re-installed  Studio and Genymotion with no luck. If I connect a physical device then it works but not a Genymotion device even though both are visible via ADB as follows:

$ adb devices -l
List of devices attached
ZY222ZTPKD             device usb:339738624X product:osprey_reteu_2gb model:MotoG3 device:osprey_u2 transport_id:3
192.168.62.101:5555    device product:vbox86p model:Samsung_Galaxy_S8___7_0_0___API_24___1440x2960 device:vbox86p transport_id:4

Seems as though App Studio does not like a device with a short name of an IP address, only thing I can think off.

If I use 

$ appc ti info 

the following is shown which is correct

Genymotion
  Path                        = /Applications/Genymotion.app/Contents/MacOS
  Genymotion Executable       = /Applications/Genymotion.app/Contents/MacOS/genymotion
  Genymotion Player           = /Applications/Genymotion.app/Contents/MacOS/player.app/Contents/MacOS/player
  Home                        = /Users/<user>/.Genymobile/Genymotion

VirtualBox
  Executable                  = /usr/local/bin/VBoxManage
  Version                     = 5.2.20r125813

   Hello, Please check in studio/preferences/platform/android the Genymotion path and the virtual box path is set correctly. Try with a different emulator and set that emulator as default in there. Let us know. Thanks.</li>

   The settings looked all good, I checked them over. In the end to resolve it I did the following
   
   1. appc ti config genymotion.enabled false
   2. Removed every trace of Genymotion and VirtualBox, including the entries in ~home/.Genymotion and /usr/local/bin
   3. Rebooted
   4. Installed Virtualbox and rebooted
   5. Installed Genymotion and rebooted
   6. Check that Genymotion used the inbuilt ADB
   7. appc ti config genymotion.enabled true
   8. Started Genymotion and downloaded a new Android simulator
   9. Start App Studio and emulator was shown
   
   A bit of a pilatha to get there, but in the end removing every traced of the installed seemed to get it working even though all the settings are still the same.</li>
