<h3>Description</h3>

I am facing issue, where my app when upgraded to iOS 12 is working fine, but intermittently crashes after some time and doesn't give any logs in the appcelerator logs. I am not able to understand where the issue is. As suggested that to fix the iOS 12 crashes, when upgrading the apps, I used SDK 7.4.1 but still getting the crash. 

I am unable to share the logs, as it doesn't show when the app crashes. 

When the app crashes, I get to see the message:

-- End application log ------------------------------------------------------- 

and nothing more to find where it crashed. And crash is random at any point on any screen. 

Please help.

   I created the build via xCode 10.1 and found in the log as follows:
   
   2018-10-31 14:38:46.889000-0500 PeopleXapp [1472:389146] *** -[TiUIViewProxy setProxyObserver:]: message sent to deallocated instance 0x1161db400
   warning: could not execute support code to read Objective-C class data in the process. This may reduce the quality of type information available.
   (lldb) 
   
   And the app hangs and nothing tapping anywhere on the screen, no event is fired. </li>

   [~mr.jatinjoshi.mca@gmail.com] This could be duplicate of TIMOB-25391. It is getting fixed as part of 7.5.0 release. 
   If you are facing freeze issue apart from this, please check TIMOB-26391. This is known issue and we are working on this. Jan has given a temporary build <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/zasd5dd7j9xl7lx/mobilesdk-7.4.2-osx.zip?dl=0." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.dropbox.com/s/zasd5dd7j9xl7lx/mobilesdk-7.4.2-osx.zip?dl=0.</a> You can check with this. Thanks!</li>
