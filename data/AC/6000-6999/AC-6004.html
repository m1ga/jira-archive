<h3>Description</h3>

I am using Titanium.UI.RefreshControl for iOS inside tableview using Alloy. But when we pull down 3-4 times and and switch the screen in between then its getting crashed..

Can you please suggest on this ?..Client is asking for the status..Am not able to get the crash logs..Attaching 2 videos for the reference..Can't attach the sample code as the project is very big and can't make sample code from that..
