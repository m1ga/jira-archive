<h3>Description</h3>

Just adding some assets for default splash screens…and I’ve noticed some of the dimensions appear wrong? iPhone XS and iPhone XR are the dimensions in question.

The docs can be found here: <a href="https://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#</a>!/guide/Icons_and_Splash_Screens-section-src-29004897_safe-id-SWNvbnNhbmRTcGxhc2hTY3JlZW5zLUljb25zLHNwbGFzaHNjcmVlbnMsYW5kc3RvcmVyZXF1aXJlbWVudHM

iPhone XS Max portrait - 1242x2688 - Default-Portrait-2688h@3x.png
should be 3726x8064

iPhone XS Max landscape - 2688x1242 - Default-Landscape-2688h@3x.png
should be 8064x3726

iPhone XR Max portrait - 828x1792 - Default-Portrait-1792h@2x.png
should be 1656x3584

iPhone XR Max landscape - 1792x828 - Default-Landscape-1792h@2x.png
should be 3584x1656

Could this be confirmed or whether I am wrong?

   It looks like you've doubled/trippled all resolutions twice. The @1x resolution for iPhone XS Max Portrait is actually <code>414x896</code>. This goes for all resolution you've provided.</li>

   Rene is correct and I was being stupid.
   
   Thanks, this ticket can be closed.</li>

   As you mentioned, it was a mistake. However, I don't want to discurage you from creating tickets. At least you got a good answer out of it, so feel free to create tickets when you think something is wrong! So thanks!</li>
