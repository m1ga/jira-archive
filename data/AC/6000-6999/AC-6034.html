   Hello,
   
   We are investigating this issue on our end using a breakpoint. It seems a studio issue. Getting stuck on debug window in couple of mins. Did you experiencing the same? Is debug window opening perfectly on your end? It would be helpful if you share your sample test code, full environment details and screenshot which displays the issue.
