Otherwise could support for this please be added urgently as this is a major limitation.\r\n\r\n*Sample code*\r\n\r\nUsing a UIWebView the following code works:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\nvar win = Ti.UI.createWindow({\r\n  backgroundColor: 'white'\r\n});\r\n\r\nvar html = '<img src=\"app://Resources/abc.jpg\">';\r\n\r\nvar webview = Ti.UI.createWebView({\r\n  html: html\r\n});\r\n\r\nwin.add(webview);\r\nwin.open();\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nNote that in `tiapp.xml` <use-app-thinning> is set to false so that the image can be referenced.\r\n\r\nThe same code using WKWebView does not load the image.

If it works I'll move this code in Ti.WKWebView as well. Thanks!\r\n  ",

					"body": "Hi @vijaysingh I am currently using 7.5.0.GA and the changeset you pointed me is not synonomous as there have been other changes made to TiUIWebView.m in 8.0 outside of just that one changeset.\r\n\r\nSo instead I have switched to experimenting with SDK build 8.0.0.v20181030074154.\r\n\r\nIn testing this, my understanding is that 8.0 will continue to support calls to Ti.UI.createWebView - and it will be switching to use WKWebView under the hoods ... is that correct? So basically I should ignore the module version of WKWebView and just work with Ti.UI.createWebView and it will be taken care of under the hoods? \r\n\r\nI tracked down what looks like the updated docs around these changes [here|https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/blob/3728533ad0938f86bab1780514afd7f5a47ed5c0/apidoc/Titanium/UI/WebView.yml].\r\n\r\nAlso is there an expected timeframe for a 8.0 RC or GA? i.e. is there a target before the end of the year? Or should I not count on this?\r\n\r\nThanks for your help.",
