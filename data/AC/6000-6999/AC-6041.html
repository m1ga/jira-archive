<h3>Description</h3>

The hyperloop examples project no longer runs. When I attempt to build it, the build process exits while outputting the following:

{noformat}
Processing inherited protocols of WKURLSchemeTask <NSObject>
  Iterating over inherited protocols of WKURLSchemeTask
    Processing inherited protocols of NSObject
      NSObject was already merged with all protocols it inherits from.
  Merging NSObject => WKURLSchemeTask
Couldn't resolve typedef: ValueType
Not sure how to handle: name= value type= typedef value= ValueType
Not sure how to handle: name= simd_float3x3 type= record value= simd_float3x3
Couldn't resolve typedef: ObjectType
Not sure how to handle: name= firstObject type= typedef value= ObjectType
Couldn't resolve typedef: ObjectType
Not sure how to handle: name= firstObject type= typedef value= ObjectType
couldn't find class Protocol * {"name":"protocol","optional":false,"type":{"type":"objc_pointer","value":"Protocol *"}}
etc,etc
{noformat}
On the build logs you can see that the process quitted while generating stubs (build log 1).

If I try again, the build process will quit once more, with the following output:

{noformat}
[INFO]  Forcing rebuild: Xcode project has changed since last build
[INFO]  Finished Hyperloop assembly in 6.17 seconds
[INFO]  Invoking xcodebuild
[ERROR] ** BUILD FAILED **
[ERROR] The following build commands failed:

[ERROR] (1 failure)
{noformat}
In the build logs, it can be seen that the frameworks from the podfile have not been generated

{noformat}

{noformat}
I'll attach the build logs

   [~vijaysingh] can you test this too? I tried to reproduce it on my machine but the example project builds just fine. Tested with CocoaPods 1.5.3, Hyperloop 3.1.4 and SDK 7.4.1.GA</li>

   Hello, [~rlustemberg], [~jvennemann], I tried to reproduce the issue with SDK 7.5.0.GA with the sample project in <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/hyperloop-examples" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/hyperloop-examples</a> . With CocoaPods 1.5.3, Hyperloop 3.1.3 I wasn't able to reproduce the issue. The projects run fine on iOS 12 simulator. Thanks.</li>

   I have two computers with the same issue, but I could not reproduce on a colleagues laptop. I wonder if it could be related to have had installed unix tools from brew long time ago (uninstalled already, because it installed its own version of 'cp' which had a different behaviour when copying recursively than the darwin version). AFAIK the CLI tools now should be the standard ones. The build process seems to quit silently while generating stubs. Is there a way to catch the error so that I can troubleshoot on my own?</li>
