					"body": "(I also made this comment on  TIMOB-26538 for visibility)\r\n\r\nThese changes have wrecked our app. From what I understand foreground notifications were created for Android so background services can still run when the app is EXITED. The caveat is that a foreground notification persists in the notification panel so the user knows the app is still using memory.\r\n\r\nIn 7.4.1.GA i can start several background services on android (location tracking, accelerometer, notification scheduling, etc) and when i close the app since I created a foreground notification, the services still run perfectly.\r\n\r\nWith the changes in 7.5/8.0 when i EXIT the app the foreground notification persists, but then crashes because the underlying services are stopped automatically when the app is closed. We also do things with our app on rebooting the device, etc....\r\n\r\nThe workarounds above are only for asking the back button to background the app rather than close it. This does not help. Do we need to create a new ticket?\r\n\r\nWhat do we do?",
