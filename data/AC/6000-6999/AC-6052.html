   Hello,
   
   Thanks for reporting this. Are you experiencing this problem on android emulator or device? It would be great if you can share the complete console logs which displays the issue.
   
   
   </li>
<li>Adam Fennell 2018-12-10

   This happens on device. I've attached the console logs as a txt file.</li>

   Hello,
   
   Check the logs. Did you refer this as an issue?
   <code><pre>
   
   compile F:\Appcelerator_Studio_Workspace\OneSurv\app --config theme=null,platform=android,version=0,simtype=none,devicefamily=none,deploytype=test,target=device --no-colors

   Rakhi
   
   I'm not sure I understand. Do you want me to check the logs? If so, where would I find them.
   
   When you say "Did you refer this as an issue?", I thought this is where we refer issues.
   
   Have I misunderstood your comment?</li>

   [~anfen] this is a known issue that is fixed in ALOY-1638. We'l be rolling out a new CLI in due course to fix this. For now I would recommend to downgrade to 7.0.7</li>
<li>Adam Fennell 2018-12-10

   Great. Could you tell me how to downgrade to 7.0.7 please? I've tried searching the online documentation, but I couldn't find anything.</li>
<li>Ewan Harris 2018-12-10

   You can run <code>appc use 7.0.7</code> in command prompt and it will select that version for you. </li>
<li>Adam Fennell 2018-12-10

   The rollback worked, and the theming is working again. Thanks for your help.</li>
<li>Ewan Harris 2018-12-10

   Closing as a dupe of ALOY-1638</li>
