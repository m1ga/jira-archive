<h3>Description</h3>

Some tests conducted by app on Android device connected to the WiFi module of an IoT device (in access-point mode) we found communication errors TCP Socket. These errors always occur and only in some devices, while in other devices communication does not have problems.

The procedure we perform is a socket communication with a sequence of continuous readings and readings, which are used to configure the IoT WiFi module to connect to the local network. During the procedure the socket reports an error and the communication is interrupted.

The error that is reported by the error event of the TCP socket proxy is as follows:

{color:red}Unable to read from socket, IO error{color}
{color:red}Read from socket I/O error{color}

*The devices at the time that seem to be affected are:*
- Samsung Galaxy J3 â€“ J320FN, Android ver. 5.1.1
- Samsung A6 - Android 8

*It works well on:*
- Tablet Acer A3-A20, Android ver. 4.4.2
- LG K8 (2017) (LG-M200),  Android ver. 8.1.0
- Samsung Galaxy J5 (SM-J500FN), Android 6.0.1
- Huawei MediaPad T3 10 (AGS-w09), Android 7.0
- Samsung A5 (2016) (SM-A510F), Android 7.0

*Works well on iOS devices*

   Hello, We need details of the issue. Where did you get the log? Please send the full log in here. Also, A sample code that regenerates the issue on the mentioned device will be helpful. Thanks.</li>

   Hello, the devices with problems are from third-party users used in field-testing, so I do not have the error stack log, but only the socket proxy message.
   My company is evaluating the purchase of the same smartphone models to verify the error and generate the requested log.</li>

   Did you manage to generate the requested log? Also, A sample test code that regenerates the issue will be helpful to better investigation.</li>

   Hello,
   We are waiting for the log and sample test project to reproduce the issue on our end.. Please let us know if you need any help.</li>

   Hi, we tried to reproduce the problem, but these problems occur on our customers' devices and networks on which we have no possibility to analyze to extract a log.
   Currently another error reported by the socket manager appears to be the following:
   
   {noformat}
   Unable to read from socket. Reason: recvfrom failed: ETIMEDOUT (Connection timed out)
   {noformat}
   
   </li>

   Currently we provide the apk of the Android version to some of our customers who live in other European countries and for which we have no possibility to operate directly on site for analysis.
   I would like to ask you if it is possible in some way to remotely register the trace logs that generate the error so that we can provide them. Thank you</li>

   Hello
   We continue to encounter data read / write problems via TCP sockets.
   The last report concerns the following error that comes from the "onerror" event of the TCP socket client on Android.
   
   {noformat}
   Unable to read from socket. Reason: Software caused connection abort
   {noformat}
   
   Communication errors occur mainly on Samsung devices, in this case a Samsung A5 2017 (SM-A520F).
   There may be some security software pre-installed on Samsung (or other brands) devices that interfere with TCP socket communication, however simple (ascii strings of a few bytes).</li>

   Hello
   With further investigations it seems to be a problem of the firmware of the iot module (Microchip brand) used by our client to which the app connects. We are investigating further to confirm this.</li>
