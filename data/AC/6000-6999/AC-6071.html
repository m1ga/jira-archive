<h3>Description</h3>

Hello,

I've a requirement to disable copy and paste in textFields and textAreas in my application. But I came to know that Appcelerator does not provide this functionality. Moreover, I could not find a native module to do so.

I believe, this is a very important and useful functionality in terms of security.

There is already a ticket created requesting to add this functionality for text area *TIMOB-15637*. Please have a look.

Thank you.
