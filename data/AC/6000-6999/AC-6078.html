<h3>Description</h3>

I've experienced issues with sending push notifications on other application, so I've created test-app with only push notifications functionality.

I've set up everything according to guide, added my ios certificates in Mobile Backend Services (both dev and prod), tried to send push notification and it is displayed in push notifications logs, but device doesn't show anything, even thought in application logs it's written that it successfully subscribed to push notification and I can see device and it's token in "Devices tab" in admin panel (Mobile Backend Services).

What could be the reason and how can I debug this issue?

(in attachment I've removed keys from tiapp.xml, but I can provide you with it if needed)

Thank you!

   Hello,
   
   Thanks for reporting this. Can you please update your cli and SDK version to the latest
   *appc use latest*
   *appc ti sdk install 7.5.0.GA*
   
   After upgrading please the test again and let us know how it goes. It would be better if you can share the dashboard push failure logs.</li>
<li>Petr Malakhaltsev 2018-12-24

   Done, rebuilt with 7.5.0.GA - same result.
   
   The "problem" is that there are no failure logs in dashboard. Please find attached screens.

   This is not an arrow issue but a misconfigured provisioning profile / app-id. If you get a device-id but the message does not arrive, this is always the reason for these kind of issue. Validate your setup and it should be fixed, good luck!</li>
