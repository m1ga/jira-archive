		"description": "When uploading a large file or multiple small files at the same time the ram usage on iOS will sky rocket and is not always garbage collected after the upload is finished or stopped. \r\n\r\nA upload of 100 MB can cause well over 400 MB of ram usage. Repeated uploads will cause the app to crash because it will not be garbage collected always. Multiple small uploads will cause the same issue to happen. \r\n\r\nOn older devices this is a bigger problem because of only having 1 or 2 GB of ram. But with larger file sizes even on newer devices this is a high amount of ram usage for an app. Having jscore set to false in the tiapp.xml seems to make it work better but its still not perfect. \r\n\r\nWhen you start an upload the file is immediately put into ram instead of being read off the disk, when the file is in ram it uses much more ram than the size of the file itself. I do not think the file should be put into ram if that was not done we would avoid this issue altogether. \r\n",
