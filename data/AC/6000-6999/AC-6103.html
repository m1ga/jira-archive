   Hello ,
   Thanks for sharing with us. Would you mind providing more information for the issues you are experiencing? For example is this something previously working?</li>
<li>johns@cim-rf.com 2019-01-15

   Hi, Appcelerator Studio was working fine.  Then it just stopped.  I did not install anything new.  The PC was simply logged off and turned off as always.  The next time, I started the PC, I could see in the dashboard that "IOS & Xcode Download was enabled".  This was a red flag.  Then I went to the Preferences\Studio\Platforms\IOS" and immediately displays error "An internal error occurred during: "Loading Certificates....".   
   Now if I run the at command line APPC and try to build application it works fine.  Help!!!

   Hello, DId you recently updated the Xcode? If so, Try opening the program once to finish the installation process. After that restart Appcelerator studio to see if there is any change? if not, send the "appc ti setup check" log in here. Thanks.</li>

   Hi, No I did not update Xcode.  Have started XCODE manually several times and restarted Studio, but same issue:

   Thanks for your feedback. Can you try to open a terminal window and execute the following command:
   *sudo xcode-select -switch <xcode_folder_path>*
   You may need to restart Studio for your changes to take effect.
   
   For details please visit the [link](<a href="https://docs.axway.com/bundle/Appcelerator_Studio_allOS_en/page/configuring_xcode_inside_studio.html)." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://docs.axway.com/bundle/Appcelerator_Studio_allOS_en/page/configuring_xcode_inside_studio.html).</a>
   
   Hope this helps.</li>
<li>johns@cim-rf.com 2019-01-16

   I tried following:
   
   sudo xcode-select -switch  /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
   
   Restarted studio and same issue.  Refer to previous screen shot, it is exactly showing loading certificates errors.
   </li>
<li>johns@cim-rf.com 2019-01-16

   If I run using APPC it builds fine:
   $ appc run -p ios -T dist-adhoc -s 7.2.0.GA
   Why does APPC work and studio does not?</li>
<li>Sharif AbuDarda 2019-01-16

   Hello, Please do the following, 
   
   1.  Make sure the Titanium SDK path is selected in the Preferences > Studio > Platforms?
   2. Try to check your iOS developer certificates are valid and try reinstalling. 
   3. Send the Help > Studio > Run Diagnostic Test log in here. Thanks.</li>
<li>johns@cim-rf.com 2019-01-16

   In Platforms  the titanium SDK Home: /Users/johnsuarez/Library/Application Support/Titanium
   
   The certificates are fine.  I can build the application using APPC with no issues.
   
   It looks like Studio is the one having some corrupt issues.  For example: I go to "Help/Studio/Run Diagnostic Test".  I get an error,
   "AN internal error occurred during: "Getting Diagnostic Logs".
   
   I have even tried downloading studio and installing again and it did not fix this.  It is some config file or other internal file that is not overwritten by installation that is causing this.

    Hello [~johns@cim-rf.com],
    Thanks for your feedback. What's your current Appcelerator studio version?</li>

    Hello [~johns@cim-rf.com],
    
    
    We haven't heard back from you since our last response. I thought I’d check in to see how things are progressing with your need.

    Hi,
    We have following version installed:
    
      Axway Appcelerator Studio	5.1.1.201809051655	appcelerator.studio	null
    
    That is the version we have been running all the time in above tests.</li>
<li>Sharif AbuDarda 2019-01-26

    Hello [~johns@cim-rf.com], As I said before we are planning for a fix in the 6.0.0 release. There is no ETA on the release right now. Try with a lower version of 5.1.1 for your build now. Thanks.</li>
<li>Rakhi Mitro 2019-01-29

    Hello,
    
    We haven't heard back from you since our last response. I am just following up to check the status of this case and if you need further help on it. </li>
