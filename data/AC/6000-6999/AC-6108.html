<h3>Description</h3>

With data binding if you close a view from the controller with a Ti.UI.Animation parameter and have called $.destroy() in the same close function, the animation runs first causing binding events to fire, effective making $.destroy useless in this context. Without an animation parameter $.destroy works as intended.

To remedy I have placed a $.removeListener() call before the $.getView().close(Ti.UI.createAnimation({})) call.

It might be a good idea to pop this in the docs as it's not *really* a bug.

   Hello [~nickkemp], Can you share a sample core that demonstrates the behavior? Please send the standalone sample code and steps to reproduce the issue. Thanks.</li>

   Hello [~nickkemp], 
   
   We haven't heard back from you since our last response. I thought I’d check in to see how things are progressing on your end. Did you manage to create sample a test project? 
   
   Have a great day.

   Hi Rakhi,
   
   I have created a test case, but couldn't reproduce. I think it maybe related to alloyXL.js. My current thinking is that due to the event binding in alloyXL, the js call stack is different causing the behaviour I'm seeing. I will continue to look at it, but it seems it's something for the alloyXL not you guys.
   
   Cheers,</li>
