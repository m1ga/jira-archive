<h3>Description</h3>

I while I can set breakpoints in Studio they are ignored when launch in debug mode. The debugger keyword is also ignored and does not cause an error.

I am using the currently latest version 5.1.1 with Ti SDK 7.5.0.GA against iPhone X Simulator using iOS 12.1. I've selected Debug mode, targeting iPhone X Simulator. I have not tried this with Android.

I've tried my own apps and new Classic as well as new Alloy projects as well as Kitchen sink.

I did not find any CLI options that would yield a different result. How can one troubleshoot if the issue is Studio or CLI?

This issue is [also posted on Stack Overflow](<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54173526/breakpoints-are-ignored-in-appcelerator-studio-5-5-1-x-in-debug-mode)." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54173526/breakpoints-are-ignored-in-appcelerator-studio-5-5-1-x-in-debug-mode).</a>

The Studio log file is attached. Trying to generate the Studio daemon log resulted in the following message: "Unable to generate Appc Daemon dump file, maybe due to appc daemon is not running or not available". 

P.S.: This JIRA does not list the latest version of Studio as an option.

   Hello, Please share a sample test project with breakpoints for us to test. Also, provide full steps for successful regeneration. Thanks.</li>
<li>chrishaff@gmail.com 2019-01-22

   In Studio:
   <h4>File > New > Mobile App Project</h4>
   <h4>Select Classic > Default Project</h4>
   <h4>Fill in text fields, select Ti SDK 7.5.0.GA, select iPad & iPhone deploy targets, disable Axway Platform Services</h4>
   <h4>Click Finish</h4>
   
   One the project is created:
   <h4>Open the new project, then Resources > app.js</h4>
   <h4>Put a breakpoint anywhere (I tried line 15 ??tabGround.open();?? and line 25)</h4>
   <h4>Select Debug, then iPhone X (v12.1)</h4>
   <h4>Your build will start, launch in sim and execute without stopping for any breakpoints </h4>
   
   This is a ZIP of the project it is unmodified from the template. It was created using the Export command in Studio.  I don't believe that breakpoints are in this archive, but you may know where they hide...
   [^ClassicDefault.zip] 
   
   I've implied all of this information in the original writeup. Are you asking for something else?

   [~chrishaff@gmail.com],
   Thanks for your feedback. This is a known issue. I would like to inform you that engineering has confirmed that issue is scheduled for Studio Release 6.0.0. Don't have any ETA now.
   
   Thanks</li>
<li>chrishaff@gmail.com 2019-01-23

   Oy!  I will try uninstalling Studio 5.1.1 and install 5.0. Hopefully that gets me back to work.
   
   Could you confirm which sub component (Studio, CLI, something else) the issue lies with? </li>
<li>Sharif AbuDarda 2019-01-23

   Hello [~chrishaff@gmail.com], Try with the 5.0 version. This issue is only a studio bug. Should be fixed in 6.0.0 release. Thanks.</li>
<li>chrishaff@gmail.com 2019-01-23

   Thanks for confirming.  
   
   I just tried installing 5.0. after deleting the 5.1.1 install. The install appeared to go fine, but when I launch it brings up the "Select a workspace" dialog *where it hangs*.  I can't Browse, Cancel or click OK.  *All I can do it Force Quit.*
   
   When I run <code>appc info</code> every thing reports as OK.  I do note that I am running the latest version of the CLIs (see below).  Could those be the issues.  Do I need to revert one/all of those to match?

   Is there a way to use Chrome dev tools or something else to debug like you can with node and NativeScript? Please let me know.
   
   I've only tried this with iOS.  Will the debugger work with Android?
   
   You said this was a know issue.  What's the URL for that (TISTUD) ticket?
   
   I went back to Studio 5.0.0 which did launch once I installed JDK 1.8.131. I had to remove 1.8.0_181. *The debugger still does not work.*
   
   I ran the below which pointed out that there is a newer Ti CLI. Updating it using <code>sudo npm update -g titanium</code> resulted in no change...?
