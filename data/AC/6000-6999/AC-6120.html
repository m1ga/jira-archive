<h3>Description</h3>

The following project show that a window freshly opened into a NavWin will be close by a code that says to close a previously opened window.

<a href="https://github.com/guiled/appctest" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/guiled/appctest</a>

How to test it :
- you start on window "A"
- click on "Open B" button, that will open the window "B"
- click on "Open C with delayed closing B", that will open the window "C" and then close the window "B" after 300ms. And everything happens as expected.
- click on "Close C" to go back to window "A" as expected.
- then click "Open B" button,
- and click on "Open C without delayed closing B". That will open the window "C" and immediately close the window "C" ( ! ! ). That is absolutely unexpected. Window "C" seems not to be opened, window "B" is still here.

We shouldn't have to use a timeout to run this code that closes Window "B" just after opening window "C"
