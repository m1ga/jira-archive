   This is not a bug and was made this way on purpose.
   
   In Titanium 8.0.0, Android's <code>TabGroup</code> has been completely rewritten to use Google's newest native tab classes. Our old implementation displayed tabs in the <code>ActionBar</code> and has been deprecated by Google.
   
   The benefits of this change is that you can now use a "NoTitleBar" theme. You weren't able to do this before since tabs used to be embedded within it. The other benefit of our <code>TabGroup</code> rewrite is that Android now supports a "bottom" tab style similar to iOS.
   
   The negative is that the top tab bar style will appear below the <code>ActionBar</code> when landscape (as you've noted) since they're no longer embedded within the <code>ActionBar</code>. If you don't like this behavior, then I recommend that you use the "NoTitleBar" theme instead... which is how it's normally displayed in iOS as well.

   Hello [~andreas.pingas], I tried to test the issue on the ticket above, I was able to reproduce it on a device (Nokia 6 Android 8.1.0). I am testing with the SDK 8.0.0.v20190219113758. launching a TabGroup in "portrait" form, In landscape mode tabs are resized and when going back to portrait mode the tabs stretch to fit the window. But, launching a TabGroup in "landscape" form, In portrait mode, the tabs won't resize to fill the window. Thanks.</li>

   bq. Also, TabGroup with bottom style, is it obligatory to have title at tabs?
   
   You do not have to set a title, but it'll still render a small empty space where the title would normally be. This is a feature that Google has added fairly recently (support library v28) which we haven't upgraded to yet (Titanium is using v27). So, this is a thing we can do in the future once [TIMOB-26262] is done.</li>
