<h3>Description</h3>

 I have one classic appcelerator project with some of module used into that.

But yesteday, I have just updated sdk to 7.5.1.GA, build project with 7.5.1.GA Sdk, it throwing me below error - dexer error (may be due to jar get conflicting in diff modules)

later I have run my same project with with 7.5.0.GA still it throwing same error. But previosuly it was working fine with sdk 7.5.0.GA, now it is not working from yesterdays update.

   The issue because of ti.playservices module was updated in SDK 7.5.1 GA and some modules depending on ti.playservices should rebuild again with the new version 16.1.2.
   
   To fix this try to add ti.playservices module and roll back to version 11.0.40.</li>
