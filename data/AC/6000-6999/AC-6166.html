<h3>Description</h3>

Sending a push notification via the cloud api is failing with the error "Exception Type: General; Error Code: 1005; Error Message: There is no corresponding subscriptions and no need to send push".
This is incorrect as there are devices subscribed.
Further more, sending the push manually in the axway console is sending the notification correctly (same channel and same payload.

There is one android device registered which receives the  notifications sent through the console, but not via the api

   Hello,
   
   Thanks for sharing this. Do the following and let us know the results.
   1. Please uninstall the app from the device
   2. Re register it with the push and build again with latest SDK</li>

   Hello, Are you using a custom server for sending push notification? as you said using Axway dashboard console sends the notification correctly. I believe the issues are with your custom server. Make sure the device is registered there. Thanks.</li>

   I ended up setting up and registering an iOS device as well and suddenly the android notifications were coming through.
   
   The custom server is just calling the Axway api directly so it's not the issue (and I could replicate calling the api manually via curl).
   
   From what I can see it was failing (from the api) if there was only 1 device registered, but was working correctly from Axway Dashboard.
   
   It's working now so I'll close it off</li>
</ol>
