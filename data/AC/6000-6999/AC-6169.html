<h3>Description</h3>

Hello,

In my app, i'm including a module which contains .aar library which herself contains .so libraries in /jni/armeabi-v7a folder.
My problem is that when i compile my module, the .so libraries are not copied in the resulting .zip file of the module (in the libs folder), and of course app crashes when launched.
I thought it was a problem of folder naming beaucse initially my .so files was on armeabi folder and i saw that its deprecated and we can't use armeabi anymore, so i renamed armeabi to armeabi-v7a in my library and recompiled the .aar, included it in my project, recompiled the module but libs are still not present.

Do you have an idea of what is going wrong ?
Thanks in advance

EDIT : I forgot to mention that i already included in my manifest file the following line : 
architectures: arm64-v8a armeabi-v7a x86

   Hi Rakhi,
   For those who encounter the same issue, i resolved the problem (after seeing Titanium SDK source code) :
   The problem was that on my .aar i had only a /jni/armeabi-v7a folder but (i guess because i have 3 architectures : arm64-v8a armeabi-v7a x86, in the manifest of my module) Titanium SDK was throwing an Exception if one of the folder was not found. So .so files was not copied after SDK didn't found first folder (arm64-v8a).
   
   Hope it can help someone else</li>
