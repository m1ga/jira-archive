   Thanks.
   
   I see 2 issues:
   
   1) Android closes Wifi/Mobile connection depending on battery charge status. For this I made Ti.AudioNotification.
   2) Android closes apps (unrelated to online stuff). For this I made Ti.Powermanager, on some devices it works. On my Nokia8 it doesn't work

   For requesting the BatterySafingPermission I have build this module: <a href="https://github.com/AppWerft/Ti.PowerManager" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/AppWerft/Ti.PowerManager</a>
   Additional an evil watchdog: <a href="https://github.com/AppWerft/Ti.Watchdog" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/AppWerft/Ti.Watchdog</a>
   
   Currently I'm testing the Watchdog solution. This module starts an Alarmmanager.</li>

   Hello [~titanium@webmasterei-hamburg.de], can you get back to us on the status of your issue? The other issue is fixed in the 8.0.2 release, can you try with the master release of 8.0.2 sdk and let us know? Thanks.</li>
<li>Rainer Schleevoigt 2019-06-11

   I have tersted witg 8.0.1 and 8.1.0, in both cases the issue is partly solved, will test with 8.0.2.
   
   Partly solved means:
   If I force the restart by dev option, then I see short a gray screen under colored toolbar. 
   Without this debug option it partly runs in the case above, but after sleeping overnight amnd restarting the screen I see the old issue (only standard gray window). Th only exit is to swipe out...
   
   As mentioned I will test with 8.0.2. Feedback later., </li>
