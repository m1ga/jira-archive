					"body": "Hey Joshua, we don't have permission to view that comment.  We're seeing these performance issues with a single SQL statement, not multiple statements.  Also, SQLCipher should implicitly create transactions, however we've also attempted to use explicit BEGIN/COMMIT statements to manage the transactions ourselves and see no difference in performance for the use case stated in this JIRA.  We're seeing a significant discrepancy between the EncryptedDB module and the native Ti.Database module with identical schemas and queries.  I understand encryption adds overhead, however even if we use the module without an encryption key in a non-encrypted manner we are still seeing the performance issues.  I also understand that Ti.Database uses the system's native SQLite library, but we don't understand why the discrepancy would be this dramatic.",

					"body": "Oh shoot. I didn't realize I was linking to a private ticket. Here's a copy and paste of some of the key comments below.\r\n\r\nbq. We use the SQLCipher library to implement encrypted SQLite database support on Android and iOS. They provide the following guidance in improving performance...\r\nhttps://discuss.zetetic.net/t/sqlcipher-performance/14\r\nbq. So, transactions should be used when doing multiple INSERTs and UPDATEs as a single batch. And you should be using indexes to reduce the SELECT, INSER, and UPDATE execution times as well. Also, opening the database file is expensive as well and you should leave it open if you are actively using it. Don't open and close it per database transaction.\r\nbq. Note that execution times on Android are going to be a bit slower compared to iOS because there is \"language-interop\" involved. On iOS, the JavaScript, SQLite, and encryption APIs are all implemented in C, so there is no language interop or extra string copies that need to happen. On Android, there's additional overhead with copying the JavaScript C/C++ strings to/from Java strings (involves transcoding to/from UTF-8 and UTF-16 too).\r\n\r\n[~ryan@mvretail.com], below is the code I use to demo the performance differences between {{Ti.Database}} and {{appcelerator.encrypteddatabase}} with and without transaction. The setting the top 2 variables {{isEncrypted}} and {{useTransactions}} to {{true}}/{{false}} allows you to see the performance differences. The \"BEGIN TRANSACTION\"/\"COMMIT\" does significantly improve the performance. You should also keep the database connection open, because opening/closing the database file has significant overhead as well.\r\n{code:javascript}\r\nvar isEncrypted = true;\r\nvar useTransactions = true;\r\nvar database = isEncrypted ? require(\"appcelerator.encrypteddatabase\") : Ti.Database;\r\nif (isEncrypted) {\r\n\tdatabase.setPassword(\"password\");\r\n}\r\n\r\nvar dbConnection = null;\r\ntry {\r\n\t// Open the database file.\r\n\tvar dbName = isEncrypted ? \"test_encrypted.db\" : \"test.db\";\r\n\tdbConnection = database.open(dbName);\r\n\r\n\t// Drop the table created below if we're re-running the app.\r\n\tdbConnection.execute(\"DROP TABLE IF EXISTS test;\");\r\n\r\n\t// Create the database table.\r\n\tif (useTransactions) {\r\n\t\tdbConnection.execute(\"BEGIN TRANSACTION;\");\r\n\t}\r\n\tdbConnection.execute(\"CREATE TABLE test(id integer PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT);\");\r\n\tdbConnection.execute(\"CREATE INDEX test_name ON test(name);\");\r\n\tif (useTransactions) {\r\n\t\tdbConnection.execute(\"COMMIT;\");\r\n\t}\r\n\t\r\n\t// Insert rows and measure performance.\r\n\tTi.API.info(\"@@@ DB inserts started.\");\r\n\tvar startTime = new Date();\r\n\tif (useTransactions) {\r\n\t\tdbConnection.execute(\"BEGIN TRANSACTION;\");\r\n\t}\r\n\tfor (var index = 1; index <= 1000; index++) {\r\n\t\tdbConnection.execute(\"INSERT INTO test(name) VALUES ('Row \" + index + \"');\");\r\n\t}\r\n\tif (useTransactions) {\r\n\t\tdbConnection.execute(\"COMMIT;\");\r\n\t}\r\n\tTi.API.info(\"@@@ DB insert duration: \" + (new Date() - startTime) + \" ms\");\r\n} catch (err) {\r\n\t// Database error occurred.\r\n\talert(err);\r\n\tTi.API.error(err);\r\n} finally {\r\n\t// Close the database.\r\n\tif (dbConnection) {\r\n\t\ttry {\r\n\t\t\tdbConnection.close();\r\n\t\t} catch (err) {\r\n\t\t\talert(err);\r\n\t\t\tTi.API.error(err);\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\tdbConnection = null;\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n{code}\r\n",

					"body": "[~ryan@mvretail.com], then the performance bottleneck you are most likely running into is the transcoding of your very large SQL string to/from UTF-8/UTF-16. Because this involves transcoding the JavaScript UTF-8 string to a Java UTF-16 string, which is then passed to the \"SQLCipher\" library, which in the end will be transcoded back to UTF-8 when sent to the C/C++ to be written to the database.\r\n\r\nWith the code I posted above, doing 1000 separate inserts with \"transactions\" is pretty reasonable between the encrypted and unencrypted database modules. The average times for me on a physical Pixel 2 device are:\r\n* {{appcelerator.encrypteddatabase}}: 102 ms\r\n* {{Ti.Database}}: 42 ms\r\n\r\nI suggest that you do the same and split your giant INSERT SQL string into separate INSERT strings surrounded by a begin/end transaction call. This is proven to be far more efficient.",

I ran your code on a Nexus 4 with Android 6 (one of the environments I described as having this problem) and the results were:\r\n\r\n* appcelerator.encrypteddatabase: @@@ DB insert duration: 9604 ms\r\n* Ti.Database: @@@ DB insert duration: 130 ms\r\n\r\nAnd when I increased the row size to 10000 like in my sample project, I got the following results:\r\n\r\n* appcelerator.encrypteddatabase: @@@ DB insert duration: 104572 ms\r\n* Ti.Database:@@@ DB insert duration: 1070 ms\r\n\r\nThis shows the problem exists still even with your suggestions. As I stated in the original bug report, this isn't happening on all android devices. Even the large batch inserts on my sample projects are fast on most devices with android 8 and above. While your suggestions on optimization are helpful, they are no match for the issue on these environments. Could you please investigate why it is so slow on the devices and android versions specified?",
