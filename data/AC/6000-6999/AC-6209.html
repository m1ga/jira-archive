<h3>Description</h3>

I have an app with arrowdb events.
When I tried to query the occurrences, API calls gives 500 error. It was working sometime earlier but seems to be stopped working recently.

Below is a sample calls. 
<a href="https://api.cloud.appcelerator.com/v1/events/show/occurrences.json?key=xxxx&pretty_json=true&event_id=xx&response_depth=2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://api.cloud.appcelerator.com/v1/events/show/occurrences.json?key=xxxx&pretty_json=true&event_id=xx&response_depth=2</a>

Response: 500 Internal Server Error

How could I resolve this issue? I have my application live and I am using Indie plan. Do I need to purchase a pro plan and contact support?

   Hello, Can you share the full REST API command you are running? There seems to be an issue with the oauth key. Thanks.</li>

   I have contacted direct support from my project's pro account and the issue has been fixed. I think that the ticket was a private ticket, so cannot be linked here.
   
   I am not sure if the fix was global or to a particular environment.
