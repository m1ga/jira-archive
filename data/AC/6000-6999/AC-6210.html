<h3>Description</h3>

I'm getting these errors from ti.cloudpush:

* Device token is null
* Getting GCM SenderId failed

I have triple checked the Sender ID that I got from Firebase is correct. I added it to my tiapp.xml as follows:


<property name="gcm.senderid">407945964413</property>

   I was wondering if the Appc App ID  or GUID would have anything to do with it? I noticed those both have changed at some point and I'm not sure when they changed or why they changed. I've taken so many steps figuring things out along the way I forget what is what sometimes</li>

   I've tried using ti.goosh and it successfully retrieves the device token.</li>

   So now, as a hack, I've used ti.goosh to retrieve the device token and sending it to the <code>Cloud.PushNotifications.subscribeToken</code> it returns error message:
   
   Error:
   [INFO] :   Android application package not configured</li>

   Hello, The issue with ti.cloudpush is only with the latest version? Can you try with a lower version or the previous version? Let us know. Thanks.</li>

   Hi,
   
   Sorry, I forgot to update here when I fixed it. 
   
   The problem was with my App ID and Oauth details in my tiapp.xml file. When I took over the project I moved it to a different organisation and those details got mixed up somehow. 
   
   Thank you for your response. You can close this ticket.</li>
