<h3>Description</h3>

Hi guys,

I was going to release a new version of some of our apps when I found that the previous ti.touchid module was deprecated. I quickly found the ti.identity module and I downloaded version 1.0.4 and 1.0.6. I added it to my projects and the app seemed to be crashing all the time I was trying to invoke the authentication.

For the sake of testing, I created a brand new project, using just the example of the module itself and nothing more.

The result is that as soon as I try to use FaceID both in emulator and in a real device the app just crashes without showing any information in the log.

This would be easy to check: just create a project with the app.js of the example in the ti.identity module.

If you need more detailed information, could you please let me know how to get it?

Thanks in advance!


PS: Same module tested in non FaceID devices such as iPhone 7, works with TouchID.

   Please read the documentation carefully. You need the  <code>NSFaceIDUsageDescription</code> flag in the plist section of your tiapp.xml, e.g.:
   <code><pre>
   &lt;key&gt;NSFaceIDUsageDescription&lt;/key&gt;
   &lt;string&gt;Why you need Face ID.&lt;/string&gt;
   </pre></code></li>

   Hi Hans,
   
   As usual you got the right answer. I added this key to the tiapp.xml in the past, but I commented it out for testing and never reverted it back. Uncommenting it again, did the job.
   
   Many thanks for your help. You can close this issue.</li>
