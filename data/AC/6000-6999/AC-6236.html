<h3>Description</h3>

I am able to build and run my app via appcelerator. But I have to now generate the iPA and for that I am opening the app's xcode project in xcode and then generating the iPA after archiving it. 

But when I run the iPA on device, I get the following error:

Couldn't find module: lib/format for architecture: arm64

Please suggest as to how I can fix it.
