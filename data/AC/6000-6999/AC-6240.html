<h3>Description</h3>

App fails to run with following error :  

[INFO] :   MultiDex: VM has multidex support, MultiDex support library is disabled.
[DEBUG] :  APSAnalytics: APSAnalytics initialization started...
[ERROR] :  Security: (AsyncTask #1) [77,77] Error performing security checks: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Failed resolution of: Lorg/apache/http/client/methods/HttpGet;
[ERROR] :  Security: (main) [0,77] Security exception encountered. Waiting for root activity to show error.

This is working on titanium SDK 7.4.2.GA but as we changed the SDK to 7.5.2.GA it's not working.

   [~prashantj],
   Thanks for reporting this. We are already working on this. The
   engineering has confirmed that issue is scheduled for CLI Release 7.1.0.</li>
<li>Prashant 2019-05-08

   Hi Rakhi,
   
   Can you please confirm the scheduled date for CLI release 7.1.0. </li>
<li>Rakhi Mitro 2019-05-08

   
   [~prashantj],
   Shared the query with our engineering team. Will be back here after getting any feedback from them.</li>

   This is a known issue. Please see: [CLI-1343]
   
   The plan is to solve this via our CLI (ie: our "appc" command line tool) in the near future. Unfortunately, we don't have an ETA yet. So, the only work-around is to build with Titanium 7.4.x for the moment.
   
   I'm going to close this ticket as a duplicate. I recommend that you follow the above ticket I mentioned. That way you'll be notified when the issue has been resolved. I apologize for the inconvenience.</li>

   [~prashantj], I'm not sure I understand what your issue is with Google Cloud Speech. It doesn't sound related to this ticket's issue... other than you want to upgrade to the newest Titanium version. (The other ticket you are referencing would cause a build failure, not a runtime error.)
   
   Are you able to use the Google Cloud Speech API when you remove the <code>"appc-sourcecode-encryption-policy"</code> property from your "tiapp.xml" file?</li>
<li>Prashant 2019-05-17

    Google Cloud APIs are working fine on SDK v7.5.2.GA (when we remove the "appc-sourcecode-encryption-policy" property from our "tiapp.xml" file), But we can’t go ahead without "appc-sourcecode-encryption-policy" property. The app is failed to run/ build on SDK v7.4.2 after adding dependency JARs needed for google cloud speech recognition. So we are blocked now. 
   
   We can have a call if you need more details regarding this. </li>
