<h3>Description</h3>

Hi All, 

I am facing one issue after integrating the module which contains the framework. The application is working perfectly fine while running it on Simulator but we are getting the following error while doing the ad-hoc distribution. 

I have created the framework  and Appcelerator module framework on the same machine

[INFO]  Invoking xcodebuild
[ERROR] ** ARCHIVE FAILED **
[ERROR] The following build commands failed:

   Hello, Make sure you have a valid provision profile. Try creating a new one and then try packaging. Also, were your app thinning enabled in the app? Try disabling it and try packaging. Let us know the update of the issue. Thanks.</li>
