<h3>Description</h3>

Hi,

I am trying to get crash reporting working, and I was told that the com.appcelerator.aca module should load when using appc new, or the appc cli will check once per day.

I've enabled services on a new and current project as instructed in the docs, im using the cli all day, and have tried appc new, but nothing seems to be pulling the module down.  Is the module available for download via github somewhere?

Thanks!

   Hello, DId you follow the guide in here <a href="https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides2/AMPLIFY+Crash+Analytics" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides2/AMPLIFY+Crash+Analytics</a> ? Make sure you have the SDK 8.0.0.GA and selected when you create the new project. Thanks.</li>

   Hi Sharif,
   
   As far as I can see I do have 8.0.0.GA selected.  However I did have to reinstall titanium and studio recently, so my ti.config might not be correct.  Maybe I dont have something set here?

   Sharif,
   
   So Im not 100% sure this was happening when I opened the ticket, but I went to try again with the intent to send you any logs.  would not being able to register the app with aapc platform cause any issues with downloading the module?

    Hi,
    
    That link says nothing about the subscription level or the price.  its very misleading.  I was spinning my wheels for 4 days trying to figure out what the issue was, and nobody was able to give me a straight answer.  Very frustrating, to say the least.
    
    On a lighter note, I did get the module to finally download, and was testing with a test app (IOS).  I was seeing exceptions and logging breadcrumbs, using the documentation's code here.  the crashes were appearing in my dashboard within seconds.  
    
    <a href="https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides2/AMPLIFY+Crash+Analytics" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides2/AMPLIFY+Crash+Analytics</a>
    
    I believe after a crash you have to restart the app for the crash to report to the dashboard, but I can't confirm this.  If you can confirm this for me I would appreciate it.
    
    I then applied the code to my real app, and I am now not able to see any crash logs in ANY of the apps of my app dashboard, this includes my test app that I was seeing logs in before.
    
    The ids of the apps so that you can see my logging in the dashboard are:
    test app: 5ce3037a5698dc5dcb5551bb
    real app: 569fcda71c22964945089614
    
    Is there a reason why I might not be able to see crash logs after applying the module to my real app?  I've attached the test app's build logs as trace for your reference.  There should be a number of logs reported for yesterday and today in both apps, and I'm not seeing anything.
    
    update: Android seems to be reporting OK at the moment.  The issue is only with iOS.

    [~capsizeno4] I can see your iOS crashes in your real app, but the correct time period needs to be selected.
     !Screen Shot 2019-05-22 at 4.53.29 PM.png|thumbnail!
    
    _Last 60 minutes_ will show crashes that have occurred in the past 60 minutes. Where _Last 24 hours_ will show crashes that have occured in the past 24 hours *PRIOR* to the current hour.</li>
