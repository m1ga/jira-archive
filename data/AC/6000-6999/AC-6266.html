   Hello [~nagaharish], can you please provide a sample project that is able to reproduce the issue in adhoc build? Thanks</li>
<li>Naga harish M 2019-05-25

   Yes with adhoc and running device. Unfortunately, with the sample I can reproduce this issue. As I said few JS files are still working and not compile as alloy js files. If I creating sample project it is working well.
   
   There are many issues with the latest version of SDK it seems. I am unable to show PDF from the document in a web view in iOS.
   
   If required we will agree for screen share I will show what is the issue. Unfortunately, I can't share the code. We have a subscription is there any support from appc? For subscription partners?
   
   Thank you,
   Harish.

   Thank you @Hans, I think pointed issue is related. I also done some R&D with build folder I can see there is some difference in index.json when build with 7.5.1 and 8.0.  We have different workaround for now.
   
   I am copying my assets files manually to iPA and resign them again works fine.
   
   It is not a blocker for us but don't some extra steps do not look right. If it can be fixed in next release it will be very helpful to all.</li>
