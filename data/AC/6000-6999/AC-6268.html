<h3>Description</h3>

We identified an issue in our project with iOS, when we minimize and maximize (2-4 times) app is crashing even in a simulator.  Crash report pointing to main.m line number - 66.

Then we tried with creating a sample project and run with 7.5.1. Repeated same steps it worked well. When we changed to 8.0 and 8.0.1 it was crashing.

I am not providing any sample here because creating fresh new alloy app itself crashing.

Thank you.

   @Vijay thank you we are working with 7.5.+ for now and release this version. It was delayed because of WKWEBVIEW changes. I am happy to close this issue if we already have another ticket (TIMOB-27049).</li>
