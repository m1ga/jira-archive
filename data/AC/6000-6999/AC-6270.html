<h3>Description</h3>

We use the ti.detect code found here <a href="https://github.com/Topener/ti.detect/blob/master/ti.detect.js" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/Topener/ti.detect/blob/master/ti.detect.js</a> to determine if an iOS device has a notch so we can space things accordingly at the top of the screen.  This works great across all simulators including the iPhone XR.  But on an actual XR device it's not working.  We have received many complaints about this from our iPhone XR users.  Something in the Titanium framework is probably failing since it works fine in the XR simulator but not on device.  Unfortunately we don't own an iPhone XR so we cannot debug it :) 
 We think it must have something to do with the Ti.Platform.displayCaps not being set correctly on an XR device.

   Hi! Closing the ticket here as this is a ti.detect shortcoming as the xr resolution is different and not handled there yet.
