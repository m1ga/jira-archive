   Hi [~gtassistro],
   Did you try to configure iOS sdk via studio preference? Navigate to Axway Appcelerator Studio > Preferences > Platforms > iOS >  click refresh
   
   Restart studio and try to build project with this command : appc run -p ios -T simulator -l trace
   Let me know the update after this.</li>
<li>Giorgio Tassistro 2019-06-03

   Hi Jebun,
   for iOS Refresh (i make a lot of time) .. but does'nt work.
   
   *But Wow! If use appc run -p ios -T simulator -l trace -d <my directory>, works!!*
   Do you still need the log?
   
   I often feel that appc contains information other than Axway Studio.
   
   The problem using run in Axway Studio remains, what should I do now?
   
   Thanks</li>
<li>Jebun Naher 2019-06-03

   [~gtassistro] can you restart your system and check if you still experience the same?</li>
<li>Giorgio Tassistro 2019-06-03

   Yes,
   it's the same.

   Jebun,
   I attach now a screenshot (Schermata_...) where you can see in Axway Studio "SDK ad profile missing" and i appc there is all.
   
   An little information for you:
   Yesterday , I tried to change permissions in "workarea directory" (including directory .metadata) with 777 for use all with a other user (same Mac)
   This is because I have to publish a App with other provisioning profiles and Studio show me only (certified) of first Apple ID user of Xcode and not other. 
   I therefore have two users on the mac each with his certificates. 
   It seemed to work but I had a permission error in publication ! See ACC-6274
   But this is another problem, but perhaps is linked to problem.

   Do you have multiple Xcode installed in your system? if So, To switch the Xcode version used by Studio: 
   
   Open a Terminal window and execute the following command: sudo xcode-select -switch <xcode_folder_path>
   
   The <xcode_folder_path> is typically /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
   
   In Studio, open the Studio Preferences and navigate to Studio > Platforms > iOS.
   In the iOS section, click the Refresh button.
   The newly specified Xcode folder path should be displayed. You may need to restart Studio for your changes to take effect. Thanks.</li>

   Ok, last night *I solved* it! .. but I don't know why ...
   
   I don't have multiple XCode installations.
   
   For steps.
   1. I had the same problem of [<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34228075/appcelerator-studio-does-not-recognize-xcode" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34228075/appcelerator-studio-does-not-recognize-xcode</a>](<a href="http://example.com)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://example.com)</a>
   2. The installation folder is ok as shown in the screenshot. I had already changed it with the "appc xcode-select" command
   3. I reinstalled node.js and reboot Mac. 
   4. I added the "node" app in "accessibility".
   *But Axway studio still didn't see Xcode*
   
   4. It still didn't work, so I decided to install the Android studio on the Mac to be able to use it.
   
   After installing Android Studio I opened Appcelerator Studio to see if Android was available.
   But with surprise... *not only was Android available, but also iOS!*
