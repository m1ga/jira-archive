<h3>Description</h3>

Regression since TIMOB-26399 iOS: Several issues with push-notifications since 7.3.x Fix

- silent notifications fire on the dedicated silent event AND the normal (pre-existing)
Seems to have regressed in 8_0_1_GA

On iOS: weâ€™re seeing the callback for <code>registerForPushNotifications</code> being called twice when the push notification has content-available set to 1. 

If we also register an event listener for <code>silentpush</code> this fires as well. 

The result is when in the foreground we end up getting three different events to process the same notification. When the app is backgrounded we get 1 event on silentpush and one on the <code>registerForPushNotifications</code> callback.

I have tested the same code on 7.5.2 and the behaviour is correct (1 event) with this SDK.

   Am I right in assuming that it's probably because we are using the callback property of registerForPushNotifications and so effectively "double registering" for events. I see in Han's example repo this is no longer used. If this is the case, the docs need an update to reflect the events have been split out!</li>

   [~nickkemp] Would it be possible to get a simple test case which reproduces the issue? Thanks. </li>
