<h3>Description</h3>

It would be great if we could add input filters to textfields to limit the input characters independently from the keyboard type. This could work on iOS with shouldChangeCharactersInRange and on Android with an input filter. The filter could accept a character sequence string so that it could work with i18n methods too. If the input was true/valid then fire a change event and all the other normal stuff.
