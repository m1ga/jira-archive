<h3>Description</h3>

When I run this

appc ti info -t ios

Here is my output

Copyright (c) 2014-2019, Appcelerator, Inc.  All Rights Reserved.

 Xcode 
   11.0 (build 11M382q) - Xcode default

    Teams                     =  none 
 
At the bottom I see this:

iOS Issues 
    !     Unable to find any valid iOS adhoc provisioning profiles.
     This will prevent you from packaging apps for adhoc distribution.
     You will need to log in to  <a href="http://appcelerator.com/ios-dist-certs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://appcelerator.com/ios-dist-certs</a>  with your Apple Developer
     account, then create, download, and install a profile.
 
    !     Xcode  11.0  may or may not work with Titanium SDK 8.1.0.
     The maximum supported Xcode version by Titanium SDK 8.1.0 is Xcode 10.x.


When I run this:  sudo xcode-select -p
I see this

/Applications/Xcode-beta.app/Contents/Developer


I also have the latest RC of the Studio....all seems to be installed properly...yet studio will not recognize anything.....

Help

   This is due to xcode 11 being new and we only started supporting it recently. Can you try SDK 8.2?
   
   And can you also run the latest CLI RC in combination with that?
   
   <code><pre>
   appc ti sdk install --branch master 8.2.0.v20190731191122
   [sudo] npm install -g appcelerator@4.2.14-3
   appc use 7.1.0-24
   </pre></code></li>

   Hello [~peterladis], Did you tried with the 8.2.x master releases? follow Rene's guide? Let us know if you still have the issue with the Xcode 11 beta version. Thanks.</li>

   I think this is caused by DAEMON-282/CLI-1363 we're currently planning to release an RC this week that will fix this. Note you can build from the CLI to an iOS 13 sim, this is just in the detection logic that powers Studio</li>

   Hello [~peterladis], Can you please follow up here? Are you able to run into iOS simulator through the terminal? Thanks.</li>
