   [~NewportSolutions], based off the line in the logs it seems to be pausing on, I think you're hitting TIMOB-27102. You can find the changes I made in the PR here <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/ioslib/pull/87" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/ioslib/pull/87</a>, if you open the file at <code>~/Library/Application Support/Titanium/mobilesdk/osx/7.5.1.GA/node_modules/ioslib/lib/sim_focus.scpt</code> you should be able to patch that file locally to prevent this</li>

   Did not help. In fact I have the same issue with 8.0.2 and 8.1 SDK's - which I verified have that fix included. The simulator opens quickly, then a longgggg time goes by, much more than 1 minute, at least 5 mins and then the app opens in the simulator. 
   I updated to xCode 10.3 just after updating the Studio, CLI, and SDK if that helps.</li>

   ....and now it's working fine. The only thing significant I can report is I did, app use 7.0.12 (which didn't help) so I changed it back using appc use 7.1.0 and there was also a "workspace rebuild" after that. I had restarted my machine twice today with no change so perhaps the workspace rebuild or toggling the CLI version. Fixed for now. </li>

   Awesome, glad you managed to fix it. I'll close this ticket out</li>
