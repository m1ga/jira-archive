<h3>Description</h3>

Currently we're dealing with some issues regarding opening apps using URL-scheme on Android.

In attachments, two apps which are both using URL-scheme to open each other. After closing the initial first screen of the first app, the app is always completely restarted after being opened again using URL-scheme. In the sample video, you can see that after the first screen is closed and opened again (0:18), followed by navigating to the second app and back to the first app, that the app is restarted ("First app on start from url", expected should be "First app on resume from url"). The app is not restarted if the initial screen has never been closed. (first part of the movie)

In a production app, we are using some encryption functionalities, and after the app restart, the dynamic encryption key is changed and invalid to decrypt information that comes from the second app. On iOS, it's functional as expected.
