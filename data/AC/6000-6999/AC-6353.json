This problem occurs with both iOS and Android.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.stubhub.com/cal-bears-football-tickets/performer/140/\r\n\r\nThe StubHub website recognizes the mobile platform and, after loading the mobile web page, it does a redirect to its url-scheme as you'll see in the log of load: and beforeload: events.  Prior to SDK 8, the redirect would fail transparently.  With SDK 8, we get very unusual behavior.  The normal mobile web page is loaded and displayed but then the stubhub:// url is loaded and we get a Webpage not available error.\r\n\r\nAndroid pops up an error alert and throws the error event.  iOS throws the error event.\r\n\r\nAndroid Log:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n[INFO] :   WebViewFactory: Loading com.android.chrome version 76.0.3809.132 (code 380913237)\r\n[WARN] :   W/m.phondini.tes: ClassLoaderContext classpath element mismatch for position 0. expected=base.apk!classes2.dex, found=/data/app/com.android.chrome-zuW0BDWT7wPtSsggEOsmwg==/base.apk!classes2.dex (PCL[base.apk*3474436943:base.apk!classes2.dex*1411187084] | PCL[/data/app/com.android.chrome-zuW0BDWT7wPtSsggEOsmwg==/base.apk*3474436943:/data/app/com.android.chrome-zuW0BDWT7wPtSsggEOsmwg==/base.apk!classes2.dex*1411187084])\r\n[INFO] :   cr_LibraryLoader: Time to load native libraries: 2 ms (timestamps 5053-5055)\r\n[INFO] :   chromium: [INFO:library_loader_hooks.cc(51)] Chromium logging enabled: level = 0, default verbosity = 0\r\n[INFO] :   InputMethodManager: startInputInner -
