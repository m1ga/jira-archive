   Hello,
   
   Thanks for reaching out to us. It would be great if you can attach a simple test project to reproduce the issue on our end. Can you please test it for a new project?</li>
<li>Luke Lu 2019-09-04

   @Rakhi Mitro yeah, that was the hard part, I cannot pinpoint an exact code that triggers the crash. For a new project, I cannot replicate that but tbh it won't be as complex as the current project.
   P.S. It was easier to find an issue on android, with ti-shadow I could use "Pause on exception" on Chrome dev tool. but it doesn't work on ios. Is there any similar way for ios?</li>
<li>Sharif AbuDarda 2019-09-18

   Hello, Can you share a trace log on the crash, Run the project in terminal mode with -l trace tag. And send the log here. Thanks.</li>
<li>Luke Lu 2019-09-19

   Sure, here is the log copied from the terminal (attached full). Let me know if it stored in any log file. Also attached build_iphone.log. 
   "[TRACE] Window is not open. Ignoring this close call" is normally around when the crash happens, is that anything? [^build_iphone.log]

   Hello [~luke_lu], It was found that when opening a second window within an app, calling the close() method will actually close both windows. I believe you are doing such a task in your app? This only occurs when <enable-launch-screen-storyboard> is set to TRUE, which is the default configuration. Try to set this to false in tiapp.xml and see what happens? This should fix it. Let us know. Thanks.</li>
<li>Luke Lu 2019-09-19

   Hi Sharif, Thanks for helping out, Yeah it's related to close mostly.
   so, I cleaned everything and started over from installing appcelerator/alloys...
   changed tiapp.xml
   <enable-launch-screen-storyboard>false</enable-launch-screen-storyboard>
   
   Output: 
   - Still the same, the crash does happen again
   - Weird thing on UI, UI kinda zoomed (?)
   
   so, back to true , also there wont be this issue on 8.0.1.GA
   
   Let me know what else we could do ?</li>
<li>Sharif AbuDarda 2019-09-23

   Hello, with <enable-launch-screen-storyboard>false</enable-launch-screen-storyboard> the crash should be reduced than before? Also, Can you share the zoomed behavior? Hello, we need a sample test case that demonstrates the behavior in SDK 8.1.1.GA. Right not it's working fine in SDK 8.0.1.GA? We need a sample code to verify the difference between the two SDK. Thanks. </li>
