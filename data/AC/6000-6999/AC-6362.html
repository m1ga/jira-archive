<h3>Description</h3>

I have an issue while running an app with LiveView enabled. In details, when the app reloads (after a file has been modified) the i18n translation function seems to be broken, i.e., instead of seeing the actual translation of the string, I see the translation key.
E.g.:
A string represented by L('key'), whose value is 'test' defined as follow: 

<code><pre>
&lt;string name="my_string_key"&gt;Value&lt;/string&gt;
</pre></code>

 - Expected behavior: 'Value'
 - Actual behavior: 'my_string_key'

   I tried this out but can't seem to reproduce. For me, the value always remains correct no matter how often I change things, even when changing keys the translations update accordingly.
   
   Can you share a reproducible project? 
   
   My setup:
   <code><pre>
   Titanium SDK 8.0.0.GA and 8.1.0.GA
   CLI  7.1.0
   MacOS 10.14.6 
   Node 10.16.2
   </pre></code></li>

   Unfortunately, there still hasn't been a reproducible situation here. So we'll need to know more before we can implement a fix. It must be something regarding your local machine configuration that causes a problem like this.</li>

   As I said to you on Slack I can't share a project my two projects with you. I know that this can't help you but the weird thing is that it also happens an at least other 3 users as you can see in our thread on Slack. 
   If it is an issue with my configuration, I attach here what I get from _appc info_.

   I have the same behavior on multiple apps that I maintain. There's no test case as it is pretty random - might happen after 2-3 reloads, then fixes itself, then breaks again, rinse, repeat.</li>
