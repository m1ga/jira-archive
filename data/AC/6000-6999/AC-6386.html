   Titanium has 64bit since 7.0.0.GA <a href="https://devblog.axway.com/mobile-apps/ga-release-of-titanium-sdk-7-0-0-hyperloop-cli-7-0-0-appcelerator-studio-5-0-0/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://devblog.axway.com/mobile-apps/ga-release-of-titanium-sdk-7-0-0-hyperloop-cli-7-0-0-appcelerator-studio-5-0-0/</a>
   
   Did you add the x86_64 by hand into the <code>&lt;abi&gt;</code> list? Are you trying to export to a device or emulator?</li>
<li>shishir.roy 2019-09-30

   I have added manually and while building i am getting above error
   
   Wanted to support 64 bit as mention in android document:
   <a href="https://developer.android.com/distribute/best-practices/develop/64-bit" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://developer.android.com/distribute/best-practices/develop/64-bit</a>
   </li>
<li>Michael Gangolf 2019-09-30

   x86 support has been removed by default. You can just leave the <code>&lt;abi&gt;</code> section empty and it will automatically build for arm and arm64. </li>
<li>shishir.roy 2019-09-30

   I have kept <abi>all</abi>, after uploading the build 
   
   Native platforms: arm64-v8a, armeabi-v7a 
   
   Can you please confirm the above thing  is supported 64 bit ?
   
   Or should we need to make it up like below:
   Native platforms: arm64-v8a, armeabi, armeabi-v7a, x86, x86_64
   
   If yes then please provide the solution for that </li>
<li>Michael Gangolf 2019-09-30

   as you can see it is including arm64. And you would see a warning if you upload a non-64bit file.
   You don't need to do anything special (even the all part can be removed). Since 7.0.0 all APKs supprt 64bit! </li>
<li>Joshua Quick 2019-09-30

   I recommend that you remove the <code>&lt;abi/&gt;</code> element from your "tiapp.xml" file.
   
   When you do a "production" build, Titanium only includes "arm64-v8a" and "armeabi-v7a" by default. These are the 64-bit and 32-bit ARM architectures. You can upload an APK with these 2 architectures without issue to Google Play.
   
   When you do a "test" or "development" build, Titanium includes the "arm64-v8a", "armeabi-v7a", and "x86" architectures. The added x86 architecture is needed by the Android emulator. You do NOT want to upload an APK with x86 architecture to Google Play because it will be rejected since "x86_64" architecture is not included.
   
   Titanium does not currently support "x86_64" (it would mean breaking backward compatibility with ALL modules and rebuilding them). But the x86_64 architecture is only used by the Android emulator anyways. It's not practical to upload an APK with that architecture.</li>

   Hello [~shishir.roy], Did you follow the guide up? What's the update of your issue? Let us know. Thanks.</li>
<li>shishir.roy 2019-11-08

   I have tried to upload android app, but getting below error:
   
   Error
   
   
   This release is not compliant with the Google Play 64-bit requirement
   
   The following APKs or App Bundles are available to 64-bit devices, but they only have 32-bit native code: 4.
   
   Include 64-bit and 32-bit native code in your app. Use the Android App Bundle publishing format to automatically ensure that each device architecture receives only the native code it needs. This avoids increasing the overall size of your app. Learn More
   
   
   My ti.xaml file configuration:
   
   <sdk-version>7.5.1.GA</sdk-version>
    <abi>armeabi-v7a,arm64-v8a,x86</abi>
   
   I have tried with all configurations:
    1) <abi>all</abi>
    2) removing abi tag 
   
   Let me know how to resolve this issue and this is a high priority.

   [~shishir.roy] The error says that the APK with the number 4 (versionCode) is not valid. Is that the latest APK or an old one that is not active/used. What is the versionCode of the APK your are uploading?
   And don't upload a x86 build. The x86_64 is not supported as described above</li>
<li>shishir.roy 2019-11-08

    I have uploaded with version code 4. Please correct me below one are valid 
    <abi>armeabi-v7a,arm64-v8a</abi> 
    
    This works for all arm devices </li>
<li>Michael Gangolf 2019-11-08

    Yes, or just remove the <abi> block. That will automatically generate those versions </li>
<li>shishir.roy 2019-11-08

    I have tried that also but still it shows error. 
    Removed completely <abi> tag from ti.xml</li>
<li>Michael Gangolf 2019-11-08

    any modules?</li>
<li>shishir.roy 2019-11-08

    Check below modules:
    
    <modules>
        <module platform="android">ti.map</module>
        <module platform="android" version="4.0.3">ti.barcode</module>
        <module platform="android" version="3.0.2">appcelerator.encrypteddatabase</module>
        <module platform="android" version="2.1.0">ti.identity</module>
      </modules></li>

    Regarding the Google Play error message...
    <code><pre>
    The following APKs or App Bundles are available to 64-bit devices, but they only have 32-bit native code: 4
    </pre></code>
    
    What's happening is Google is complaining about a previous APK that you've uploaded not being supported. For your app, it's complaining about the APK having version code <code>4</code> (that's the <code>4</code> you are seeing the error message; it's unique to your app). If you "deactivate" it in Google Play, you'll stop getting those errors.
    
    Bottom line, there is probably nothing wrong with the APK you are uploading. Just make sure to delete the <code>&lt;abi/&gt;</code> part from the "tiapp.xml", deactivate the older APK, and you'll be fine.

    Hi,
    
    I have uploaded a new build to the play store still facing this error. Why is Appcelerator not supporting x86_64 library if it is mandatory for submitting/updating app on play store.
    
    SDK: 8.0.0 GA
     Appcelerator Studio build: 5.1.1.201809051655
    
    Could anyone provide any updates on this. This is a high priority bug need to fix is ASAP.</li>

    [~shishir.roy] Are you still having this issue? If so could you please attach your tiapp.xml file?
    
    Thanks!</li>
