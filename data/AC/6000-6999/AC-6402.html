<h3>Description</h3>

Since Titanium SDK 8.1.1 and 8.2.0 Geolocation updte events stops receiving updates after a few seconds. This happens both in device and simulator, even when app is in foreground.

Sample code:

_+Permissions for geolocation have been requested+_


<code><pre>
Ti.Geolocation.accuracy = Titanium.Geolocation.ACCURACY_BEST;
Ti.Geolocation.distanceFilter = 0;

Ti.Geolocation.addEventListener('location', function(e){
	Ti.API.info(JSON.stringify(e.coords));
});
</pre></code>


After a few cycles of updates, location event stops been called. I have a Ti.Map on app screen, and user location shows movement as expected. 

This issue happened with iOS 12 and Titanium SDK 8.2.0GA but It solved when using SDK 8.0.1 (now not available since iOS 13 and Xcode 11)

   Ok, I didn't see any reference about the location module being touched in release 8.3.0 of Titanium SDK, but the issue was fixed now.
