<h3>Description</h3>

This error occurs randomly often throughout our app and every user who has updated to the latest  iOS is reporting crashes.  Any suggestions on how I may be able to track this down or what is causing it.  Here is the exception thrown just before the crash: 

<code><pre>

   The error suggests that a child view is not actually part of the parent view anymore. Likely something is wrong with your view hierarchy and has now been causing issues with newer iOS versions.</li>

   I see.  Thank you for the hint.</li>

   [~jerodfritz] Did you try the [~hknoechel] suggestion? Please let us know with some reproducible test cases if you still having this issue.
   
   Thanks!</li>

   Thank you for checking in.  You can close this.  It took some digging but ultimately Hans was correct.  I was trying to alter a textfield while it was not part of the view hierarchy.  </li>
