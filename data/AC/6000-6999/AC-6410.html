<h3>Description</h3>

I've been getting intermittent (maybe 5-10 per hour) 500 responses from the ArrowDB service since October 16th, with the message:

"Request returned with HTTP status code 500 Internal server error. The Appcelerator Cloud Services Team has just been notified of this problem".

Are there any current issues with the ArrowDB service? Is there a status page showing current issues? How can I go about debugging this further?

   Hello Barry Green!
   Thanks for reaching out! Would you mind if I request more details about your problem? 
   1. Apps Name 
   2. GUID
   3. cURL command
   Did you check your API with post_man? </li>

   Hello [~bgreen], We haven't heard back from you. Are you still having the issue? Please provide the information asked by Aminul. Thank you.</li>

   Are you serious? I replied to Aminul on the same day that the questions were asked, and then he told me that a JIRA had been opened and the engineering team would take care of it. Since then I've had very little communication from Axway, until the 2nd November when Motiur Rahman replied to tell me that the engineering team was still working on it. Then he replied to me on the 5th November asking me if I still had the issue, to which I replied yes! Since then there has been no more communication from Axway, despite me emailing several times and trying to impress upon them how critical this situation is. I'm a paying MBS customer and your database is failing randomly - that is not acceptable.
   
   Yesterday I was told (through a community contact on ti-slack) that my issue has been escalated and "higher-ups have been informed". Do you not even communicate with each other internally? This is ridiculous. Were you told to contact me as a result of this "escalation" or is your comment completely independent of all this?</li>

   Hello [~bgreen], I apologize for the [~sdarda] comment. We have another internal Mbaas ticket where we are actively looking into this. We were able to reproduce this issue and our engineering team is working for a fix.
   
   Weâ€™ll keep you updated on the progress of this issue.
