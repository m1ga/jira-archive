					"body": "Are you serious? I replied to Aminul on the same day that the questions were asked, and then he told me that a JIRA had been opened and the engineering team would take care of it. Since then I've had very little communication from Axway, until the 2nd November when Motiur Rahman replied to tell me that the engineering team was still working on it. Then he replied to me on the 5th November asking me if I still had the issue, to which I replied yes! Since then there has been no more communication from Axway, despite me emailing several times and trying to impress upon them how critical this situation is. I'm a paying MBS customer and your database is failing randomly - that is not acceptable.\r\n\r\nYesterday I was told (through a community contact on ti-slack) that my issue has been escalated and \"higher-ups have been informed\". Do you not even communicate with each other internally? This is ridiculous. Were you told to contact me as a result of this \"escalation\" or is your comment completely independent of all this?",
