<h3>Description</h3>

Hi. I am having the following problem, and I would like you to help me solve it:
I have a SearchBar associated with a ListView. When I execute a search and no results are found, the "noresults" event of the ListView is called twice.
Thank you

   Hi! Thanks for reporting the problem. Could you share your code that reproduces the issue? Preferably as minimal as possible, the best case would be a single-file classic example.</li>
