<h3>Description</h3>

Hi
I'm a long time user of Appcelerator Studio...
I resently got a new Mac, and needed to install Studio from scratch
Here is my findings...

Im on macOS Catalina, freshly installed 2 weeks ago
Xcode 11.1 installed

Downloaded latest version of Axway Appcelerator Studio, build: 5.1.4.201909061933
Ran the installer
Started Studio...
Studio Popped up the Install SDK window
IOS SDK installed
Android SDK installed... 

Ohh no Dashboard still says Android not installed
Googled a little and found that:
Android 10 (29) is not supported... 
So why did Studio install that version?
Installed Android Studio (It has a great SDK Manager) uninstalled 10 and installed 9(28)
Great Dashboard says Android Installed

Created a New Mobile App Project with Axway Appcelerator Platform Services enabled
App created... 
But again... Ohh no Axway Appcelerator services are partially enabled
Clicked Enable Services... no change restarted Studio... no change restarted machine... no change
Seems like tiapp.xml has all the right properties 
and alloy.js even has some user login code... 
Well maybe it's just the TiApp Editor showing a false negative..
Started the app on iPhone 11 emulator
Now Studio get all Sluggish and unresponsive :(
Googled a bit... Found that max version of Node supported is 8.16, and I'm on 10.x the LTS version when installed
Uninstalled Node and alle modules...
Started Studio... and it installed node and all modules again...
Now I'm on the Node 8.16 and Studio is not so sluggish any more..

Started my newly created app again...and guess what the log says
[WARN] :   DEPRECATION NOTICE: Titanium SDK 9 will no longer support Node.js 8 or lower. We intend to support Node.js 10/12 LTS, which will be 10.13 or higher.
Well OK seems a little odd but OK, guess this is just a service message..

Next thing in the log 
[WARN] :   The implicit global scope for variable declarations in app.js is deprecated in 7.5.0, and will be removed in 9.0.0
[WARN] :   See <a href="http://go.appcelerator.com/Titanium_SDK_7.5.0_Functionality_Update" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://go.appcelerator.com/Titanium_SDK_7.5.0_Functionality_Update</a> for more info
What I haven't written a single line of code...
Well ok the App creater wizzard added the login code to alloy.js could this be it?
Delete the code... but no the warning is still there... 

That conclude my findings... but leaves me with a few questions.

1 Can it be right that a newly installed Studio installs the wrong Android SDK?
2 Is Node 8 realy the max supported version at this time?
3 Does my newly created App have a problem with Appcelerator services?
	It seems to be working...the Ti.info(result) logs info allright...
	But why is it reported af partially Enabled? Where can I see whats not enabled?
4 Is the warning about "implicit global scope" somthing to be worried about?

   Hello!
   Thanks for reaching out! 
   1. A newly installed Studio installs the correct Android SDK. Sometime Appc Studio and the CLI be set up with different Android SDK paths.
   2. We support Node.js 10/12 LTS,
   3. You can check your  Appcelerator services in your tiapp.xml. You can also enable all  Appcelerator services with tiapp.xml 
   4. The implicit global scope for variable declarations in app.js is deprecated in 7.5.0, and will be removed in 9.0.0. Don't worry about that.
   
   Regards,
   Aminul Islam
