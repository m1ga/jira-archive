		"description": "Hi\r\nI'm a long time user of Appcelerator Studio...\r\nI resently got a new Mac, and needed to install Studio from scratch\r\nHere is my findings...\r\n\r\nIm on macOS Catalina, freshly installed 2 weeks ago\r\nXcode 11.1 installed\r\n\r\nDownloaded latest version of Axway Appcelerator Studio, build: 5.1.4.201909061933\r\nRan the installer\r\nStarted Studio...\r\nStudio Popped up the Install SDK window\r\nIOS SDK installed\r\nAndroid SDK installed... \r\n\r\nOhh no Dashboard still says Android not installed\r\nGoogled a little and found that:\r\nAndroid 10 (29) is not supported... \r\nSo why did Studio install that version?\r\nInstalled Android Studio (It has a great SDK Manager) uninstalled 10 and installed 9(28)\r\nGreat Dashboard says Android Installed\r\n\r\nCreated a New Mobile App Project with Axway Appcelerator Platform Services enabled\r\nApp created... \r\nBut again... Ohh no Axway Appcelerator services are partially enabled\r\nClicked Enable Services... no change restarted Studio... no change restarted machine... no change\r\nSeems like tiapp.xml has all the right properties \r\nand alloy.js even has some user login code... \r\nWell maybe it's just the TiApp Editor showing a false negative..\r\nStarted the app on iPhone 11 emulator\r\nNow Studio get all Sluggish and unresponsive :(\r\nGoogled a bit... Found that max version of Node supported is 8.16, and I'm on 10.x the LTS version when installed\r\nUninstalled Node and alle modules...\r\nStarted Studio... and it installed node and all modules again...\r\nNow I'm on the Node 8.16 and Studio is not so sluggish any more..\r\n\r\nStarted my newly created app again...and guess what the log says\r\n[WARN] :   DEPRECATION NOTICE: Titanium SDK 9 will no longer support Node.js 8 or lower. We intend to support Node.js 10/12 LTS, which will be 10.13 or higher.\r\nWell OK seems a little odd but OK, guess this is just a service message..\r\n\r\nNext thing in the log \r\n[WARN] :   The implicit global scope for variable declarations in app.js is deprecated in 7.5.0, and will be removed in 9.0.0\r\n[WARN] :   See http://go.appcelerator.com/Titanium_SDK_7.5.0_Functionality_Update for more info\r\nWhat I haven't written a single line of code...\r\nWell ok the App creater wizzard added the login code to alloy.js could this be it?\r\nDelete the code... but no the warning is still there... \r\n\r\nThat conclude my findings... but leaves me with a few questions.\r\n\r\n1 Can it be right that a newly installed Studio installs the wrong Android SDK?\r\n2 Is Node 8 realy the max supported version at this time?\r\n3 Does my newly created App have a problem with Appcelerator services?\r\n\tIt seems to be working...the Ti.info(result) logs info allright...\r\n\tBut why is it reported af partially Enabled? Where can I see whats not enabled?\r\n4 Is the warning about \"implicit global scope\" somthing to be worried about?\r\n",

We support Node.js 10/12 LTS,\r\n3. You can check your  Appcelerator services in your tiapp.xml. You can also enable all  Appcelerator services with tiapp.xml \r\n4. The implicit global scope for variable declarations in app.js is deprecated in 7.5.0, and will be removed in 9.0.0. Don't worry about that.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAminul Islam \r\n\r\n",
