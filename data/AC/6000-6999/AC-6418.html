   Sorry, I got an error when I submitted this ticket, so I didn't think it was even created. So here is the appc info output. [^appcinfo.txt] </li>

   Hi.  I think I fixed this.  I can now see my connected iOS devices.
   I deleted all of the provisioning profiles from "/Library/MobileDevice/Provisioning Profiles" and then re-downloaded them.
   Then, I restarted the appc daemon by doing:
   appc appcd restart
   
   Previously, I tried (numerous times):
   appc appcd stop
   appc appcd start
   but that didn't seem to help.
   It wasn't until I did the restart that things began working.
