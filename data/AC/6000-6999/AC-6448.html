<h3>Description</h3>

Hello! Good afternoon!

Until shortly Apple would accept uploads generated by Ti SDK6.3 and Xcode 9 but those days are over...
The Ti.UDP module is used a lot in my projects but I cannot go to the newest SDK's.
I have to make small maintenance releases for a few SDK 6.3 projects and this module is blocking...

Maybe it is just a simple recompile action for iOS and Android?
If it needs testing with real life hardware please let me know.

Additionally would it be an idea to incorporate UDP for iOS and Android as it is already supported for Windows?

Thanks a lot!!

   [~ray@raymondverbruggen.nl], Are you talking about this module? <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator-archive/ti.udp" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator-archive/ti.udp</a>
   
   If so you can rebuild this module with the latest SDK version then test. Here is the module development guide <a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#</a>!/guide/Extending_Titanium_Mobile
   
   Actually, this is our archive module and we don't have official support on it. If you need any further modification then you have to do it at your own risk. Open source code is available there.
   
   Hope you got the point.</li>

   Hello Motiur,
   
   Yes sir I got the point :)
   
   Thanks a lot; you saved my butt...
   How easy! I was able to build both modules, need to test it in a real application.
   
   Could you update the Ti.UDP readme file with your comment above? That would help more people I think.
   If my modules both work, maybe you could put a link in the readme to my repo to help others as well?
   
   I do not understand that Appc does not support it, moreover I think it would fit perfectly in the main lib besides the TCP thingy.
   
   The iOS module build gave this error, and it does not put the built module in the "modules" folder; Android rebuild works fine.

   [~ray@raymondverbruggen.nl] Make sure you have changed the SDK path and version in "titanium.xcconfig" file. Also, change the version number and "minsdk" version in "manifest" file. Finally, build it
   
   - cd test/ios
   - appc run -p ios --build-only
   
   Here is our officially supported module list

   Hope this helps.</li>

   @morahman, building worked fine from Studio. T
   he command line for both ios and android generate a zip file beautifully.
   When you Package module from Studio (also described in the docs) the above error arises and the module is placed in the modules folder for android.
   iOS doesn't do that, and gives the error window as well.
   
   Thank you for the list!
   Nices things in there :)
