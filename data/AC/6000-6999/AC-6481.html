<h3>Description</h3>

Hi, 

I am able to access https via Self Signed Certificate using Ti.Network.createHTTPClient.

Find below code:
<code><pre>
		       var client = Ti.Network.createHTTPClient({
				onload: function(e)
				{
					
				},
				
				onerror: function(e)
				{
					
				}
				timeout: 60000
			});
			
			var tokenFormData = {object: "object"};
			
			client.open("POST", url);
			client.setRequestHeader("Content-Type","application/x-www-form-urlencoded");
			
			client.send(tokenFormData); 
</pre></code>

As per the documentation, Self-signed should not able to use "https" and it should "Certificate for this server is invalid"
But I am able to use a Self Signed Certificate in Android.

Android OS: 9
SDK: 8.2.1.GA

Please suggest

   Probably due to testing/dev mode, where validation is not done properly (as expected). Can you enable the property and try again?

   Now, I am able to use this property and its is working as expected.
   But this is the usual way to use this property every time.Can you please confirm. </li>

   This is expected behavior, yes. But you don't need to set the property as for production builds that property is set by default, as also explained in the documentation.
   
   I'll close the ticket if you have any further questions regarding using the SDK feel free to ask the community as well, you might get responses even faster. You can find the community on <a href="https://tislack.org" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://tislack.org</a> </li>
