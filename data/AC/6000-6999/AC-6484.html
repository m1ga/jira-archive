<h3>Description</h3>

Hi,

For details of my ticket, please clone project at this git repo.  The project was too large to attach here.

<a href="https://github.com/ericpolkadoc/androidtextarealinks" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/ericpolkadoc/androidtextarealinks</a>

Summary:
I am having an issue when applying a link listener to a textarea, when using attributedStrings.  In one instance I am not able to access the e.url on Android.  iOS works as expected.

Explanation:
When running the cloned project, there are 2 buttons in the index.js.

- No require - all logic is done in the messages.js controller.  There are no issues, attributedStrings work as expected.

- With require - in this example, I am Require'ing the UI/ui.message.js controller, which has a "link" listener applied to the attributedStrings in the textarea, which I expect to let me access the e.url.

In this 2nd instance, on Android, the links are clickable, but they are all treated as external links, as the "link" event is not being fired, and I cannot access e.url of the attributedString.

Is there a reason why the link event listener is removed when using the require'd version vs the all-in-one controller version?

Thanks!
