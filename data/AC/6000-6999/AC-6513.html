   Have you launched Xcode after updating? 
   
   What TiSDK are you currently using? You should be on 8.2.0.GA+. Also update to the latest NodeJS 10.x, and make sure your appc CLI is on the latest version as well, which is 8.0.0</li>

   Thank you...yes, I have launched Xcode after updating...
   
   TiSDK...8.3.1, 9.0.0
   CLI 8.0.0 (latest)
   
   I've been reading about others having the same issue on TiSlack...it required going back to xCode 11.3 and node 10.13 and TiSDK 9.0.0
   
   I am going to try that combo next...</li>
