<h3>Description</h3>

When using e.g: Ti.Platform.openURL("<a href="https://google.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://google.com</a>");

it throws an error;
<code><pre>
[ERROR] :  Script Error {
[ERROR] :      toJSON = "&lt;KrollCallback: 0x282b0e780&gt;";
[ERROR] :  }
</pre></code>
it spams the log. Anyone that knows why or how to solve it?

   I tried to reproduce using SDK 9.0.0.GA and it works fine for me. Does it work for you in a new empty application?</li>

   [~oakleaf], odds are the issue is coming from one of your event listeners.
   
   Unfortunately, since you have the newest Xcode 11.4 installed, Titanium is failing to acquire a stacktrace. That's why you're seeing a <code>toJSON</code> error instead. We're looking into resolve this in the near future.
   
   For now, trying building/running it for Android instead to isolate the issue.

   Ticket for better stack traces in Xcode 11.4: TIMOB-27827</li>

   [~oakleaf] I've seen this as well. This error will show if you do not provide the optional callback parameter. So you have to do something like this: <code>Ti.Platform.openURL(url, null, ()=&gt;{});</code></li>

   Resolved as duplicate of linked ticket. Fix was just pushed to master/9_1_X/9_3_X. Release 9.1.0 will contain it. (or if you really need the fix and don't want to use the empty function callback workaround, you should be able to install a new 9_0_X branch build via <code>ti sdk install -b. 9_0_X</code> in about an hour once the build goes out)</li>
