<h3>Description</h3>

process of our App change when we update SDK Version from 7.4.2 to 8.3.1.
The view was shown as soon as open() was called by SDK 7.4.2 when we run app on debugger.

<code><pre>
function viewOpen() {
  var dummyController = Alloy.createController('dummy', {});
  dummyController.getView().open(); *open method
  ・・・heavy process・・・
}
</pre></code>

But the view was shown after viewOpen() by SDK 8.3.1.

How can it be solved?

   Your title and description seem completely unrelated.
   
   To answer the question in your description, for any heavy action, wait until the UI is rendered (use postlayout event, and keep in mind the event can fire more than once), and do the heavy action after.
   
   But... try to prevent doing anything heavy, and/or refactor it so it is chopped into smaller lighter processes. However, as also mentioned on your other ticket, JIRA is not intended as a Q&A. I'm going to close this ticket, and if you need more information ask on <a href="https://tislack.org" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://tislack.org</a> in the #helpme channel</li>
