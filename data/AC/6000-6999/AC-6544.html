<h3>Description</h3>

Apps for iPhone or iPad must be built with the iOS 13 SDK or later and use an Xcode storyboard to provide the app's launch screen.

I looked here and storyboard enabled.
<a href="https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides2/iOS+Launch+Files" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides2/iOS+Launch+Files</a>

Added this setting to tiapp.xml.
But Compatibility mode is disabled and ipad pro is displayed at initial resolution.
<code><pre>
&lt;enable-launch-screen-storyboard&gt;true&lt;/enable-launch-screen-storyboard&gt;
</pre></code>

Also I've got a messy layout.
Therefore, is there a storyboard compatibility mode?

   If you want to support iPad, you will need to target iPad too. Storyboard makes sure it runs fullscreen on all iPhone devices if you only got iPhone selected as target. If you selected iPad as target it will run fullscreen on all iPads.
   
   If your layout is messed up because of the increase in screensize, you will have to adjust your layout to handle dynamic sizes better!
