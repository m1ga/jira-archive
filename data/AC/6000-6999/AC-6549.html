<h3>Description</h3>

I've tried to update a renewed Apple Push Notification Certificate through the AMPLIFY Dashboard (<a href="http://platform.axway.com)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://platform.axway.com)</a>

I upload the .p12 certificate and enter the certificate password but I get the error message " "certificate" is a required parameter‚Äù.

Both the certificate and password are valid.

I was able to upload certificates successfully earlier this month.

Most recent Dashboard release was this week: Dashboard 7.3.3 - 26 May 2020.

   I've run into this exact same issue since Appcelerator Dashboard 7.3.3 was released. I'm been banging my head against the wall because this is causing production delays, so any expediency that could be taken would be much appreciated! It was working for me on 5/18/2020. Thank you very much!</li>

   [~bronstar] [~trevor.crawford] we have a fix in review now. There's a 7.3.4 release slated for today we're looking to pull that into.  We'll resolve this once the fix is in place and vetted.</li>
