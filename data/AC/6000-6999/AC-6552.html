<h3>Description</h3>

Hi, sometimes building my Android app CLI stucks during:

<code>[INFO]  Writing build manifest: /Users/ferdi2005/Apps/WikiLovesMonuments/build/android/build-manifest.json</code>

Every next trying to build it stops working and then, magically, it returns working: neither deleting build-manifest.json nor the entire Android folder work.

Sometimes it works perfectly and even when it stucks, it builds a perfectly-working APK file, the only problem is that I can't debug and use console.

Thank you very much in advance.

   It seems that this problem appears when I don't close (exit) my terminal and open a new one to make builds commands.</li>
