<h3>Description</h3>

I want to create my Classic app with the Titanium SDK 9.0.3.GA. I get the following information in the console:

<code><pre>
[GRADLE] BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 12s
App successfully installed
Starting app: _ch.test.app_
</pre></code>

However, the app does not start, even after a long wait. There is no mistake, no clues.

<code><pre>
[ERROR] Application Installer abnormal process termination. Process exit value was 1
[ERROR] :  Application failed to launch
The current timeout is set to 300000 ms
You can increase this timeout by running: titanium.js config android.appStartTimeout &lt;timeout ms&gt;
</pre></code>

It doesn't work in the studio and in the terminal.

What else can I do to get the app to start again? It works perfectly under SDK 8.3.1.GA. As of SDK 9.0.0.GA, it no longer works.

Thanks

   Note: same situation on emulator and on device
   And: some Alloy Apps do not start under SDK 9.0.3.GA either</li>

   I found the mistake. There was a conflict between the 
   <code><pre>
   &lt;android&gt;
   </pre></code>
    in the tiapp.xml and AndroidManifest.xml. There was an 
   <code><pre>
   &lt;application&gt;
   </pre></code>
    in both files and Gradle expects only one. </li>

   [~aschattat], you can definitely have an <code>&lt;application/&gt;</code> block in both the "tiapp.xml" and "./platform/android/AndroidManifest.xml" file. I've tested it and it works.
   
   I'm not sure what you're doing. It would help if you showed us what your "AndroidManifest.xml" looked like. I suspect it was replacing something that the install process depended on.
   
   FYI: Titanium 9.x.x uses gradle to merge "AndroidManifest.xml" files. So, I suspect what you had might have confused the Android Studio IDE as well. But we can double check to be sure.</li>
