<h3>Description</h3>

The latest update to Ti.Compression which now supports building against SDK 9.0.x+ has taken a backwards step in that it can no-longer handle zip64 files.

zip64 files are important if the file size is over 4gb or there are more than 65,000+ files in it. Which for my large client this is the case on their initial download.

I was able to fix this issue myself by manually re-building the module against my old update (I previously fixed this issue over a year ago but have forgotten the exact steps I took). I'm pretty sure my update has a newer version of minizip which solves the issue.

I've attached my zipped up module code so you can see the difference. If you are unable to locate a zip64 file I can provide a link but it's 2.3gb. 

You can run my updated module it's in /dist/ti.compression-2.0.1
