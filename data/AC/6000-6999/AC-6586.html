<h3>Description</h3>

Hi Team,

We are upgrading our Mac book OS to Mac Version 10.14.6 (18G103), we will use Axway Appcelerator Studio, build: 4.10.0.201709271713. 

Can you please let us know if after upgrading the Studio we could use the same Android SDK or we will have to donwload new SDK?

   [~ios.admin@investis.com], Appcelerator Studio was released in October 2017. As this is now out of support and is well outside of our support cycle lifetime I cannot do anything but recommend you upgrade to Studio 6.0.0 available to download [here](<a href="https://platform.axway.com/#/product/studio)." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://platform.axway.com/#/product/studio).</a>
   
   It's not clear to me what you mean by <code>use the same Android SDK </code>, could you please clarify? If you mean whether you can use the already installed Android SDK, then yes I would assume so.
   
   Lastly, please use this jira for bug issues only. It is not a support line</li>
