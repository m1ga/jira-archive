		"description": "I have a bug with the Axway Cloud services regarding Android notifications. I have been discussing the problem with Joshua Quick. The problem seems account related, but may be a firebase/Google configuration problem related to the Axway service. Since we got a server error a few days ago of  \"Subscription not found\" our app won't receive android notifications. It's odd if it is an account problem that iOS should still work, but that is indeed what it seems to be.\r\n\r\nIn the new version of our app I upgraded to SDK 9.0.3 and implemented the new ti.cloudpush module v7.1.0. This was according to advise from Joshua Quick to solve a previous bug we had with notifications on Android being registered multiple times on the same device. The new updates did fix this previous bug. As part of this upgrade process we had to create a new firebase project and migrate our old GCM service to firebase. In the app this involved installing a new google-services.json file. So after these updates Android notifications seemed to work well (there is an outstanding issue of notifications not being received if the app is force restarted, but that apparently is a Google issue/bug).\r\n\r\nSince then we did a new round of testing on 6th August and during testing received a server bug. The screen grab of the server log is attached. In the Axway Dashboard the error was \"Subscription not found\". Since receiving this bug all Android notifications have stopped working.\r\n\r\nSo to recap. All Android notifications were working. After receiving the server error described above and with no other software changes Android notifications stopped working.\r\n\r\nPlease contact me directly for Axway account details.",

I suspect that it did at first sometime ago, but now doesn't, as I came across a comment in a firebase video that this became unsupported around May 2020. So we are left with the fact that we will have to break our old app after publishing the new version as the keys will have to change. I did notice another service provider (providing cross-platform notifications) which allows users to support more than one set of keys, which could be a way around it.
