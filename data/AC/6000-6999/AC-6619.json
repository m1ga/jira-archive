If the app fails to find a string resource for the current locale, it will fallback to \"en\", and then finally to unlocalized strings under \"res/values/strings.xml\".\r\nhttps://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/multilingual-support\r\n\r\nSo, before Titanium 9.0.0, if you ran your app on a device without an \"it\" locale, your string lookups would have been {{null}} on Android. With Google's gradle build system, it's now validating your i18n string resources, logging build warnings if you have any string entries missing under the \"en\" which is the default fallback, and removing entries so that it behaves consistently in non-english locales. Basically, Google is letting you know your app has internationalization issues. I don't consider this a bug. Especially since a native Android developer would run into the same warnings.\r\n",

					"body": "I suppose we can do things to make this easier and turn this into a feature request ticket.\r\n\r\nLike if you only have 1 language defined, then our build system should just automatically make it the default by duplicating the strings xml to the unlocalized Android {{./res/values}} folder. However, this won't handle the issue where an app has more than one non-English strings xml files.\r\n\r\nAnother possible approach may be to support a {{./i18n/default}} folder which would become the default strings fallback. On Android, we would just copy that default strings xml to the unlocalized {{./res/values}} folder. We would just have to see what we would have to do on the iOS side for parity.\r\n\r\nAnyways, those are just some ideas I'm throwing out here, because I do agree with you that it would be nice to make this more convenient for non-English apps.",
