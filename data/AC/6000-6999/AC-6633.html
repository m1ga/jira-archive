<h3>Description</h3>

*Problem*
Currently an app.tss file is compiled into every "/android/alloy/styles/" style and increases it's file size and has redundant code.

*Example*
E.g. if you have a very large app.tss (1MB) and 5 controllers with no style you'll end up with five 1MB files (= 5MB total) instead of one 1MB and five empty files (= 1MB total).

*Idea:*
Controllers use require to include alloy or other controllers already. Why not create a /Resources/android/alloy/styles/app.js file and include that file in the other compiled styled file and merge it to their style.

   I've already tried to edit <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/alloy/blob/1b9fd4685f0a6abebe1620b021c1d360523f9e8b/Alloy/commands/compile/index.js#L673" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/alloy/blob/1b9fd4685f0a6abebe1620b021c1d360523f9e8b/Alloy/commands/compile/index.js#L673</a> and I'm able to write a appTss.js file. I just have trouble including it in the other style files. Tried it with require but it doesn't seem to work here</li>

   This also affects iOS Apps.
