   the log is saying "TiApplication: (main) Titanium 7.4.2 (2018/11/19)" even 8.0.0 would be very old :) Did you try it with a newer SDK already? 9.3.1.GA was just released. And there are mutliple 8.x releases in between</li>

   Hi Michael,
   
   Thank you for your answer,
   I know that the logs indicates 7.4.2.GA, but i confirm that the app was built with 8.0.0.GA (tiapp.xml file).
   
   However, like you said 8.0.0 would be very old too.
   So, just after i wrote this post, i was thinking that maybe an SDK update would be good to test, because its an Android 9+ issue and the more recent the SDK is, the more compatible with new Android versions is, i guess.
   
   For now, the app seems more stable than before (some UI issues appeared before when closing view or windows, app was randomly going in background...).
   And till i do not reproduce the freeze with that version i will say that this topic is resolved.
   
   I will come back to open it, with new logs, if the problem is still encoutered by my client.
   
   Regards,
   Laurent</li>

   Older version of the Titanium SDK used to include apache libraries which won't work on Android P (API Level 28) or higher since Google's has removed support for them on the newest OS versions.
   
   You need to use Titanium 7.5.0 or higher. Titanium 7.5.0 supports "targeting" Android P (older Titanium versions do not). But of course I recommend updating to Titanium 9.3.x if you can since that version of Titanium supports "targeting" Android 11.</li>

   Hi Joshua,
   Thanks for your answer,
   
   Like i said to Michael, i compiled the app in 8.0.0.GA till now and the log was indicating 7.4.2, how is it possible ?
   The log in question is the following :
   2021-01-26 16:10:35.064 12942-12942/? I/TiApplication: (main) [15,15] Titanium 7.4.2 (2018/11/19 09:49 undefined)
   
   Anyway i updated my Android native module (which was still compiled with 8.0.0 till now) to 9.3.1 and app to 9.3.1.
   The last time i tested the app, i reproduced the issue even compiling with 9.3.1.GA, i guess it can be the fault of the native Android module which was still in 8.0.0 and maybe causing the problem.
   
   I will come back to let you now if the problem is solved or now,
   Regards,
   Laurent
