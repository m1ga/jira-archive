					"body": "Hi Michael,\r\n\r\nThank you for your answer,\r\nI know that the logs indicates 7.4.2.GA, but i confirm that the app was built with 8.0.0.GA (tiapp.xml file).\r\n\r\nHowever, like you said 8.0.0 would be very old too.\r\nSo, just after i wrote this post, i was thinking that maybe an SDK update would be good to test, because its an Android 9+ issue and the more recent the SDK is, the more compatible with new Android versions is, i guess.\r\n\r\nFor now, the app seems more stable than before (some UI issues appeared before when closing view or windows, app was randomly going in background...).\r\nAnd till i do not reproduce the freeze with that version i will say that this topic is resolved.\r\n\r\nI will come back to open it, with new logs, if the problem is still encoutered by my client.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nLaurent",

Titanium 7.5.0 supports \"targeting\" Android P (older Titanium versions do not). But of course I recommend updating to Titanium 9.3.x if you can since that version of Titanium supports \"targeting\" Android 11.",

I/TiApplication: (main) [15,15] Titanium 7.4.2 (2018/11/19 09:49 undefined)\r\n\r\nAnyway i updated my Android native module (which was still compiled with 8.0.0 till now) to 9.3.1 and app to 9.3.1.\r\nThe last time i tested the app, i reproduced the issue even compiling with 9.3.1.GA, i guess it can be the fault of the native Android module which was still in 8.0.0 and maybe causing the problem.\r\n\r\nI will come back to let you now if the problem is solved or now,\r\nRegards,\r\nLaurent\r\n\r\n",
