<h3>Description</h3>

Hello guys, I received this email this morning from Google.

Google Play’s Billing Library helps developers to build high-quality apps that users love, with safe and secure experiences that users expect. Last July, we announced Billing Library 3 with new payment options, subscription promotion capabilities, game purchase attribution, and improved reliability and security.

I use the old inappbilling module. I think the Appcelerator community needs an updated inapp module to monetize the apps.

Thanks

   Thanks for your ticket, however I will be closing this ticket as "won't fix" because of the following reasons.
   
   * <code>ti.inappbilling</code> is an archived module. Meaning we currently do not maintain it (entirely)
   * Axway/Appcelerator will stop new functionality development after SDK 10.0.0 and will only perform needed maintenance.
   
   This means, adding a feature to a module (upgrading dependencies) that is currently in our archive will be a very low priority and most likely won't be implemented until Titanium is handed over to the community. I recommend looking towards community implementations for inappbilling.</li>

   In case you're interested in the v3 module (private module), check out the details here: <a href="https://github.com/hansemannn/titanium-play-billing-demo/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/hansemannn/titanium-play-billing-demo/</a></li>

   Thanks Hans. I'm migrating to native. I think it is not a good option to have to pay for a service that I consider basic and should be covered from the beginning. What will this become if we all start charging our modules for these types of functions? Imagine (Firebase, Facebook, Maps, Apple Sign In, etc, etc, etc.). It is not viable</li>

   No worries! After being 10+ years in the Titanium game, I paid for many modules that require integration support, especially for BLE / billing flows. But as you go native already, we should be good here!</li>

   Do not take it the wrong way, but remember that the next course is OpenSource and its philosophy does not agree with what you are defending. Anyway, even if I am migrating to native I will contribute what is within my reach as I always did with the Titanium community.</li>
