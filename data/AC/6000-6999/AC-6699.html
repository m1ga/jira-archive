<h3>Description</h3>

The Facebook module currently allows us to set the app event variables in the info.plist but does not let us alter them at runtime.

This is required as with iOS14.5 and appTrackingTransparency we need to start with these 'false' and enable them once the user has agreed.

Facebook has a page that discusses exactly how to do this and we need this making available through the module:

<a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/app-events/getting-started-app-events-ios#disable-auto-events" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://developers.facebook.com/docs/app-events/getting-started-app-events-ios#disable-auto-events</a>

In essence we need the Ti equivalent of:

[FBSDKSettings setAutoLogAppEventsEnabled:YES];
[FBSDKSettings setAdvertiserIDCollectionEnabled:@YES];

I believe that this is a critical issue as currently there is no way to integrate facebook correctly without disabling event collection completely.
