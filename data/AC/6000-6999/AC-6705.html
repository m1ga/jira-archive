   [~tw], I believe this was resolved via intercom? The issue was a folder named <code>payload</code> if I remember correctly?</li>

   Yes.
   Within the /assets folder of my Alloy project, I had a folder labeled "payload". After renaming this folder, the problem was solved. 
   (Thanks to the support of Hans Knöchel who figured this out).</li>
