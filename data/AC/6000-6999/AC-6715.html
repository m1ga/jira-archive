   [~efrancis] could you try logging out using <code>appc logout -D</code> and then logging back in? Your org associated with the email in your jira user appears to have be fine so I'm not sure why you're seeing this</li>

   Thanks for the quick reply. There is another account and app. How can I share that account details? That account also uses a paid subscription plan for Cloud Capacity.
   
   Earlier under that account Application Development pro plan was active, but I think on Mar 2021, subscription ended and I do not see any option to change the plan to Indie plan. On dashboard it says "Application Development" Subscription expired. There is only option to contact sales. Does it stop creating a App Store build?
   The cloud capacity subscription is active and it works fine.

   Could you send the the account email and org id (you can find this on <a href="https://platform.axway.com/#/org)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://platform.axway.com/#/org)</a> to the email in my jira user? If your app dev plan has expired then that is most likely why you're seeing this</li>

   Thanks, sent you the details.</li>

   [~efrancis] I've added an indie subscription to the org that will run til around the EoS date of the platform, that should allow you to build til then (you may need to logout and login to refresh the session). I would recommend moving to use the Ti CLI in advance of that date</li>

   Great, thank you. Yes using Ti CLI to build and it worked.
