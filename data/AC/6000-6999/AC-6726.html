<h3>Description</h3>

Hi Team, 

Recently I have upgraded Titanium SDK 8.3.0.GA to 10.1.0.GA, after upgrading to latest one, Android app all the screens's controls gets small and also font got reduced. 

I did try some settings in ti.xml like   
<property name="ti.ui.defaultunit" type="string">dip</property>  and removed all the units 'dp' in the controls, but it didn't work out for me. 

I have attached the two versions of screenshot for reference. 

Am I missing something here, or something got changed in latest SDK. 

Please suggest, this is very critical for us and we need to resolve as soon as possible.

Thanks,
Shishir

   [~shishir.roy] Did you try any other SDKs between 8.3.0 and 10.1.0? It would be helpful to know if you saw the same on say 9.3.2 for example
   
   Did you try using <code>dp</code> instead of <code>dip</code> as the default unit setting? From the slack conversation you were having with Michael G it appeared like you might need to work on resizing the controls correctly due to changes made between 8.3.0 and 10.1.0 </li>
