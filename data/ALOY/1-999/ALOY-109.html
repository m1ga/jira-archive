   Can you add some more detail, and perhaps examples, to the description? I'm not entirely sure what the goal is for this one.</li>
<li>Russell McMahon 2012-07-18

   This task came from Kevin W. I believe he wanted to extend the markup with his own tags. 
   
   From Kevin:
   
   "Pluggable tag parsers/tag libraries for core Titanium APIs" 
   
   We can ping Kevin to get more detail.</li>
<li>Tony Lukasavage 2012-07-18

   yes, please. I think I understand what he's asking for, but some clarity would be good.</li>

   +1, need to add support for StyledLabel so we can use it in the Alloy xml.</li>

   Requesting to mark this a priority we have customers requesting for the same.

   for reference, you can likely do something very similar by putting your custom code in a widget and then using the widget in your application. It may prove easier than writing custom XML parsers even one the functionality is available.</li>

   made possible by ALOY-522</li>
