   Do you mean lifecycle events? Right now I only created 'onCreate' for the generated components, which is attached via markup like this:
   
   <h4>index.xml</h4>
   <code><pre>
   &lt;Alloy onCreate="doCreate"&gt;
       &lt;!-- the rest of your elements --&gt;
   &lt;/Alloy&gt;
   </pre></code>
   
   <h4>index.js</h4>
   <code><pre>
   function doCreate() {
       // insert code to be executed before generated view and controller code
   }
   </pre></code></li>

   Yup. Looks good but I think we should also have a matching destroy. Are there other App life cycle events we could make available through markup? </li>
<li>Tony Lukasavage 2012-07-18

   Well, we can have a <code>destroy</code> life cycle event, but it would need to be fired manually so I don't know how much sense it makes. I think it might confuse developers if we allow them to specify an <code>onDestroy</code> function, but the event never fires unless they fire/trigger it manually. On the other hand, having a standardized location even for manually triggered <code>destroy</code> operations would be good. I'm not sure how we can be clear that an <code>onCreate</code> happens automatically, but an <code>onDestroy</code> needs to be done manually.</li>

   Can we generate the code to fire an app destroy event so the developer does not manually have to do it?</li>
<li>Tony Lukasavage 2012-07-18

   No, that's the nature of Javascript and why it's been done manually to this point.</li>

   Not sure if this would work but found it online:
   
   Ti.App.addEventListener('pause',function(e)
   {
       // do code here
   });

   I see the pause is an iOS only event so not as helpful</li>
<li>Tony Lukasavage 2012-07-18

   The app in that case can just as easily resume, and you would have destroyed all of its components. Obviously not the desired effect. This makes the case for <code>onPause</code> and <code>onResume</code> events, but we don't have an object to apply them to, as they would apply to the application, not a specific component. It would probably make more sense right now to just handle them as they are now.</li>
