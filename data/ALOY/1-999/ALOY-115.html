   This will likely be more than 5 steps, but I'll keep it in the region of single digits.</li>

   If possibly can we get this by Wed 25 so QE can do a sanity test?</li>

   Here's the quick start: <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/alloy#quick-start" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/alloy#quick-start</a>
   
   We need to discuss if this will be "enough" for this "5 steps" section.</li>

   In todays standup I think Gabriel wanted a link to how to install Titanium Studio. Also links to Joyent and NPM anything you think could be helpful getting started an then go ahead and close this. If we need more docs based on Eric's feedback we can open another ticket and make it specific.</li>

   I put the wiki link in yesterday during our meeting. There is also already a link to nodejs in the quickstart. npm is part of the nodejs distribution, so there's no need to link to it directly.</li>
