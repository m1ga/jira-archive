<h3>Description</h3>

We should add a "platforms" tag to the widget.json manifest file in order to identify which platforms the widget will work on. Something simple like:

<code><pre>
"platforms": "android,ios"
</pre></code>

In addition, this tag should be checked at compile/run time to ensure that an appropriate platform is being used with it. Alloy/Titanium should likely throw an exception or at least launch a warning if an unsupported platform is used with the widget.

   At this point let's just add the tag. Open another ticket for actually processing the tag. I think the tag processing will also be a required with samples and templates although the goal is cross-platform sometimes it is hard to achieve. Managing it is a great compromise.</li>
