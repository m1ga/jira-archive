<h3>Description</h3>

Each widget's widget.json manifest file includes an informational "platforms" tag that indicates on which platforms the widget is supported. We should actually enforce this tag at compile time. We should abort compilation with information regarding the widget and its lack of support. That way developers will immediately know if they are attempting to use a widget on an unsupported platform. 

WE may also want to consider a way to ignore this tag so that it does NOT abort the compilation. Or we could simply post a warning to the log. I'm in favor of actually aborting the compilation.

   Widgets will likely be distributed in a different format, making this ticket irrelevant.</li>
