<h3>Description</h3>

Right now a controller is only processed if it has a corresponding view. The relationship is 1 to 1. We should allow controllers to be processed independently.

This will be useful when developers start making use of the controller inheritance available in Alloy. It also allows developers to write their controllers in pure code outside the context of Alloy and still operate in Titanium applications.

   Developers are asking to be able to create things in pure code already. Granted, we should try to guide them in Alloy usage to avoid this whenever possible using device queries, lifecycle events, etc... but there will likely always be cases where people want full control of the code: <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/alloy/issues/33" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/alloy/issues/33</a></li>
