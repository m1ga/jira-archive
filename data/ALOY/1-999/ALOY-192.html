<h3>Description</h3>

Right now the [sql_model](<a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/alloy/tree/master/test/apps/sql_model)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/alloy/tree/master/test/apps/sql_model)</a> test app doesn't behave much like a normal app. It performs a few model/collection operations under the hood and exposing very little of that via the UI. Also, there is no interactivity in the app.

There's a few options:
<h4>Eliminate the existing sql_model test app after ALOY-191 is completed</h4>
<h4>Keep the existing sql_model test app, but make it behave like a true app. It would also need to exhibit sql-specific functionality to make it worth keeping. So it would need to use SQL queries to access models and collections from its persistent storage. Without the SQL-specific code, it may as well just be showcased by the app created in ALOY-191.</h4>

   Can show either all, active, or done tasks. On iOS it's done with tabbedbar, on Android with menus.</li>
