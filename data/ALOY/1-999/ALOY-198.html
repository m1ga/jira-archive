<h3>Description</h3>

Russ McMahon stated he had a conversation with the iOS team that indicated a change in the way commonjs paths were handled, requiring them to be absolute. Until about a week ago, all platforms worked with the TiSDK 2.2.0 and Alloy using relative commonjs paths. Now only iOS does not work. Android and Mobileweb continue to operate fine with Alloy.
