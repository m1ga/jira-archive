<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>update</h4>

The ti.physicalSizeCategory is being removed from Alloy for version 1.0.0. Its usage will be replaced by the Ti.Platform.Android.physicalSizeCategory API present in TiSDK 3.0+. Developers have probably never used the module directly, as it was just there to support the Alloy.isTablet and Alloy.isHandheld functions.

<h4>original</h4>

The ti.physicalSizeCategory module is necessary to allow us to handle device queries based on device size on Android. As of this [pull request](<a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/2610)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/2610)</a>, this functionality has been integrated into titanium_mobile. The first version to have this change available, though, will be 2.2.0 (3.0). We have a couple options:

<h4>We could leave it how it is and have ti.physicalSizeCategory added to all apps</h4>
<h4>We could inspect the build details of each app and only add the module for Android apps lower than 2.2 (3.0)</h4>
<h4>Alloy could only support 2.2.0 (3.0) or higher</h4>

Obviously #3 would be the easiest, and may also be necessary for ALOY-210

   I'll talk to Gabe</li>
<li>Tony Lukasavage 2012-08-29

   Yeah, this will essentially be determined by ALOY-211</li>
<li>Russell McMahon 2012-08-31

   Alloy will need to support 2.1 and up so number 3 is out. Number 1 is not good so #2 should be the fix.</li>

   ti.physicalSizeCategory module removed, all uses replaced with Ti.Platform.Android.physicalSizeCategory.</li>
