<h3>Description</h3>

Currently the column names for a SQL migration go through normalization at runtime in the sql.js sync adapter in the <code>SQLiteMigrateDB()</code> function. We should find a way to do this normalization at compile time to improve performance.

   This would require using AST parsing on the model since it is javascript, not JSONm which would lengthen the compile process. Since no one has ever noted the normalization as a performance issue, and it is totally avoidable with proper type naming, I am closing this ticket.</li>
