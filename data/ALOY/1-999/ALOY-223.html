<h3>Description</h3>

In the <code>processIf()</code> function of the <code>Alloy/commands/compile/optimizer.js</code> file, there is a section where it attempts to determine how to process an "if" statement if it is checking for iPhone, iPad, or Universal. At compile time currently, though, there is no distinction between ipad and iphone when a universal build is selected. 

We need to investigate to see if there is a way to make this distinction, and if there is, move these checks to compile time. It's also worth noting that we might want to wait on this one until the new CLI is created: TIMOB-8652

   As suggested let's wait until the new CLI is in place before implementing this.</li>

   As TIMOB-11913 was marked as invalid, this will not be fixed.</li>
