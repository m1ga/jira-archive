<h3>Description</h3>

The calls should be "alloy descriptors widget" and "alloy descriptors sample"

   I think the commands would probably be better name like this, as "descriptors" will not be intuitive to developers:
   
   <code><pre>
   alloy list widget
   alloy list sample
   </pre></code>
   
   "list" is commonly used in many CLI tools, like npm, and will be much easier for developers to recognize and type.</li>

   I agree "list" wins.</li>

   Worked with the Studio team to make sure they had access to templates and the appropriate images and descriptions for them. I will create new tickets if more information is needed regarding widgets and/or samples</li>
