<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>description</h4>

Until zipti is integrated with Titanium Studio, its translation process needs to be run on the commandline through nodejs and then the resulting code needs to be placed in an existing Titanium project. After the code is placed in that existing project, a developer needs to open/access TiStudio and then launch the generated app against the emulator/simulator/device of their choice.

It would be quicker for testing if this could be reduced to 1 step, allowing a dev to deploy right from zipti. We need to investigate if this is a good idea, or if it creates an unnecessary separation from the existing build scripts. Duplicate effort is something we can't afford here.

<h4>proposed usage</h4>

We could add an additional option to the command line execution. For example, we could add <code>-t, --target</code> whose value would correspond to a valid build target. For example, 

<code><pre>
zipti -p -o ~/Titanium\ Studio\ Workspace/myTestProject -t iphone
</pre></code>

Open to alternatives here. Thoughts?

   Sounds good to have a -t flag for running a single command and have the app show. We may also need to specify, device vs simulator and release vs debug. I think for now let's just keep this ticket open as cli stuff with which we will interact is going through changes. I will bring this up with Neeraj to make sure as cli progresses that ZipTi functionality is included.</li>

   The android emulator and ios sim can be launched with jake. Also, the <code>alloy run</code> command makes use of titanium.py, allowing developers to run existing alloy-powered projects.</li>
