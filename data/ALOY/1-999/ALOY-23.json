		"description": "h2. description\r\n\r\nUntil zipti is integrated with Titanium Studio, its translation process needs to be run on the commandline through nodejs and then the resulting code needs to be placed in an existing Titanium project. After the code is placed in that existing project, a developer needs to open/access TiStudio and then launch the generated app against the emulator/simulator/device of their choice.\r\n\r\nIt would be quicker for testing if this could be reduced to 1 step, allowing a dev to deploy right from zipti. We need to investigate if this is a good idea, or if it creates an unnecessary separation from the existing build scripts. Duplicate effort is something we can't afford here.\r\n\r\nh2. proposed usage\r\n\r\nWe could add an additional option to the command line execution. For example, we could add {{-t, --target}} whose value would correspond to a valid build target. For example, \r\n\r\n{code}\r\nzipti -p -o ~/Titanium\\ Studio\\ Workspace/myTestProject -t iphone\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nOpen to alternatives here. Thoughts?",
