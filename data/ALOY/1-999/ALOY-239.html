<h3>Description</h3>

The <code>vendor</code> folder is not documented and simple provides a name-specific way to organize files that would otherwise be stored in libs. To simplify Alloy, let's remove it.

   also removed "modules" test app that relied on "vendor"</li>

   In what way is this folder removed? The compiler still copies vendor folders:

   I can understand this is still there not to break old tests, but if you don't want people to use it at least it should give a warning when you do.</li>

   This has not been removed at all and I'm not sure if we should or maybe even make it official since it's a convention used in many software to hold third party libraries injected by build tools and package managers and thus should be ignored for versioning.
