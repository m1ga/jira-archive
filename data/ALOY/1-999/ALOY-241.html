<h3>Description</h3>

We need to keep getController() as people have started to do Alloy development but we can deprecate it's use. We need to change all the samples and docs including the quick start to reflect the change.

   SOunds perfect. We will need to do the same with the following functions as well:
   
   * Alloy.getModel -> Alloy.createModel
   * Alloy.getCollection -> Alloy.createCollection
   * Alloy.getWidget -> Alloy.createWidget
   
   Can we ask Neeraj what the exact policy is for instituting deprecation? We may not need to do exactly what platform does now, but I think they have a standard method for deprecating things in the API. I think for one 0.1.0 version they mark a property/function as deprecated and log a WARN message in the TiStudio log whenever it is used, indicating that the API in use is deprecated, and which API should be used instead. After that 0.1.0 passes, I believe they remove the deprecated API. 
   
   SO for example, if a 1.8 API was being deprecated, it would still work but show a warning in 1.9.0, and in 2.0 it would have removed the deprecated API entirely. Again, I need confirmation on this though.</li>

   Not just controller we need the following:
   
   Alloy.getController -> Alloy.createController
   Alloy.getModel -> Alloy.createModel
   Alloy.getCollection -> Alloy.createCollection
   Alloy.getWidget -> Alloy.createWidget
   
   Also need to deprecate the existing getX calls. Will work with doc team on how to do this.

   Also make sure the quick start and all test apps are updated and tested as well.</li>
