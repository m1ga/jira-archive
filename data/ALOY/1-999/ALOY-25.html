<h3>Description</h3>

In an effort to protect scope and improve modularization, we will be replacing all <code>eval()</code> calls for the following w3c libraries with commonjs <code>require()</code>. 

* xmlsax.js.opn
* xmlw3cdom.js.opn
* xmlxpath.js.opn

As these libraries were not designed as commonjs modules, some care will have to go into how they are created as such.

   There's also the consideration that these libraries are LGPL, so I'm not entirely certain if we are allowed to change them. And we would almost certainly have to change them as right now there is no means of using them meaningfully with a commonjs module.</li>
