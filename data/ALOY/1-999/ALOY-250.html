<h3>Description</h3>

It seems as though XML formatting errors are being reported in the log, but not aborting the Alloy build process. For example:

<code><pre>
<Alloy>
	<Window32 id="index">
		<Button id="b" class="button" onClick="showAlert">Hello, World!</Button>
	</Window>
</Alloy>
</pre></code>

This causes the following error message to appear in the log:

<code><pre>
end tag name: Window is not match the current start tagName:Window32
</pre></code>

But it does not abort the build until a later error forces it to. These XML errors should be caught when they occur and conveyed to the developer so that they can fix them before the app runs, not simply warn them and have them encounter unexpected behavior.

   I tracked down why we don't get exceptions on malformed XML and only warnings:

   I have logged and issue with xmldom, but I'm not sure how long it will take to get a change in place, if the developer wants to do it at all. We may have to consider forking and submitting a PR, or looking for a XML validator just for this purpose.

   Problem solved, but logged ALOY-267 to continue work towards an even better solution.</li>
