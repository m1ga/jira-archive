<h3>Description</h3>

Since true debugging will need to wait a bit, let's see if we can improve the output from uglifyjs to make it a bit more readable.

   Did more testing, all looks good. This output is probably as good as we are going to get without source mapping alloy code to the generated code. It should allow developers using the runtime debugger to more meaningful step through an application than before when the more intrusive mangling and compression settings were used.</li>
