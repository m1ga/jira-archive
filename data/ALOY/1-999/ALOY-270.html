<h3>Description</h3>

Right now, everything is app/assets is supposed to be straight copied over to the Resources directory.  However, if an asset is changed or removed, the old assets just stay in /Resources.  I bet alloy is just doing a copy, when you really need to do a remove and copy, so that asset folder structure changes are picked up.
