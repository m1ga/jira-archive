		"description": "Right now our HTML parsing is based on grammars written against [peg.js|http://pegjs.majda.cz/], which in turn generates a Javascript HTML parser, which we then use an additional parser on top of to actually start creating our DOM and Titanium code. In addition to all that, we also have a custom selector for traversing and modifying the DOM. The grammars have been custom written by us and we currently have no test suite for testing its validity.\r\n\r\nAn alternative to this method might be to take advantage of [jsdom|https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom], a nodejs package that is a full, relatively mature, one-step DOM creator/parser with integrated selectors (also allows jQuery integration) and a full test suite. It's basically all of the above steps rolled into one and test suite already done. It also covers far more comprehensively the ins and outs of the DOM, with specification, benchmarking, and testing for level 1, 2, and 3. \r\n\r\nMy limited research so far has not shown how exactly we could export this created DOM from our nodejs build environment to the Titanium environment, but even if this is not possible, it would still give a much needed boost in terms of functionality and stability to the parsing currently handled by {{grammar/html.pegjs}} and {{lib/parser/html.js}}. We could still run our own custom parser on top of it, like {{lib/parser/parser.js}}, without the need for creating our own selectors... and doing so in a more standardized format. \r\n\r\nThe goal here is to try and remove the complexity of DOM creation/parsing from our development so that we can focus on how it can be used to create Titanium code.
