<h3>Description</h3>

At the @0.2.34 version we found the platform specific folders for views/styles/controllers and with the formFactor attribute we can develop thinking in specific platform (handheld or tablet). But the Android Platform has 4 groups of screen (LDPI, MDPI, HDPI and XHDPI) and it's a bit hard to build different views for different screen density.

Like @tonylukasavage says, The purpouse of this Issue: be able to use alloy views/controllers/styles not only based on platform, but also in the case of android, based on screen density. Such as the image attached (Screen Shot 2012-09-21 at 8.47.27 AM.png).

It will help us to build apps more flexible for each platform and screen density (in the case of Android). One example for this use:

For LDPI Android screens, we can build screens more focused on the base application task only (in my case an app for soccer lovers) and split the features in other screens/actions, but with HDPI we can use the large height screen and shows more information about the team, players, use images with more details and bigger!

   It would be nice to have this more fragment-based as well.  For instance, I wouldn't necessarily want to have a completely separate view for different densities...but I might want to have different views inside:
   
   <Alloy>
      <Require id="someView" src="someView" density="HDPI" />
   </Alloy>
   
   Likewise, having the flexibility for something in TSS makes sense too:
   
   "#myView[density=HDPI]": {
   
   }
   
   A shortcut for the density in the Alloy namespace makes sense as well (I know it's easy to get in the Ti API's but it makes sense to cache that for Android and access via Alloy).</li>

   @Rick Blalock, your solution sounds good and more looks more simple to implement by TI-ALLOY Dev Team. I'm finishing my iOS UI versions of my app and i'm ready to start my Android UI. This density attribute'll help me save lot of time of coding...</li>

   This will be handled in ALOY-871</li>
