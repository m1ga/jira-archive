<h3>Description</h3>

Developers will likely be expecting the latest stable functionality from underscore.js available in Alloy. We'll need to update and test this. Another ticket should likely be filed to assess this and backbone.js on a regular basis for updates.

<h3>Comments</h3>

   As of November 28, 2012, Alloy is already using Backbone 0.9.2, which is the latest stable version. This will remain unchanged. Backbone will however be switched to the minified production version rather than the development version.
   
   Undescore.js, however, is 1.3.3 in Alloy, but the latest stable in 1.4.2. Alloy will update to use 1.4.2.</li>

   All testing, both unit and functional, has passed. Any issues that may arise as a result of the update will be documented in new tickets.</li>
