<h3>Description</h3>

The first pass at DRYing out the tag parsers went well, but there's still a good bit of improvement and abstraction that can be done. This is important as we would eventually like to expose to developers the ability to create their own parsers. The simpler and more uniform the syntax for creating parsers, the easier that will be. Abstracted "parent" classes for these parsers will make that even easier.

As of now, these parsers need to an initial cleanup that wasn't done in ALOY-306
* Ti.Map.View
* Ti.UI.DashboardView
* Ti.UI.ScrollableView
* Ti.UI.Picker
* Ti.UI.TableView

After those have been cleaned up, we'll need to further abstract some of the parsers that still have very similar functionality, like for example TabGroups, NavigationGroups, DashboardViews, etc...

This should likely make ALOY-109 possible

   These parsers will be refactored as necessary. If a specific ticket is needed for specific changes, one will be created.</li>
