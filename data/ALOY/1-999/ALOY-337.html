<h3>Description</h3>

Allow developers to create themes, which will be deployed based on a name given in the config.json file. We could create a "themes" directory in the app folder. In the "themes" folder can be both the "assets" and "styles" folder. There will be a naming convention for assigning names to these themes. The name of the theme can be used in the config.json to determine which one will be used at compile time. At compile time, the themes styles and assets will overwrite those in the default styles and assets folders.

   themes are confirmed to be working on all platforms. Created "advanced/themes" in the test apps to show the theming functionality.</li>
