					"body": "The only reasonable to do this now would be to inspect the model files and look for the adapters used. Unfortunately since models are defined as JS and not JSON, we'd need to parse the file into AST and look for the adapter type that way. That would defeat the purpose of this ticket which is decreasing the amount of JS files processed as AST. We'll defer this ticket until we can come up with a more creative, faster way to determine which adapters to include.\n\nOne thought would be to add an *adapters* field to the config.json where the developer could specify which adapters the app will use. If the *adapters* field is absent, import all adapters just as we do now.",
