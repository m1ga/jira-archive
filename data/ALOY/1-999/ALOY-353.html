<h3>Description</h3>

Titanium proxies should support the on(), off(), and trigger() Backbone eventing functions. These functions should wire seamlessly into the eventing functions built in to Titanium proxies, meaning:

* on === addEventListener
* off === removeEventListener
* trigger === fireEvent

   In this ticket, a bug was also resolved that was firing event listeners set with *on()* multiple times. The wiring between Backbone eventing and Titanium proxy eventing has been fixed and on(), off(), and trigger() behave as expected when used by proxies. </li>
