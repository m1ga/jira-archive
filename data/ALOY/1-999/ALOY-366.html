<h3>Description</h3>

Would be good to have more insight into what are the most processor intensive sections of the alloy compile process. Will make it easier to focus efforts on speeding up that process. It may not seem critical now, but as the complexity of projects grows and the introduction of rapid deployment techniques (like TiShadow) are introduced, the compile time will more evident.

   Benchmarking is in place and can be used to check where the overhead is in the compile process</li>
