<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Description</h4>

ZipTi needs to have comprehensive logging. This includes logging during translation as well as runtime logging to account for the difficulty in debugging DOM generated code. We need to try to eliminate the inevitable developer pain points that come from an additional layer of abstraction.

<h4>Runtime</h4>

use Ti.API functions for logging to the console. We should probably have a way to control the verbosity of the output.

<h4>Translation</h4>

Use console.log() from node for output.

   Closed because logging concerns have changed drastically since changing to XML/JSON. A new ticket will be created if necessary.</li>
