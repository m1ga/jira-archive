<h3>Description</h3>

The <Collection> tag currently only creates/references a global singleton version of the collection. We need to implement <Collection> such that instances bound to the current controller can be created as well.

<h4>Proposed Syntax</h4>

*NOTE:* <Collection> must always be the child of <Alloy>

<h4>Singleton</h4>
<code><pre>
<!-- "src" is the Alloy Model on which the collection is based -->
<Alloy>
    <!-- Accessible globally as Alloy.Collections.myModel -->
    <Collection src="myModel"/>
</Alloy>
</pre></code>

<h4>Instance</h4>
<code><pre>
<!-- * "src" is the Alloy Model on which the collection is based 
     * "id" works just like it does on UI components, creating a reference
     * "instance" tells Alloy to create an instance instead of a singleton -->
<Alloy>
    <!-- Accessible as $.myModel in corresponding controller -->
    <Collection id="someId" src="myModel" instance="true"/>
</Alloy>
</pre></code>

While a singleton <Collection> would be made available in Alloy.Collections, an instance collection will be attached to the current controller just as a UI component. So the above instance collection would be accessible in controller code like this:

<code><pre>
var collectionInstance = $.someId;
</pre></code>

<h3>Comments</h3>

<li>Tony Lukasavage 2012-11-28

   In the process of creating <Collection> instances, a lot of additional validation and error reporting was added to the Alloy.Collection parser. In addition, the models/todo_binding test app was updated and had a bug or two in it fixed.</li>
