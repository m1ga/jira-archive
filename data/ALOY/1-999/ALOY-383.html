<h3>Description</h3>

We should add an *inViewHierarchy* attribute to the XML markup, that when set to false, would indicate that the view is not to be added to the view hierarchy by Alloy. This would be useful in the case of markup for dialogs, or in the case of special properties that rely on references to titanium proxies. Properties like rightNavButton, leftNavButton, searchbar, etc... More details on these properties can be found in ALOY-382.

   @Fokke, you make a good point that by simply adding the views under <Alloy> that they are automatically not in the view hierarchy. I wanted to have the <code>inViewHierarchy</code> attribute to allow structuring as in ALOY-382, but perhaps abiding by the XML view hierarchy convention would be a bit "purer".</li>

   Let's continue without it, using the modified structure in ALOY-382. This can be revisited if there ever is an additional need that can not be handled by simply making the UI components a child of <Alloy></li>
