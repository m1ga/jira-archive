<h3>Description</h3>

In alloy's early state, it's a good idea to keep the "master" branch as the current path of development for the next release. If a new feature is not going to be ready within the space of a single release, it should be developed in a new "alpha" branch. In the "alpha" branch new development can be a little more relaxed in terms of testing. Also, the development can take place over a longer period of time without impacting the "master". This will be useful for new features that will have a large impact on alloy like model-view binding and dynamic styling. The extra time this code remains in the "alpha" branch can be used to solicit feedback and help mold the beta or final state of the feature.
