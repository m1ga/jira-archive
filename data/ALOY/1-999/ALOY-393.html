<h3>Description</h3>

The optimizer.js was disabled for a short time due to the linked issues. The optimizer.js has since become more stable and covers more of the platform conditional cases that it was meant to. We should re-enable the optimizer.js as part of the runtime JS file optimization process. It should be inserted in the flow of optimizations just before the final ast_squeeze() step. Extensive internal testing should be done to ensure that the optimizer operates as expected and causes no errors in valid JS.

This module will make optimizations at compile time to improve runtime performance. It will attempt to make any runtime platform conditionals into compile time ones, removing the runtime overhead. More performance enhancements to come.

   After passing all existing unit tests, new additional ones that failed before the ALOY-274 fixes, passing all compile unit tests, and running most basic apps, the optimizer.js is in high quality working order with all known edge cases accounted for. The optimizer.js code has been re-enabled and any further issues with it will be addressed in new tickets.</li>
