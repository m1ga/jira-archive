Only a few of the animation functions have completion callbacks, and there doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason as to which ones have them and which don't. We should add callbacks on all of them.

   Initial ticket resolved in ALOY-397. A bug with that, where an app would receive a runtime error if no callback was defined, was solved in this PR: <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/alloy/pull/87" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/alloy/pull/87</a></li>
