		"description": "As it stands, all automatically generated variable names in Alloy get a standard prefix and then a counter as more variables are generated. In other words, the list will always look like this:\r\n\r\n* __alloyId1\r\n* __alloyId2\r\n* __alloyId3\r\n* __alloyId4\r\n* __alloyId5\r\n* and so on...\r\n\r\nWhile this serves its purpose correctly, it makes it difficult in some cases to understand what is going on if a developer decides to inspect the generated code. They can figure it out, but it would be nicer if they could understand it a little more at a glance. \r\n\r\nTo help with this, when the deploy type is either *development* or *test*, I'd like to make the name a little more meaningful. Perhaps adding a part to the variable name that indicates what API it pertains to, or anything to really make it more applicable. In *production* we'll just squeeze these names down to something small and unique, but a more verbose name in *development* and *test* will prove useful.\r\n\r\nFortunately the auto generation of variable names has been abstracted out to a single function called *generateUniqueId()* in https://github.com/appcelerator/alloy/blob/master/Alloy/commands/compile/compilerUtils.js. We can add additional parameters to this function relatively easily and make this improvement gradually, starting with the most used or most cryptic generated code.",
