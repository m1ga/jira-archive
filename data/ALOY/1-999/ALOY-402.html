<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>update (1/23/2013)</h4>

ALOY-485, which depends on TIMOB-12399, is marked as related, but will not be completed for Alloy 1.0.0. This unfortunately leaves collection binding for views in only a seme-stable state for iOS. We may want to consider marking collection binding for views as "experimental" and note the issues in those tickets some where in our Alloy 1.0.0 migration notes. This hasn't changed from 0.3.x, but it hasn't been documented either. 

Collection binding for tableviews, though, works as expected. This only affects collection binding on arbitrary views, as seen in the [models/journal test app](<a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/alloy/tree/master/test/apps/models/journal)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/alloy/tree/master/test/apps/models/journal)</a>

<h4>update (1/21/2013)</h4>

All tickets relevant to further Alloy 1.0.0 changes that should be covered in a migration document will be linked as related tickets.

<h4>description</h4>

We have the following Alloy namespace APIs marked as deprecated:

* - Alloy.getController()
* - Alloy.getModel()
* - Alloy.getCollection() 
* - Alloy.getWidget()
* - Alloy.globals

We need to plan to remove these completely to reduce the size of the runtime file, as well as move developers to what will be the best practices for creating Alloy apps. Typically in TiSDK this process takes much longer, but in the case of Alloy which is still considered beta, I think its safe to move faster and notify developers that these APIs will be removed in Alloy 1.0.0. Warnings will state as much and developers can prepare to move over to the proper development methods.

<h4>additional deprecations</h4>
* - We should also officially remove the deprecated *size* device query, which has been replaced with *formFactor*.
* - remove the datetime.js builtin, as it has been made obsolete by the moment.js builtin
