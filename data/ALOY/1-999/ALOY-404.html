<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>update (1/29/2013)</h4>

A new adapter type was not created. Instead, a test app was created showing how you can use plain old Backbone models and collections and still leverage Alloy data binding. it can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/alloy/tree/master/test/apps/models/binding_no_persistence" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/alloy/tree/master/test/apps/models/binding_no_persistence</a>

<h4>original</h4>

It is assumed that if you are using Alloy Models that you want to use local/remote persistence as well, as the only choices for adapter are sql, properties, and localStorage. We should make an adapter that abides by the normal Alloy Model conventions that has no persistence, an adapter that simply allows devs to take advantage of model-view binding.

The adapter type will likely be "*none*" and will be the default when an adapter is not specified. 

Another consideration is just making plain old backbone models/collections work with Alloy's binding
