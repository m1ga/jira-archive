<h3>Description</h3>

The samples could then be shown in the Studio. Ideally each sample will have its own git repository, e.g. the Titanium samples are in the respective git://github.com/appcelerator-developer-relations/Sample.<name>.git repos.

The apps will be housed in the "templates" folder at the top-level of the alloy folder. The apps will be organized by named folders and contain only the contents of the "app" directory, just as the templates. Alloy will also expose a new "alloy info" option to allot TiStudio to get a listing of sample apps and all important information about them:

<code><pre>
alloy info samples
</pre></code> 

This will return a JSON listing of information just like the "alloy info templates" command
