<h3>Description</h3>

Stripping out all markup that doesn't apply to the currently compiled-for platform will allow us to keep auto-IDing of top-level views when platform conditionals are used in markup, while also allowing us to keep validation that wouldn't work otherwise. We should also do this for future compile-time conditionals, like perhaps TiSDK version.
