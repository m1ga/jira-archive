<h3>Description</h3>

In versions of Titanium prior to 3.0, using the old CLI, when an alloy compilation failed, the build was aborted, as is expected. The new CLI and its hook system, though, don't properly recognize the failure of alloy compilations. This is due mainly to the fact that the new CLI hook requires the direct execution of a script within alloy for compilation, rather than just calling the alloy command.

The new CLI hook needs to add explicit *process.exit(1)* calls at points where it would abort with error in order for the CLI to know to stop the build process.

   Took a little longer than expected to fix and test as I also made sure that the hooks in a project would be updated on every compile, when necessary. This will ensure that the fix makes it into every project.</li>
