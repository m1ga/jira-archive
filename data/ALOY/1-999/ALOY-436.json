The new CLI and its hook system, though, don't properly recognize the failure of alloy compilations. This is due mainly to the fact that the new CLI hook requires the direct execution of a script within alloy for compilation, rather than just calling the alloy command.\r\n\r\nThe new CLI hook needs to add explicit *process.exit(1)* calls at points where it would abort with error in order for the CLI to know to stop the build process.",
