<h3>Description</h3>

When running a local Titanium Alloy framework project inside Titanium Studio that is attached to a SVN subversion repository the Resources directory is not updated with any changes after the build. For more details please see:

   This appears to have been fixed with Alloy 1.0.0 and TiSDK/TiStudio 3.0.2, as stated in the included Q&A link. Will reopen if this is not the case.</li>

   I am not sure if this is same issue, however, from my support forum post today:
   
   When running the Alloy build, the compile process is copying all the the .svn folders from the /app folder and subfolders to the corresponding subfolders in Resources. This is wrecking havoc on my workspace and interaction with SVN when I try to check in real changes.

   [~mike@barontek.com] for the time being, can't you just ignore the Resources folder in your svn settings? The whole folder is generated code so it really shouldn't be in version control anyway.
   
   And yes, this should probably be opened as a new ticket. While it involved svn like this ticket, it's definitely not the same issue.</li>

   Hey Tony,
   I did add it to the ignore list in SVN, however, when the Alloy compile process copies all the .svn folders, Eclipses' SVN plugin see's those subfolders and it looks like it starts messing with the SVN integration.  So, adding it to svn ignore did not help.
   
   It also looks like the Resources folder is deleted each build, which I think then impacts the SVN ignore settings as well.
   
   I will go ahead and open new ticket and look for other work-around.  Thanks.</li>
