<h3>Description</h3>

The details for what the Titanium CLI uses to determine if there's a full rebuild or not is found here: <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/blob/master/iphone/cli/commands/_build.js#L1348" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/blob/master/iphone/cli/commands/_build.js#L1348</a>

It is likely that _not_ deleting and rebuilding the Resources directory on each build will be the root of this issue.

   After testing it turns out that iOS was _not_ performing a full rebuild on every alloy project run. It is only performing them when appropriate. The problem is that currently the new CLI is taking about twice as long to do non-full-rebuilds as did the old python CLI. This is being addressed in TIMOB-12400 and should account for the current slowdown.</li>
