<h3>Description</h3>

As described here: <a href="http://developer.appcelerator.com/question/146873/alloy-require-android-menu-not-possible" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://developer.appcelerator.com/question/146873/alloy-require-android-menu-not-possible</a>

"In short, no, <Require> doesn't work right now for including Android Menus. The primary reason is that the Android Menu requires knowing what its parent node is in order to identify its containing Window, and in turn identify that Window's activity. This will be possible in Alloy, just not at the moment. The quick and dirty workaround is just to put your menu markup in the markup for the Window itself right now.
If you would be so kind, can you create a Titanium Community Jira ticket for this? That way I can get it prioritized and into my schedule ASAP. Be sure to give it the "alloy" label so it makes its way to me."

   Now on tapping Android Menu, shows two options and both the menu options are working fine. Used the test app mentioned in the above link. Note - Observed that when options show, the label "Press the menu button" still shows in background. Tested in below environment -
