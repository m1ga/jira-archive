<h3>Description</h3>

The old "sql" adapter will be replaced with the "sql_new" adapter. The "sql_new" adapter was introduced in Alloy 0.3.5 due to the massive amount of changes and improvements, some of which were not 100% backwards compatible. The linked related tickets show all these changes. The replacement should be made and tested against all test apps.

   This took significantly more testing than expected as all needs to be assessed at runtime and all tset apps were run on at least ios and android where applicable.</li>
