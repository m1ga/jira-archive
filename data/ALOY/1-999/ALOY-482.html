<h3>Description</h3>

When running the models/journal test app, I'm getting a series of this warning in the console:

<code><pre>
[DEBUG] [WARN] Called remove for [object container] on [object scroll], but [object container] isn't a child or has already been removed.
[DEBUG] [WARN] Called remove for [object container] on [object scroll], but [object container] isn't a child or has already been removed.
[DEBUG] [WARN] Called remove for [object container] on [object scroll], but [object container] isn't a child or has already been removed.
</pre></code>

and in the app the entries are not being cleared after the fetch(), causing lots of duplicates to appear in the scrollview. We need to figure out a reliable way to empty all views from a proxy's view hierarchy.

   The problem has been resolved in models/journal test app for ios by refactoring the add.js controller to only trigger binding once per entry, but a deeper problem still exists in iOS TIMOB that can cause this issue to appear in less scrutinized collection binding code for views. This issue has been logged as TIMOB-12399.</li>
