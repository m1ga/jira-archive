		"description": "h2. problem\r\n\r\nThis issue is covered in detail in the related and dependent linked tickets. In brief, iOS remove() calls (used in collection binding for views) are performed asynchronously. If you are doing a \"remove all\" in a loop, this unfortunately means that operations that are performed after those remove() calls may actually be performed before the remove() is complete. This will cause some weird behavior if you are attempting to add views to the view hierarchy directly after the \"remove all\", which collection binding for views does.\r\n\r\nh2. impact\r\n\r\nAny Titanium views that use the typical add()/remove() functions to establish parent/child relationships in the UI will behave unreliably on iOS until TIMOB-12399 is resolved. For the sake of clarity, here is a brief listing of views that would and would not work. The list is not comprehensive, but a few examples should make it more readily apparent exactly what this issue impacts:\r\n\r\n* Will work\r\n** Ti.UI.ScrollableView, as it uses *views* to establish its view hierarchy\r\n** Ti.UI.TableView, as it uses *data* to establish its rows\r\n** Ti.UI.ListView (in Alloy 1.2.0) as it uses *sections* to establish its sections\r\n** Other UI components with special APIs for managing views (Buttonbar, TabbedBar)\r\n* Will not work (as it uses add()/remove())\r\n** Ti.UI.View\r\n** Ti.UI.ScrollView\r\n** Ti.UI.Window\r\n** Essentially any UI component that does not have a special API for managing views contained within it\r\n\r\nh2. notes\r\n\r\nEven after this ticket is resolved, TiSDK 3.2.0 or greater will be required for this to work in Alloy.",
