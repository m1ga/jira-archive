   Huh, looks like I can't edit a ticket after creating it. Oh well. Check out TIMOB-12594 for more details, but the gist is this: studio needs a way to get the changelog for some specific version. We are going to solve this by dumping the changelog in package.json, and we are going to create a script to automate this process.</li>

   OK, so I'll watch TIMOB-12594 to determine how to apply it to this ticket.</li>

   I think this ticket should be resolved as invalid, since we decided to go with the git tagging approach instead (the parent ticket was resolved invalid).</li>
