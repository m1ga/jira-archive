<h3>Description</h3>

Currently, far too many DOM-related exceptions will return with both the filename and line number of the exception being undefined. This makes it very difficult to debug apps. Part of this stems from the use of <code>eval()</code> for loading our XML scripts. We need to investigate further to see other causes of these vague errors and find ways to meaningfully express them to developers.

   eval() has been removed. Additional logging tickets are sub-tasks of [ZIPTI-19]</li>
