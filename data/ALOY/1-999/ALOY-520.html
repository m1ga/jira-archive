<h3>Description</h3>

"jake app:run" does a full rebuild of every test app when executed. It would be nice, now that Alloy supports "app:quickrun" builds with ios and fastdev with android, if we could also support quick builds with jake. For deep testing, it would be a good idea to do full rebuilds, but for quick testing, this will increase the speed of the development workflow.

   Quick runs can now be done with 
   
   <code><pre>
   jake app:quickrun dir=basics/simple
   </pre></code>
   
   but a full run needs to be done first. This works well with iOS, but not so much with Android as fastdev would need to be run manually. Integrating fastdev into the alloy testing workflow is not something we want to tackle and will likely wait for liveti to be ready before revisiting speeding up the testing workflow further. </li>
