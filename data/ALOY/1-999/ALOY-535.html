<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>update (2/25/2013)</h4>

The new syntax will be, allowing for the existing syntax as well as allowing for a prepared statement to be defined with an object.

<code><pre>
// plain query
collection.fetch({
    query: 'select * from some_table where column1 = "somevalue"'
});

// prepared statement
collection.fetch({
    query: {
        statement: 'select * from some_table where column1 = ?',
        params: [values]
    }
});
</pre></code>

<h4>original</h4>

Currently there is no support for prepared statements.  The only way to make an SQL statement with parameters is to have code insert the parameters.  This is a security risk, a bad practice, and reflects poorly on Alloy models as a whole.

Currently I have to: 

collection.fetch({query: "select * from some_table where column1 = '" + value + "'");

Ideally I would like to:

collection.fetch({query: "select * from some_table where column1 = ?" + params: [value]});

Assuming this uses the Ti.Database.execute() in the background, this should be a small change as the execute() method already supports this.

   The proposed syntax doesn't make much sense, in that it's using inline concatenation of arguments, making it look like some kind of string:
   
   <code><pre>
   collection.fetch({
       query: "select * from some_table where column1 = ?" + params: [value]
   });
   </pre></code>
   
   I'm assuming you meant something like this:
   
   <code><pre>
   collection.fetch({
       query: "select * from some_table where column1 = ?",
       params: [value]
   });
   </pre></code>
   
   I like the idea of keeping the query and args contained in a single property of the fetch object though, to keep them clearly coupled as fetch can have other arguments:
   
   <code><pre>
   collection.fetch({
       query: {
           statement: "select * from some_table where column1 = ?",
           params: [values]
       }
   });
   </pre></code></li>

   You're correct in your assumption, I intended a comma instead of a plus sign.  However, I do like your proposal better.  Thank you.</li>
