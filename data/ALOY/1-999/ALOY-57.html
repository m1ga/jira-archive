<h3>Description</h3>

Need to make sure alloy works on all of Titanium's supported platforms

* windows
* mac osx
* linux

All basic commands and operations should be verified on these platforms. Additional code will likely be necessary to support Linux and Windows, particularly Windows.

   Subtask is ALOY-85. Since there is a major rewrite of CLI to node for the Titanium SDK it does not make sense to do too much here. I will test the Alloy command-line build on Windows. If errors I'll open separate tickets.</li>

   Do this post "pre-release". For end of July release it's OSX only.</li>

   We should probably re-evaluate the importance of this ticket since the pre-release has landed and we are already getting questions like this:

   need to work on the compiler plugin for windows, need better searching for alloy</li>
<li>Tony Lukasavage 2012-09-28

   All Alloy functionality has been run successfully on Mac OSX, Windows 7 and Ubuntu 12.04. Any additional feedback resulting in further compatibility work will be logged in new tickets on a case by case basis.</li>
