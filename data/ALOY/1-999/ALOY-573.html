<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Steps to reproduce</h4>

1. Download and import <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator-training/tcd_training/tree/master/labcode/Starting/07_networking" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator-training/tcd_training/tree/master/labcode/Starting/07_networking</a>
2. Build the project

<h4>Expected results</h4>

App would compile. 

<h4>Actual results</h4>

Because app.js is generated from the alloy code, it shouldn't be necessary. However, the downloaded project doesn't include such a file and the app will not build.

Work around: create a Resources/app.js file. It doesn't have to have anything in it.

May relate to ALLOY-377

   this should probably be moved to a TIMOB ticket. Alloy doesn't have any control over that part of the process, the CLI fails before Alloy is invoked. There might already bea ticket for this but I'm not sure where it is.</li>

   looks like this was resolved in TIMOB-12722 and should be fixed in TiSDK 3.1.0</li>
