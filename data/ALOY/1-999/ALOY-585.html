<h3>Description</h3>

While the new Ti.UI.ListView UI component can be used in Alloy like this:

<code><pre>
<Alloy>
    <Window>
        <ListView id="list"/>
    </Window>
</Alloy>
</pre></code>

but this forces me to put all the necessary ListView UI creation in my JS controller code. This is only one step removed essentially from coding the whole thing traditionally. We need to actually create markup integration for the ListView and its templates to allow developers to define them much more easily. 

Proposed syntax will be forthcoming as more research is done on the ListView component itself. References being used to learn about the ListView are:

* [KitchenSink ListView samples](<a href="https://github.com/appcelerator-developer-relations/KitchenSink/tree/master/Resources/ui/common/baseui/listview)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator-developer-relations/KitchenSink/tree/master/Resources/ui/common/baseui/listview)</a>
* [ListView spec on the wiki](<a href="https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/community/Titanium+ListView+Specification)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/community/Titanium+ListView+Specification)</a>
* [YAML spec](<a href="https://gist.github.com/bryan-m-hughes/4677555)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://gist.github.com/bryan-m-hughes/4677555)</a>

Additional considerations:

* Data binding will need to be implemented
* Many parsers will likely need to be written as ListView makes use of non-View object literals for templates and sections. Since these are not standard Titanium components, they will require extra effort to parse.
* Must work for both Android and iOS. Alloy's generated code will undoubtedly surface parity issues between the two so time for logging issues back to TIMOB needs to be accounted for.
