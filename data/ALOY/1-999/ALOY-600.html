   Alloy's current inheritance is fairly limited, and there's a few things in the sample code that are not supported:
   
   * Inheritance involving any UI in the derived class
   * Inheritance involving markup events (a subset of the first point)
   
   That said, deferring event handlers to an derived class can still be achieved with a bit of a deeper understanding of he inheritance possibilities that Alloy does in fact provide. Below is a test case that should show you how to do so, which comments interspersed to make clear why things are done a certain way. I'm putting it in a gist as it includes a number of files and it would be messy to include it all here:

   Running that example will allow Alloy to make use of an inherited event handler, albeit in a slightly more complex manner.</li>
