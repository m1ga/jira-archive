<h3>Description</h3>

We use regular user Windows account at work and I find imposible to make Alloy install properly under Windows. How to recreate a bug:

1. Log to regular user account
2. Install node.js as administrator (Run as...)
3. Install Titanium Studio as administrator (Run as...)
4. No profit :( You won't be able to create Alloy project. It will not install properly. Even installing from command line doesn't help

Make the same steps being loged on administrator acccout and it works.

   Can you show what you do from the command line that doesn't work, and what are the exact errors?</li>

   I can't tell what were errors exactly. You were not able to create new alloy project. It was invisible in the project creator. I can't repeat cause in the meantime I changed OS to Windows 7 and under it all is working fine. Only problem is under XP.</li>

   Win7 is the minimum supported Windows OS for Titanium anyway, as per the [Titanium Compatibility Matrix](<a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/2.0/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/2.0/#</a>!/guide/Titanium_Compatibility_Matrix-section-29004837_TitaniumCompatibilityMatrix-OperatingSystem)</li>
