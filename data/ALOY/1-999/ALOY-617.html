<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Improvement description</h4>

Currently the debugger is supporting only .js files included in the 'Controller' folder.

Studio Debugger should also support views .XML files - users should be able to add breakpoints when defining Titanium Objects in Views .xml files.

<h4>Update</h4>

Source Map would be used also from other features that needs mapping to Alloy .XML files, like the Code Analyzer.

   This seems like it would be a very confusing workflow - where would the breakpoint exist? In the resources JS? or would it stop on the XML - what would the step into/over proceed to? the next XML tag? 
   
   Before diving into this, i think it would be a good idea to get a better idea of the workflow and use case?</li>
