		"description": "Currently Alloy has coverage for all of its commands to various degrees. One area that could use more low-level unit tests is the compile command. Currently the compile command is tested by ensuring that all test apps are compiled correctly. This means that the result is not verified, only that it executed without error.\r\n\r\nIn order to better assess the stability of Alloy, we should be inspecting the results of the compile command to ensure that the generated code is as we would expect. This will involve testing the generated controllers as a whole, but will also include low-level testing of generated styles as well. This will make it much more likely that we are covering as much as we can with alloy. \r\n\r\nAlso, it wouldn't hurt to have another complex test app or two.",
