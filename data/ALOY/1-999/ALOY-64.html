<h3>Description</h3>

Currently we only support a subset of CSS selectors. We need to be able to handle child \(>\), grouping (,), siblings \(+\), and pseudo classes \(:\) as well

<h4>Update</h4>

We will likely support only ID, class, and possibly CSS attribute selectors in the first pass.

   I thought Sizzle handled these?

   It does, but not until we get the CSS from the generated parser's format into one that Sizzle can actually handle. We can select elements with <code>$Ti</code> right now with any selector, but we can't apply CSS in the same fashion yet.</li>
<li>Tony Lukasavage 2012-05-22

   The core of the problem lies in the fact that we are specifying styles in CSS format, not JSON as they are used, which requires us to run them through the CSS generated parser before using them. The JSON output of the generated parser is not usable by itself, it needs to be converted to a form to which we can apply Sizzle before it's useful.</li>

   Okay understood. For pseudo selector like lang and after:content we probably need to spec out, after:content is cool but I'm not sure appropriate for Titanium API.</li>
<li>Tony Lukasavage 2012-05-30

   In light of our recent talks on CSS, the currently supported CSS notation is by id (#myId) or by class (#myClass). I'd also like to create a default, low priority selectors for <code>data-ti-api</code> types.  For example:
   
   <code><pre>
   /* by id */
   <h4>myId {</h4>
       /* list of css properties */
   }
   
   /* by class */
   .myClass {
       /* list of css properties */
   }
   
   /* by api type */
   [data-ti-api="Label"] {
       -ti-color: '#fff';
   }
   </pre></code></li>

   no longer using CSS </li>
