<h3>Description</h3>

To prepare for dynamic styling (ALOY-210) a lot of changes are going to be made to how styling is handled in Alloy, referenced in the linked tickets below. In order to ensure that we minimize the chance of regressions during this process, a suite of unit tests regarding specifically the styling should be created. This will allow us to confirm expected behavior as the styling code is abstracted in a way that will make it usable by Titanium at runtime.

The testing should be relatively low-level, allowing us to test specific existing functions in the styling process, but it should also run against the test apps and assert that the generated code matches our expectations of how the styles should be processed.

   Finished writing compile and run time testing for all test apps in "basics" and "advanced". Further unit testing backfill will be addressed in future tickets.</li>
