<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Problem description</h4>
Android 'fastdev' feature is not working as expected on Alloy projects.

1. Create a new Alloy project
2. Build/run on Android emulator
3. Modify a UI element in the project (for example, a label)
4. Close project on Android
5. Open again project on the emulator (manually)

Result: code is not changed
Expected result: code is being updated with the changes made

   Is the expectation here that as soon as you make a change to an Alloy file that fastdev will immediately pick it up? Also, what do you mean by open it again "manually"? The steps above aren't entirely clear to me. </li>

   There was a misunderstanding on the FastDev expected behavior.
   This can be closed as invalid.</li>
