<h3>Description</h3>

For Studio integrations, we need to be able to store meta-data about the Alloy components, ie
<code><pre>
<Alloy>
	<Window class="container">
		<Label id="label" onClick="doClick" data-studio-id="323112">Hello, World</Label>
	</Window>
</Alloy>
</pre></code>

This is similar to what HTML5 provides, so there appears to be other use cases for it

   Can you provide more details on this? Is the request still valid? What is the use-case? Does the ID need to be unique per app, per build, per developer, globally? Does the ID need to be numeric, sequential, a GUID/hex string?</li>

   [~pinnamuri] Is this still something Studio needs? If so, can you answer the questions above?</li>

   I don't know where did this request originated from. However, I don't think we would require this additional property specific to Studio at this moment, and  that doesn't sounds right to me (unless I get to know the original use case).
   
   I would shelve this to backlog and we can prioritize it as we discover the real need for this :-)</li>
