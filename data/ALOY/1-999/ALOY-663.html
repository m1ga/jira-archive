<h3>Description</h3>

All sample and test apps associated with the Alloy repository currently work with the Android, iOS, and Mobileweb platforms, or at the very least have graceful messages and failures where a particular platform does not work. The same needs to be achieved for Blackberry. This will likely serve to surface a number of Titanium-level issue with Blackberry.

   First step is to enable the sample project to include blackberry as a target possibly in the tiapp.xml</li>

   In windows we have Mocha test and native (c++) test so the old BB tests are not required.</li>
