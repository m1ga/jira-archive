<h3>Description</h3>

In 3.1.x - Alloy debugging works for controllers (e.g. set a breakpoint and it stops correctly in a controller) but doesn't stop at any breakpoints for widgets.

   [~rblalock] do you have more details on the conditions to cause this? Was there a particular version of Studio, SDK, Alloy, or CLI that was involved?</li>
<li>Rick Blalock 2013-05-22

   Titanium Studio, build: 3.1.0.201304151600
   Alloy 1.1.2
   Ti SDK 3.1 GA</li>

   Also, I'll add that debugging does not work for JS files in /lib/ either.</li>

   Map files are already created. It's likely that this ticket is caused by TISTUD-4237 and will be resolved when that one is resolved.</li>
