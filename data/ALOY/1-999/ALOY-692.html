<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Problem description</h4>
When building using TiSDK < 3.0.0 , the error message displayed on console is not complete on Windows

<h4>Steps</h4>
Build a project with Alloy 1.0.0 and TiSDK 2.1.4 
Expected result: build fails with error message:
<code><pre>
[ERROR] Alloy 1.0.0+ requires Titanium SDK 3.0.0 or higher.
[ERROR] Version "2.1.4.GA" was found in the "sdk-version" field of your tiapp.xml.
[ERROR] If you are building with the old titanium.py script and are specifying an SDK version 
[ERROR] as a CLI argument that is different than the one in your tiapp.xml, please change the
[ERROR] version in your tiapp.xml file. 
[ERROR] Alloy compile failed
</pre></code>

Result: on Windows machines, the error message is not complete. However it still contains the first line which include the main information.
<code><pre>
[ERROR] Alloy 1.0.0+ requires Titanium SDK 3.0.0 or higher.
[ERROR] Alloy compile failed
</pre></code>

On OS X and Linux machines is displayed correctly

   Federico, based on the logged work on this ticket, I found that this only occurs to the output when run through TiStudio. You should likely make this a TISTUD ticket to make them aware of it. The attached images show it working correctly in the CLI, truncating the output in TiStudio.</li>

   I was able to reproduce this and track down the source of the problem. Alloy's plugin.py has a check_output() function that subprocesses the Alloy CLI. It appears the problem occurs when a build fails and control is returned to the Python script where it detects the error, but doesn't seem to flush the output from the subprocess. I tinkered with it and couldn't get it to output, but that's probably more of a factor of my lack of Python knowledge.
   
   You can either elect to fix it -or- wait until the new Android build is done and rip out all of this legacy Python stuff.</li>

   [~cbarber] There is roughly a 99.9999999997% chance that I'll wait. :)</li>

   [~tlukasavage], good idea! :)</li>

   Since Alloy 1.2.0, only TiSDK 3.0.0+ is supported.</li>
