<h3>Description</h3>

We could expand the validation asked for in ALOY-682, to do detect using the same ID any multiple view elements (which causes conflicts).

This seems like an easy thing to do, but as [Tony points out](<a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/alloy/pull/140#issuecomment-18973129)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/alloy/pull/140#issuecomment-18973129)</a>, conditional view elements make it more challenging.

   Considering the runtime conditionals make this pretty much impossible, since we can't determine whether they are valid or not until runtime, I'd rather not implement this as a complex, incomplete solution. If this turns out to be a major issue, we can revisit, but for now I'm going to close this.</li>

   Totally understand.
   
   Something related that I don't know a ticket exists for is that the existing warning is also given when the root element manually has been given a different then default ID. It will then still warn if child elements use an ID named after the controller.</li>
