<h3>Description</h3>

Currently to use certain proxy properties in markup, like <RightNavButton>, the element itself is used only as a container for the actual element to be rendered. For example, to show a button, you'd need to do this:

<code><pre>
&lt;RightNavButton&gt;
    &lt;Button title="press me"/&gt;
&lt;/RightNavButton&gt;
</pre></code>

but it would be easier to render it as a button if you don't have any child elements:

<code><pre>
&lt;RightNavButton title="press me"/&gt;
</pre></code>

This is just one example. We need to investigate the current list of proxy properties and see which can also be treated in a similar manner.

   Components with leftNavButton / rightNavButton proxy properties that accept arbitrary Views:
   
    * leftNavButton / rightNavButton -- Window, SplitWindow, Popover
   
   Map annotations have leftButton and leftView properties (and corresponding right button/view), which serve a similar purpose though they're not implemented with a single proxy property in the same way. Though, those properties are mutually exclusive -- you have have a button or view, not both. So perhaps Alloy shorthands could be applied to them in the same way.

   Test app: test/apps/testing/ALOY-714
   
   Functional test:
   
   1. Build the app for iOS 
   2. The navigation bar in the resulting app should have left & right navigation buttons. The left was created with standard markup, the right with the <RightNavButton> shorthand notation
   3. Click both buttons, each should display an alert box.</li>
