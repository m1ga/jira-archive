		"description": "For Android, there is often conditional UI code based on the presence/absence of Action Bar capabilities. I find myself doing this manually on very single window, and it's a chore (e.g. configure the action bar in my controller code, or set up an action bar lookalike for API <= 10).... It would be great to add to the \"platform=...\" flags something along the line of \"android-api-lte10\" and \"android-api-gt10\" for views and styles.\r\nEdit: the Android API level is determined at runtime, and the platform view/style attribute is used at build. So to generalize this request - what we really need is a runtime view/style conditional attribute, e.g. \"condition = someVariable\", where someVariable would be set at controller init, e.g. in my case it would be someVariable = Ti.Platform.Android.API_LEVEL <= 10 for a pre-Action Bar window header.",

Not sure if it's a must, but perhaps it should be mirrored there, as done today for \"platform\".\r\nThe use case I have today is indeed for Android Action Bars, where I like to have them where possible, and provide a view look-alike on 2.x. However, since this is done at runtime, why not just make it a generic conditional? Could be useful in many other cases as well.",

With that change, you can use the custom conditionals (with conditions defined in alloy.js as properties of Alloy.Globals) to accomplish the XML example you gave above. Those globals would also accomplish the controller code you show, though because those are evaluated at run time, non-matching branches can't be optimized out like the compile-time OS_* globals. Finally, Titanium 3.3 will include the AppCompat library to support the ActionBar on pre-ICS devices.\r\n\r\nIs there more to your request or could this be considered resolved by the other ticket and closed?",
