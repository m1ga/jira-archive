<h3>Description</h3>

All Javascript code in Alloy should pass through jslint without errors. The only exceptions to this rile should be builtins or other JS code that is managed by external authors.

<h4>exclusion</h4>

* non-Appcelerator builtins (i.e, moment.js, backbone.js, etc...)
* generated JS files (i.e., tss.js TSS grammar file)
* jasmine.js from the "test/lib" folder
* apps in the "test/app/testing" folder

<h4>other notes</h4>

There are a few exceptions that will be handled later in jslint as well. In particular a few of the following "errors" will cause arguably less readability in the code:

* Redefinition of NAME (simply when assigning a module require to a variable)
* Don't make functions within a loop (no anonymous functions with underscore in loops?!)

   These were coding standard changes. Functional testing can be confirmed simply by all automated unit tests passing.
