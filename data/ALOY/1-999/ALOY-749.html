<h3>Description</h3>

The oauth builtin has been disabled in the "unstable" folder for many versions of Alloy now. There have been no requests for this specific functionality to be added into the builtins. Therefore, the builtin will be removed as it represents unnecessary bloat.

   A builtin has been removed that was never in use. There should be no functional testing necessary. The running of the automated unit tests should assert that no adverse effects have occurred.
