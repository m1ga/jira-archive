<h3>Description</h3>

Alloy's theming-feature is awesome when it comes to branding white-label apps.

However, these white-label apps often also require some contact information and stuff like that to change for each distribution. The most logical place to put these, would be the <code>config.json</code> file. And even for styling, setting some base colors in <code>config.json</code> to use in the TSS is often more efficient then overwriting each color using themed <code>.tss</code> files.

The problem however is... <code>config.json</code> does not support themes.

How about adding support to put a <code>config.json</code> in your <code>/app/themes/myTheme</code> folder, which then would (deep-)extend the base <code>config.json</code> file?

   As a workaround, you can copy the compiled <code>Resources/alloy/CFG.js</code> to your <code>app/themes/myTheme/assets/alloy/CFG.js</code> and make any changes there.
   
   But of course this would require you to sync changes in <code>config.json</code> to the themed <code>CFG.js</code> files.</li>

   The PR as it stands now is causing failures with existing apps and test. Specifically, advanced/themes sample app, and tests ALOY-577 and ALOY-629 fail when built using this PR.
   
   <code><pre>
   jake app:run dir=advanced/themes
   
   // throws
   [DEBUG] [ERROR] Error processing "config.json"
   [DEBUG] [ERROR] ENOENT, no such file or directory '/Users/tpoulsen/repos/alloy/test/projects/Harness/app/themes/green/config.json'
   [DEBUG] [ERROR] Alloy compiler failed
   </pre></code></li>

   [~skypanther] fixed it in the PR.</li>
<li>Tim Poulsen 2014-03-13

   The latest PR passes all tests except ALOY-887 which deliberately includes an unclosed comment. That was fixed in PR 312, which must not be present in your branch.</li>

   Are you saying it is OK or needs another fix?</li>
<li>Tim Poulsen 2014-03-13

   It should be handled fine when Tony merges your PR. I think it's OK as-is.</li>
