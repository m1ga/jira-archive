<h3>Description</h3>

Right now Alloy controllers are recompiled on every Alloy compile, regardless of whether or not their source files changed. We should intelligently determine based on associated views, controllers, and styles whether or not a runtime controller needs to be recompiled on any given <code>alloy compile</code>, with the end goal of reducing compile time.

   Please implement this feature. It really will save development time.</li>

   ALOY-1216 is a step in the right direction on this ticket. What that change doesn't do is track which source files are changed and compile only them. However, it will help speed LiveView / TiShadow type systems by supporting the recompilation of specific files.</li>
