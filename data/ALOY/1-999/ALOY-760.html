<h3>Description</h3>

When Alloy generates files and deploys them to the Resources folder, it does not make use of the platform-specific folders. It should do so in the future to allow multiple platforms to run together and to be deployed to successfully. This will be useful for liveview and tishadow.

   Functional testing can be confirmed by running the automated tests. In addition, I'd suggest running any complex alloy apps we have at our disposal for multiple platforms. Be sure to switch between the platforms multiple times to ensure that the platform-specific files are be created during the appropriate builds.</li>

   Tested on iPad with TiSDK 3.2.0.v20131022171645. iOS is now using the platform-specific commonjs files on devices as expected.</li>
