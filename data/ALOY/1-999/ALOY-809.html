<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Description of the problem</h4>
Due to a recent chance in the way event listeners in the view are added (using try/catch instead of the ternary operator), the debugger is now suspending the flow when the app starts, because of the handled exception.

<h4>Steps to reproduce</h4>
1) Create new Alloy project
2) open index.xml and replace "doClick" with "exports.doClick"
3) open index.js and replace "function doClick(e)" with "exports.doCLick = function(e)"
4) Run the app

The resulting file will contain:

<code><pre>
try {
        $.__views.label.addEventListener("click", exports.doClick);
} catch ( e ) {
        __defers["$.__views.label!click!exports.doClick"] = true;
}
</pre></code>

Previously, this was handled using a ternary operator, thus avoiding the try/catch.

   The try/catch method was implemented in order to allow arbitrary namespacing and JS in general to be used for identifying event handlers from markup. It resolved issues that were a problem with the prior method, resolved in ALOY-665. It is also noted that the user found a workaround for their particular situation. Finally, you can disable the behavior where Studio stops on exceptions by changing the setting like this:
   
   * Open Studio
   * Go to "Preferences -> Studio -> Javascript Debug"
   * Uncheck the "suspend" options until the desired behavior is met.
   
   Given the above, I'm going to close this ticket.</li>
