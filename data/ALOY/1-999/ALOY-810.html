<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Steps to reproduce</h4>
1) create an app in Appcelerator Studio
2) move the app's directory into a different path (~/Downloads/)
3) open the new path in console
4) alloy compile --config platform=ios

<h4>Actual result</h4>
Compilation fails with this error:

~~~
[ERROR] Alloy "app" directory does not exist at "/Users/dcassenti/Downloads/app"
~~~

Running the same command when the app is in the workspace works; same happens if - instead of creating a new app - I do:

1) download someone's app in ~/Downloads/
2) open the app's main directory
3) alloy compile --config platform=ios

   I checked the alloy source, actually the problem is different. It fails if you have a tiapp.xml in the parent folder (in my case, I had one ~/Downloads/tiapp.xml). Not sure if this might be considered an issue or not.</li>

   Alloy's just doing its best to find what you are trying to compile. It sees a tiapp.xml and an app folder, so it thinks it found it. I think it's fair to expect developers to call the compile form the appropriate folder.</li>

   Closing as invalid. If this is incorrect, please reopen.</li>
