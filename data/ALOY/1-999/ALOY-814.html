<h3>Description</h3>

Since version 1.2.1 Alloy is throwing errors like:
{color:red} 
Script Error Couldn't find module: alloy/widgets/sc.Weather/controllers/widget
{color}

When I check the Resources directory, not all widgets have been compiled and copied to the Resources directory.

I created a test app, where I created 2 Widgets using the New -> Alloy Widget menu shortcut and added them to the index controller:

<code><pre>
function doClick(e) {
    alert($.label.text);
}

$.index.open();

Alloy.createWidget('wz.MenuBarButton');
Alloy.createWidget('wz.StreamItem');
</pre></code>

The widgets are completely left untouched, so is all other code except for the index controller.

Downgrading to Alloy 1.2.0 solves the issue.

The test app can be found here: <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1849335/AppcJira/tv.wappzapp.alloy121test.zip" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1849335/AppcJira/tv.wappzapp.alloy121test.zip</a>

   [~timanrebel] I can't reproduce the issue using Alloy 1.2.1 and TiSDK 3.1.2. I took the app that you attached and ran it via:
   
   <code><pre>
   ti build -p ios
   </pre></code>
   
   Can you provide more exact details on your environment and _exactly_ how you created the test app and caused the problem? Please list:
   
   * Alloy version
   * TiSDK version
   * Studio version, if you're using it to create the issue
   * Your computer's operating system
   * The _exact_ steps you took to create this test case
   
   Once I have these details I can re-open this ticket and try again.</li>

   Hi Tony:
   
   Alloy version: 1.2.1 (Installed with sudo nom install -g alloy)
   TiSDK version: 3.1.2GA
   Studio version: 3.1.2.201308091617
   Your computer's operating system: OS X 10.9 Mavericks
   The exact steps you took to create this test case:
   * In Titanium I chosse New -> Mobile Project -> Default Alloy Project. I than added 2 widgets via [Ricght Mouse click] New -> New Alloy Widget. After adding 2 widgets I compiled the app via Run -> iPhone Simulator in the App Explorer pane.
   
   I initially encountered this behaviour in both our Snowciety project as WappZapp's project. I cleared both build and Resources directory.
   
   Running <code>ti build -p iOS</code> from the CLI also does not help. Check the output and can't find any errors</li>

   I'm still not able to reproduce. Hate to do this to you, but the only variable I see here is OSX 10.9. Any chance you can run this on a supported OS.</li>

   Really weird and in case it is Mavericks my apologies. I'll try and run the test case on one of the other computers at the office</li>
