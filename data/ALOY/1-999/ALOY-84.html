<h3>Description</h3>

Model generation still makes the assumption that alloy files consist only of an app.js. Therefore, models are only generated into the index component object.

There's a few things that can be remedied here.

* Models should not be dumped as variables into component objects. They should be generated into their own commonjs modules. Those modules will be housed in <code>Resources/alloy/models</code> at runtime.
* It would be nice if the models were accessible from the <code>Alloy</code> namespace. Perhaps as <code>Alloy.Models.MODEL_NAME</code>
* Models will be made accessible, as needed, from all component objects via require() or the Alloy namespace.
* Models will than be able to make changes in multiple parts of the application, not just the current component object.
