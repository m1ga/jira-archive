<h3>Description</h3>

Current problems with ti.alloy plugin:

* Will not work on Windows
* nodejs path is hard-coded to <code>/usr/local/bin/node</code>
* alloy path is hard-coded to <code>/usr/local/bin/alloy</code>

These would be fairly easy to solve, but it appears as though compiler plugins launched through TiStudio do not have full access to the user's environment variables. My own $PATH is pretty large, but when inspected in the compiler plugin, it returns only

<code><pre>/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin</pre></code>

So we need a more reliable way to configure this plugin until we have true Titanium Studio integration. Either that or we continue to post workarounds as users encounter issues.

   Something to consider is the CLI rewrite and upcoming TiStudio integration that would eliminate much of these issues. How much effort do we want to put into improving something that may soon be obsolete?</li>

   Probably this is a post pre-release issue. Unless it is super simple to fix. There are also issues of how  if we fix up python scripts how are we going to distribute with alloy, if we have developers override exiting build scripts we could introduce build regression not tested by QA.</li>

   Dependency has been resolved. Need to determine the minimum version this will be available in for TiStudio and code around that accordingly.</li>
