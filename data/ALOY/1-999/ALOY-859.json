Please note that the Mavericks GM seed was used.\n\nFor this ticket we used the GM Mavericks, and ran alloy compiles successfully in the following configs:\nStudio 3.2.0 + CLI 3.2.0 + Alloy 1.2.2 + SDK 3.1.3.GA\nStudio 3.1.3 + CLI 3.2.0 + Alloy 1.2.2 + SDK 3.1.3.GA\nStudio 3.1.4 + CLI 3.2.0 + Alloy 1.2.2 + SDK 3.1.3.GA\nStudio 3.1.3 + CLI 3.1.2 + Alloy 1.2.2 + SDK 3.1.3.GA\n\nQE is not using 3.1.5 currently, since previously tested was 3.1.4 and current development is on 3.2.0. We are downloading and trying this config anyhow to see if we can reproduce the fail case.\n\n",

					"body": "Hello all, we have had our IT guys set up a windows 2008 server, and after multiple visits, we have a running server with shared drive. We have been trying over the last few days to get Studio to recognize the workspace with no success. We tried creating a folder from the Mac on the shared drive and that works. Specification of that folder as the workspace fails and Studio quits with no log info. We tried copying over an existing workspace and then using that. Same failure. In both cases a metadata folder with a .lock file is created, so writing is not an issue.\r\n\r\nIf anyone who has successfully configured this way has any tips for us, the QE team would greatly appreciate it.

All three, and only these files, end up with multiple NUL characters appended at the end after the build process. The error reported initially on this ticket is being thrown during the CLI build phase. It seems likely that the NULs are being added during Alloy's compile phase when these files are copied to the Resources directory.\n\nI've unsuccessfully tried replacing the file-copy function under the assumption that somehow bytes beyond the end-of-file marker were getting written to the files. I've used a hex editor to confirm that the source files do not contain any extraneous characters. Commenting out the code that copies the sync adapters \"fixes\" the problem.\n\nThis is not related to Studio. I have been working at the command line and getting the same errors.",
