<h3>Description</h3>

Jira ticket for adding a bulk style setter and getter - we should watch this and if it appears performance is bad with setting individual styles we may need to up this tickets priority.  

We want to be able to specify styles specific to the current platform and/or form factor, much like media queries on the web. To do so, we have 2 options

<h4>use separate files sporting a specific convention to identify platform and/or form factor</h4>
<h4>use "selectors" of some kind in the style files themselves</h4>

These methods are detailed in the sub-tasks related to this issue

   I think both options will be needed for GA but probably doing the selectors is more of a priority. Since this has a runtime component and could bring up issues that right now are unforeseen.</li>

   The high priority and due date is for the selector approach. The styles in separate directories have less priority.</li>

   Alloy-89 which applies queries to apply styles from platform files instead of components styles still could probably a post pre-realse item. Alloy-88 the more common "media query" way of applying styles is resolved.</li>

   Alloy-89 created as a separate task.</li>
