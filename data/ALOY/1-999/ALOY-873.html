<h3>Description</h3>

iOS 7 fails on the following demo:

<a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/alloy/tree/master/test/apps/models/binding_listview" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/alloy/tree/master/test/apps/models/binding_listview</a>

The first time the rows are rendered right. When the app is restarted, the items are not rendered right. This also happens with sections. I have attached two images, showing before close and after opening for a second time.

Inserting or resetting the model does not seem to help.

This happens on both devices and simulator. It does not matter whether it is compiled with iOS sdk 6.1 or 7.

Android has no problem handling the same case.

   This app will not work correctly until TIMOB-13678 is resolved as I am experiencing the exact same error when the app attempts to repopulate the app. I may just need to indicate that this TIMOB issue exists in the app for the time being.</li>

   It's not really that important, but how did the reporter end up to be someone else than me? I had a hard time finding this issue because it didn't show up as me being the reporter :)</li>

   I just added you as the reporter. Sometimes when our support staff moves a ticket from TC to ALOY, it seems the original reporter gets lost. I'll see if we can find the root of that.</li>

   [~tlukasavage] I tried reproducing this issue with current master, 3.2.2.GA, 3.2.1.GA  could not reproduce it. I may be missing something here. When you get time could you please retest this test and let us know.

   I cannot reproduce this issue with 3.2.2.GA, Alloy 1.3.1 on the iOS 7.1 simulator. Steps: launch app, Cmd+Shift+H, double-Cmd+Shift+H, swipe up to kill app, Cmd+Shift+H, launch app -> same rendering. I can repeat this multiple times and I get the same item rendering each time. In another test, I launched the app, reset the data, added three "template 3" items, then fully-closed the app & relaunched. I get the proper item rendering each time. </li>

   Resolving this as Cannot Reproduce based on my testing with 3.2.2.GA & Alloy 1.3.1.</li>

   OSX: 10.9.2
