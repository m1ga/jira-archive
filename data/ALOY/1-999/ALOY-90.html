<h3>Description</h3>

In order to leverage some of Titanium Studio's features, and OS features, we are going to rename the views extensions to <code>txml</code> and the style extensions to <code>tss</code>. These first need to be abstracted out into constants and then changed in the appropriate places in code. While the models and configs will continue to use the <code>json</code> extension, they will also be abstracted out to constants in case they change in the future.

   We should only apply custom extension that have Alloy specific processing so our style files will require a special extension but we should leave our view files as xml. After speaking with the Ti Studio team they can still apply custom icons, wizards and content assist to files based on Ti Studio knowing it's an Alloy project. 
   
   Later based on developer feedback we can decide if the alternative approach of xml, models, configs have custom icons make sense.</li>

   yep, we only need a new extension where we have changed the functionality of the underlying format, as is the case with our styles, where we use a JSON derivative.</li>

   "tss" is now the file extension used for styles instead of "json". Most other file types (views, controllers, etc...) have all had their file extensions abstracted out as well in case we need to change them in the future.
   
   All sample apps have been modified and test to reflect the new changes.</li>

   reopened so that we can wait for the linked TiStudio ticket to be addressed</li>
