<h3>Description</h3>

Since Alloy 1.3.0-cr Widgets (and Requires) in TableViews don't get the <code>__parentSymbol</code> property anymore. This causes widgets like [infiniteScroll](<a href="https://github.com/fokkezb/nl.fokkezb.infiniteScroll/)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/fokkezb/nl.fokkezb.infiniteScroll/)</a> to crash the app.

For effective widgets it is essential for them to know about their context.

<h4>To reproduce</h4>

1. Run the attached project
2. See how it crashes
3. Open the <code>Resources/iphone/alloy/controllers/index.js</code> file to see that indeed the <code>__parentSymbol</code> property is missing.
4. Try again with an earlier version of Alloy and see it working.

   Same for my [pullToRefresh](<a href="https://github.com/fokkezb/nl.fokkezb.pullToRefresh/)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/fokkezb/nl.fokkezb.pullToRefresh/)</a> widget. For both I've released a version that has a manual workaround.</li>

   Fokke, can you plead let us know which version of Alloy first shows the problem? What is the manual workaround? [~tlukasavage], FYI</li>

   __parentSymbol was never meant to be a public API, hence the [double underscores](<a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#</a>!/guide/Alloy_Best_Practices_and_Recommendations-section-36735073_AlloyBestPracticesandRecommendations-NamingConventions) and no mention in the documentation. I can take a look, but I'm not sure that this will be able to be resolved for 1.3.0.</li>

   As stated in the comments, <code>__parentSymbol</code> is not intended to be used directly by developers, and probably doesn't do exactly what you think it does. The instances where it is undefined are by design. <code>__parentSymbol</code> is passed through controllers only when the parent/child UI parsers actually need them. The manner in which Ti.UI.TableView is parsed causes it not to pass <code>__parentSymbol</code> as TableView and its children do not have the normal add()/remove() relationship that <code>__parentSymbol</code> is meant to preserve. 
   
   I'm closing this as "won't fix". You can, however, open a feature request for a true public API that does what you _think_ <code>__parentSymbol</code> does, which I'm assuming you think it is _always_ a reference to the current XML UI component's direct parent, which is not currently the case. </li>

   [~ingo] the workaround is to instruct people to manually call an <code>init</code> method in the controller, passing the object to act upon as its parameter. I think this is against the idea of self-configuring widgets so I will create a ticket to request <code>__parentSymbol</code> to be formalized/reformatted as a property for developers to use.</li>
