   1) Update install section to talk about platform issues like the pre-release is only for mac-osx and there are path issues with non default installs of node and npm. Inline provide possible fixes
   
   2) Add a debug section describing that breakpoint can be added to components but a debugger is in the works.
   
   3) In the goals section add as much real detail as possible as to benefits like reduces code by x percent

   I noticed in the README that the link in this line "See the *Widget Example* for an example of building and using a widget." links to a 404 page.</li>
