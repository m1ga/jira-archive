<h3>Description</h3>

For LiveView, TiShadow and RapidDev it would be of great use if we could do <code>alloy compile --platform ios,android</code> or <code>alloy compile --platform all</code> to have Alloy compile for multiple or all platforms listed in <code>tiapp.xml</code> under <code>&lt;deployment-targets /&gt;</code>. Then we could push to all connected devices, regardless of their platforms.

Most of the files are already in platform specific folders now. The only ones that are not are the builtins and <code>app.js</code>. The builtins can easily me moved to the platform folders as well and I just tested that this would work for <code>app.js</code> also, but that might not be the case for all SDKs?

   BTW, I see that <code>animation.js</code> is both in <code>Resources/alloy/animation.js</code> and <code>Resource/alloy/[platform]/alloy/animation.js</code> and <code>app.js</code> is also both in the root as well as in the platform folders? Why is that?</li>
