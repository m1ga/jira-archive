<h3>Description</h3>

Right now the only way, via Alloy, to enable data binding with your view is using special XML notation. It would be good for developers to have the option to dynamically create bound objects in their controllers as well. This will allow dynamic assignment of collections/models to binding behaviors. This can be done now with pure Backbone code, but a clean, simple binding API for Alloy would allow developers to not only bind with Backbone objects, but any model backend they choose, be it 3rd party or custom built.
