		"description": "I'm really new in Titanium and don't really know what is the good way to purpose an improvement.\r\nI find TSS very powerfull and find the JSON notation very good.\r\nI disappointed me is the fact that alloy parse and compile the tss file, even if it seems to be json. Then the parser is limited to simple json expression, even if it is transform into real js like a copy/paste (or it seems to do this ;-))\r\nA simple example of what I would like is :\r\napp/styles/index.tss\r\n\"TextField\": {\r\n  borderWidth: 2+1\r\n}\r\n\"Button\": customProjectFunction(),\r\n\r\nWhich would be \"transformed\" into \r\nResources/iphone/alloy/controllers/Login.js\r\n$.__views.txtMyTextField = Ti.UI.createTextField({\r\n  borderWidth: 2+1\r\n});\r\n$.__views.txtMyButton = Ti.UI.createButton(customProjectFunction());\r\n\r\nI'm sure there are some reasons to do as it is now, but this feature would provide a very flexible way to make styles.",

It is a massive change/feature that will require a substantial amount of planning to avoid it becoming a succession of band-aid fixes.",
