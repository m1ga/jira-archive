<h3>Description</h3>

IDs within the Test environment need to be unique and unchanging so that recorded tests can be reused after the developer inserts new UI components into the views. This is generally the case when the developer adds <code>id</code> properties to all UI components. But it may not be so when Alloy generates IDs for elements not directly assigned an <code>id</code>.

The request is to add a <code>touchTestId</code> property to all components at compile time that is both unique and unchanging over subsequent builds.

Proposed is to:

 * set touchTestId = id string entered by developer, to be re-assigned with each build to account for developers changing and reassigning id strings
 * if the id string is not set, generate a unique value in the form ttID1234, which would never be reused in subsequent builds
