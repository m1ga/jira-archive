   Installing TiSDK 3.2.1 beta now, but I do not see this issue with the following setup:
   
   * Alloy 1.3.1-beta4
   * titanium CLI 3.2.1-beta3
   * TiSDK 3.2.0
   
   So even if I do reproduce with the TiSDK 3.2.1 beta, this is in all likelihood a TIMOB issue.</li>
<li>Alan Leard 2014-01-29

   I can consistently reproduce & resolve without changing any environment variables except Alloy GA >> Alloy@1.3.1-beta3 >> Alloy GA </li>
<li>Tony Lukasavage 2014-01-29

   I cannot reproduce with the following confiugration:
   
   * alloy 1.3.1-beta4
   * titanium cli 3.2.1-beta3
   * tisdk 3.2.1.v20140128171647
   * ios sim 7.0.3
   
   I followed these steps:
   
   <code><pre>
   ti create --id com.testing.aloy943 --name aloy943 --workspaceDir . --platforms=android,ios,iphone,ipad,mobileweb --no-prompt
   cd aloy943
   alloy new .
   <h4>change tiapp.xml sdk-version to 3.2.1.v20140128171647</h4>
   ti build -p ios
   </pre></code>
   
   Please try your test again with this configuration. If you are still encountering the issue I will re-open the ticket.</li>

   Ok, tried with Alloy 1.3.1-beta4 and have the same issue.  Steps I took:
   1. Build with Alloy GA, CLI 3.2.1-beta3, TiSDK 3.2.1v20140121132444
   2. Confirm App icon works as expected.
   3. Upgrade to Alloy 1.3.1-beta4, clean and rebuild with Alloy 1.3.1-beta4, CLI 3.2.1-beta3, TiSDK 3.2.1v20140121132444
   4. App icon is not included.
   5. Clean and Build again with TiSDK 3.2.0.GA
   6. App icon AND SPLASH screen are not included
   7. Revert to Alloy GA (npm remove/npm install -g alloy)
   8. Clean and Build with TiSDK 3.2.0.GA & TiSDK 3.2.1v20140121132444 changing no other environment variables.
   9. App icon and splash screen work as expected with both builds
   
   Note: Clean = Deleting build directory & Resources directory as well as deleting app from simulator
   
   Please let me know if you need me to do anything else specific.</li>

   I am unable to reproduce this issue. I get the custom splash screen and icon. I followed these steps:
   
   alloy 1.3.1-beta4
   titanium CLI 3.2.1-beta3
   SDK 3.2.1.v20140121132444
   iOS sim 7.0.3
   
   1. <code>ti setup</code> then select the preview SDK version
   2. <code>ti create --id com.testing.aloy943 --name aloy943 --workspaceDir . --platforms=android,ios,iphone,ipad,mobileweb --no-prompt</code>
   3. <code>cd aloy943</code>
   4. <code>alloy new .</code>
   5. I grabbed a couple of images from Google Images and ran them through <a href="http://ticons.fokkezb.nl/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://ticons.fokkezb.nl/</a> to generate a set of icons/splash screens. I copied & pasted those over the stock graphics provided in app/assets
   6. <code>ti build -p ios</code> 
   
   Custom splash screen was shown as app launched. Custom icon is on home screen. See <a href="http://note.io/1kcyfxg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://note.io/1kcyfxg</a>

<li>Alan Leard 2014-01-30

   Only difference I can see is that I am building directly from Appcelerator Studio not CLI...</li>
<li>Tony Lukasavage 2014-01-30

   [~aleard] can you try via CLI like me and Tim and see if you still encounter the issue? If you do not, then it's obviously a Studio issue and we can move it to their project and hopefully they can shed some light on the disparity.</li>
<li>Alan Leard 2014-01-30

   Ok, I figured out the root.  This is a theme issue.  If you have an app (attached) with the splash screen and the icon in a theme folder, then the issue appears consistently and reverting to Alloy 1.3.0 resolves it.  Please test with attached app.</li>
<li>Alan Leard 2014-01-30

   Sample app with theme for testing.</li>
<li>Tony Lukasavage 2014-01-30

    Re-opening due to valid test case being added.</li>
<li>Tim Poulsen 2014-01-30

    Tested with attached app:
    
    It wouldn't build in Studio for me until I added icons to the app/assets folder. So for the first few tests here, I built from the command line
    
    <h4>No graphics in app/assets, test via ti build -p ios</h4>
    
    Alloy 1.4.0 (pre-release) - no app icon, no splash screen
    Alloy 1.3.1-beta4 - no app icons, no splash screen
    Alloy 1.3.0 GA - splash screen from the theme's assets folder, but no app icon
    
    <h4>I added a starter set of icons to app/assets/iphone, then tested with ti build -p ios</h4>
    
    Alloy 1.4.0 (pre-release) - splash screen from theme's assets folder, but no app icon
    Alloy 1.3.1-beta4 - splash screen from theme's assets folder, but no app icon
    Alloy 1.3.0 GA - splash screen from theme's assets folder, but no app icon
    
    Finally, with graphics in the app/assets folder, I was able to build with Studio. No difference from using ti build.

    Cannot reproduce following steps:

    2. Build on iOS Simulator (see environments details below).

    Functional testing should follow the testing listed in the description. [~aleard] can you please test with the 1_3_X branch? Please make sure to remove the <code>Resources</code> directory first, just to be sure we see how it works in a clean state.
