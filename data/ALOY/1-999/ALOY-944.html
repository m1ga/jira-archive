<h3>Description</h3>

When a controller uses the <code>baseController</code> property, it will basically result in the compiled controller extending the specified controller instead of the standard [BaseController.js](<a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/alloy/blob/master/Alloy/lib/alloy/controllers/BaseController.js)." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/alloy/blob/master/Alloy/lib/alloy/controllers/BaseController.js).</a> The extending controller will inherit the extended controller's UI and non-private controller code.

This is nice for cases like the [inheritance example](<a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/alloy/blob/master/test/apps/advanced/inheritance/_generated/ios/alloy/controllers/animatedDialog.js)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/alloy/blob/master/test/apps/advanced/inheritance/_generated/ios/alloy/controllers/animatedDialog.js)</a> in the Alloy repo where only the controller-part is extended, but there is no way to do the same with the UI. This is because the top-level views of a controller are stored in a private <code>roots</code> variable of the extended controller. You can push new top-level views using <code>addTopLevelView</code>, but not remove any.

I would like to have the possibility of re-setting the top-level views for the extending controller, so that I can decide what parts of the exteded controller's UI I want to re-use by adding them to the extending controller UI and then add then set that UI as the top-level.

I guess it might be as simple as adding a <code>setTopLevelViews</code> method to the <code>BaseController</code> that would accept an array of views that it replace <code>roots</code> with?

Looking forward to your thoughts.
