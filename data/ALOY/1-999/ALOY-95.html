<h3>Description</h3>

There is currently an ACS adapter in the community written by Aaron Saunders. I will work with Aaron to see if we can get it incorporated into the core of Alloy.

   The ACS adapter has been managed externally for a while now with success. If an adapter needs to be created and managed by Appcelerator, this will likely become the responsibility of the ACS team.</li>
