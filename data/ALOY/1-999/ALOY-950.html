<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Improvement description</h4>
We should deprecate the usage of the localStorage adapter for Alloy Models. 
It could create confusion as only supports MobileWeb and Tizen and is outdated by the 'properties' adapter (that supports all platforms). 

See also <a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#</a>!/guide/Alloy_Sync_Adapters_and_Migrations-section-36739597_AlloySyncAdaptersandMigrations-Ready-MadeSyncAdapters

Will need updates to documentation that includes sample code to use Properties rather than localStorage. Tizen support has already been removed, so this will focus on only MobileWeb. Make sure the change is communicated in the release notes.
