   [~aleard] I think I know what you're asking for here. But some clarification would help me and QE. Could you post a sample app showing how you'd like this to work, plus any considerations or details describing how a developer would implement this feature?</li>
<li>Alan Leard 2014-06-09

   I have attached a sample app.  Notice that the included widget has its own i18n directory and its own set of language strings.  The widget developer should be able to independently manage the language included in any of their UI elements without having to ask the application owner to modify their strings.xml files at an application level.</li>

   PR: <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/alloy/pull/446" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/alloy/pull/446</a>
   Test app: <a href="https://github.com/feons/alloy/tree/ALOY-967/test/apps/testing/ALOY-967" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/feons/alloy/tree/ALOY-967/test/apps/testing/ALOY-967</a>
   
   Functional Test:
   
       1. Run the test app on ios 
       2. The localized strings from each widgets are displayed as illustrated by the attached screenshot.</li>

   Updated functional test steps:
   
   You can use Feon's test app (included in the PR). However, you can't run it using the jake test harness. Instead:
   
   1. Create a new Alloy project. 
   2. Copy the contents of the 967 test app's folder, minus the i18n folder, to your new project's app folder.
   3. Copy the test app's i18n folder to your project's root folder
   4. Now run the app. Change the language of your simulator/device from English to Spanish. The app name on the springboard should change. Open the app. You get new language strings from both the app and widget labels.
   5. Change your sim/device back to English. App name and labels change back to English strings.

   Reopening for consideration of alternate ways to implement the functionality.</li>
<li>Ingo Muschenetz 2014-08-28

   Please work on the blocking ticket, and then take this one.</li>
<li>Tim Poulsen 2014-09-02

   We will need input & guidance from [~cbarber] on the blocking ticket before we can work on it.</li>
<li>Tim Poulsen 2015-02-13

   This is resolved by ALOY-858
   
   However, TIMOB-18570 will prevent you from testing/confirming this with the iOS simulator. Use an iOS device or Android emulator to test until that ticket is resolved.</li>
