<h3>Description</h3>

The Alloy repo contains many sample projects. However, developers seem to be unaware that they exist. We need to make them more prominent. This will include updates to documentation, moving some samples to be importable through Studio, and perhaps other changes. 

Please investigate and document (in this ticket) the options we have to publicize and publish these apps. Ideas might include better documentation, including more samples within Studio (Dashboard or Samples view), create a KitchenSink-like master app that includes all the samples, etc.

In the Alloy repo, under _alloy/test/apps_, we have a collection of individual apps demonstrating a specific concept. It is very similar to the classic Kitchen Sink demo app, but are not consolidated into on single app yet.
