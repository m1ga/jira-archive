<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Problem Description</h4>
With the Alloy compiler trying to become smarter in compiling only those files that are changed, it happens more often that for different reasons the <code>Resources</code> directory is not up-to-date anymore. For this reason I'd like to see the <code>Resources</code> folder emptied or removed with <code>ti clean</code> and the Studio options using this CLI command. This way I can instruct people to do a clean as a first attempt to resolve compile/build problems.

   This is not a TIMOB issue. This is an Alloy issue. Alloy SHOULD NOT be a standalone command line tool. It SHOULD be a Titanium CLI plugin that includes includes a hook into the "clean" command. It should also tie into the "create" command "config" hook to add a --alloy flag, and tie into the "pre-build" hook to compile the app dir into the Resource dir.
   
   If the "project" command was finished, we should have a hook in there that allows you to change a Titanium classic app into an Alloy app. In the meantime, we could have an "alloy" command with a "new" subcommand (i.e. ti alloy new).</li>

   Sounds like a plan.</li>

   Adds a CLI hook to empty the resources directory for an Alloy project
   
   Functional review:
   
   1. Create a new Alloy project, or in an existing Alloy project, enter <code>alloy install plugin .</code>  to install the new hook
   2. Build the project and confirm you have contents in the Resources directory
   3. Do <code>ti clean</code> and confirm that Resources is empty (but the dir still exists)
   4. Build again
   5. Do <code>ti clean --shallow</code> and confirm that build was emptied but Resources was not</li>
