   Can confirm from experience that Mads' REST adapter is working with Backbone 1.x. What would be nice however is to add a REST adapter to Alloy, based upon Backbone's own sync method.</li>

   Looked at backbone version 0.9.9, 0.9.10, 1.0.0, 1.1.0, 1.1.1 and 1.1.2.
   Model apps in the test directory are affected by following changes that break backwards compatibility:
   
   *v0.9.10*
   {quote}
   Passing \{silent:true\} on change will no longer delay individual "change:attr" events, instead they are silenced entirely. 
   {quote}
   
   So <code>silent:true</code> suppresses the <code>change:attr</code> events entirely, view is not updated to reflect the new changes .
   
   This could be fixed by remove silent option in adapter.
   
   *v1.0.0*
   {quote}
   Renamed Collection's "update" to set, for parallelism with the similar model.set(), and contrast with reset. It's now the default updating mechanism after a fetch. If you'd like to continue using "reset", pass \{reset: true\}. 
   {quote}
   
   This means that Backbone collections do not emit 'reset' event after fetch, so to use old functionality, pass <code>{reset: true}</code>when calling <code>collection#fetch()</code> will work with existing sql adapter.
   
   OR override the fetch method in the model JS file:
   
   <code><pre> 
       extendCollection : function(Collection) {
           _.extend(Collection.prototype, {
   			fetch: function(options) {
   				options = options ? _.clone(options) : {};
   				options.reset = true;
   				return Backbone.Collection.prototype.fetch.call(this, options);
   			}
           });
   
           return Collection;
       }
   </pre></code></li>

   This change will mean existing apps could break unless they are updated. Therefore, I recommend that we
   
   * Continue with Backbone 0.9.x as the default in Alloy 1.6
   * Provide optional support for 1.1.2 in Alloy 1.6 -- include it, enable setting the version in config.json, and document the new requirements for models if a developer chooses to enable it
   * Deprecate 0.9.x in Alloy 1.6 -- update the docs, include in release notes
   * Change to 1.1.2 as the default in 1.7 but continue to ship 0.9.x for backward compatibility</li>

   ALOY-1074 implements the change.</li>
<li>Tim Poulsen 2014-10-23

   Reopen to backport to 1_6_X branch</li>
<li>Eric Wieber 2015-03-25

   Verified fixed using:
   
   Titanium SDK 4.0.0.v20150323131014
   Studio 4.0.0.201503231407
   Appc NPM: 0.3.34
   Appc CLI 0.2.187
   Alloy 1.6.0-alpha
   
   Adaptors working as expected using backbone 1.1.2.</li>
</ol>
