<h3>Description</h3>

I've prepared a PR with some updates for the Alloy templates:

<a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/alloy/pull/480" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/alloy/pull/480</a>

Changes:

- Re-Organises platform files copied in by new-command to support the next two:
- Moves MarketPlaceArtwork.png to the project root folder to save APK size
- Adds iTunesConnect.png to the project root folder
- Adds iOS7 icons
- Adds iTunesArtwork@2x file (note: upscaled!)
- Optimised all assets, saving more then 1MB or 20%

Ideally the <code>iTunesArtwork@2x</code> file would be replaced since this one is scaled up.

   What still needs to be done is:
   
   * Create a new iTunesArtwork@2x using the original PSD to replace the upscaled I included
   * Fix the iPad splash screens to be the sizes Apple specifies instead of what is in the Titanium docs (compare *height* and *heightFix* in <a href="https://github.com/FokkeZB/TiCons-CLI/blob/master/lib/specs.js#L160" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/FokkeZB/TiCons-CLI/blob/master/lib/specs.js#L160</a> and beyond)
   * Fix the docs to give the right sizes</li>

   As well as:
   
   * Have *ti build* remove the iTunesArtwork(@2x) files when the target is *dist-appstore* as is advised by Apple: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/iOs/qa/qa1686/_index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://developer.apple.com/library/iOs/qa/qa1686/_index.html</a></li>

   Waiting on new splash screen assets from Tyrus ...</li>

   New PR <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/alloy/pull/505" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/alloy/pull/505</a> includes updated artwork, as well as the changes submitted in [~fokke]'s PR.
   
   Functional test:
   
   1. Create a new project from the CLI, targeted at all platforms.
   2. Build the app for each platform in turn (iOS, Android, MobileWeb, and BlackBerry) and observe the launch screen as the app opens. It should be correctly-sized, with the proper aspect ratio, showing the new artwork.
   3. Close the app and observe it's icon. It should reflect the new artwork.</li>

   Android "drawable-xxxhdpi/appicon.png" included in the Alloy Repository, is not updated - see screenshot.

   Per Ingo, I've backed out the changes in graphics files, though the other changes of this ticket are still implemented.
   
   PR <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/alloy/pull/522" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/alloy/pull/522</a>
   
   Functional test: create a new Alloy project then examine the graphics:
   
   * In project root: iTunesConnect.png and MarketplaceArtwork.png - old images, but new location
   * app/assets/<platform> the various graphics per platform
   * platform/android/res/drawable-XXXX the icons at various resolutions
   
   There should be none of the new-style graphics in those locations. There is no iTunesArtwork@2x and some icon sizes supplied previously are not there. The icons match what you'd get with <code>alloy new</code> with Alloy 1.4.</li>

    Verified fix on:
    
    Mac OSX 10.9.4
    Appcelerator Studio, build: 3.4.0.201408270900
    Titanium SDK build:  3.4.0.v20140826143313
    Titanium CLI, build: 3.4.0-dev
    Alloy: 1.5.0-dev
    
    Opened the project directory in finder and checked each folder that contained any assets to verify they are the correct versions. There are no incorrect assets in the project.
    
    Closing ticket.</li>
