<h3>Description</h3>

The latest version of the moment.js library is v2.7.0, yet Alloy includes an outdated version 2.1.0 as a built in.  

There are new features and bug fixes on the new version that we could use. As of now, we have to include moment 2.7.0 as a stand-alone lib on our Alloy project for these new features and cannot use the built-in.

   Perhaps moment changed how it handles languages, because the apps/advanced/momentjs example app is not working as expected with your change. The language of the date output string is not updating as it should. Would you make sure that the app is using the correct techniques, and if necessary update the language files.</li>

   Unfortunate that we have to modify moment.js to include it within Alloy. However, that's what was done in previous versions. The test apps all work now. Thanks!
