<h3>Description</h3>

Alloy is currently using Backbone in version 0.9.2. This version is more than two years old! I think that finally is time to move on and update it. This update will certainly bring many new features/improvements and also will please many developers that waits for it.

   I agree that we need to update Backbone. I'm closing this ticket only because there's another one already in the system regarding that. Please add yourself as a watcher on that ticket so you get updates as we implement it.</li>
