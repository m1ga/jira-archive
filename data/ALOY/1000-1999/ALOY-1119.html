<h3>Description</h3>

The opportunity to specify the View of separator instead of doing it in the ItemTemplate. Do it in the templates is not convenient because for different elements can be specified different template.

   Thanks for your report [~falko]! [~tlukasavage]: can you please set [~falko] as the original reporter? TIA!</li>

   I'm not sure I understand the request being made here. Please improve the description, with a use-case, and sample code or pseudo code of how you feel this should work. 
   
   ListViews, being data-oriented components, must generally be defined via the templates. Data is formatted by that template to create the actual cells rendered to the screen. If you're suggesting ListViews operate differently, that would be an SDK feature request not an Alloy ticket.</li>

   Per the docs, there is no property separatorView of ListView. Alloy can't expose what doesn't exist.</li>

   Alloy?! I did not offer it to implement in Alloy.</li>

   [~falko] I guess I don't understand what you're asking for with this ticket then.  Is this a new feature request for the SDK? To add a separatorView property? Let me know so that I can reopen the ticket and assign it to the right project.</li>

   Closing as invalid. If this is incorrect, please reopen.</li>
