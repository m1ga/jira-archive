<h3>Description</h3>

There is a discrepancy in the naming of the folder for iOS-specific resources in the Alloy file structure.

For assets and libs, the folder is called "iphone".

For controllers, views, and styles, the folder is called "ios".

I think we should have one consistent folder name for Alloy.

   Added sample project.
   
   Running the project as-is, the iOS-specific view, asset and lib files are not used.
   
   To use the iOS-specific resources, copy the image from the app/assets/ios folder to the app/assets/iphone folder, rename app/views/iphone to app/views/ios and rename app/lib/ios to app/lib/iphone.</li>

   [~fmiao] Can you take a look at this? If not, I will tomorrow.</li>

   Possibly caused by changes from ALOY-963</li>

   Not caused by ALOY-963. This same behavior is observed in Alloy 1.3.1 and 1.4.x, per tests by me and Feon. </li>

   Functional test
   
   Use the included ALOY\-1122 test app. Run for iOS. Click the label, the resulting alert should output the message the sum of 1+2 is  3. The graphic at the bottom of the screen should be an Appcelerator logo. Repeat for Android.
   
   Note that for iOS, the lib being included is lib/ios/util.js not lib/iphone/util (as that version would return "the sum of 1+2 is error") and that the asset includes is assets/iphone/appcelerator.png (correct logo) not assets/ios/appcelerator.png (which is a bug graphic)</li>

   Original PRs didn't work for Android or MobileWeb as expected.
   
   New PR for master: <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/alloy/pull/541" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/alloy/pull/541</a>
   Updated PR for 1_5_X: <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/alloy/pull/535" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/alloy/pull/535</a> 
   
   Same functional test except that the alert on Android says 1+2 = android so that you're sure you're getting the lib/android/util.js file and not the one from the main directory or ios subdirectory.
