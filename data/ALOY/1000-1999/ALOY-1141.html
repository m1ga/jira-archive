   Studio will detect the missing <sdk-version> tag and add it for you, setting it to the highest SDK version you have installed. When you open tiapp.xml, you should see a small orange icon (exclamation point in a triangle) next to the SDK version drop-down list indicating that an "invalid" SDK version was detected.
   
   As discussed over Flowdock, the SDK version was removed from the HarnessTemplate's tiapp.xml to:
   
   * make it easier to test Alloy development with multiple SDK versions
   * while preventing unwanted changes to the HarnessTemplate from being included in pull requests
   
   The change was made as part of the 1.5 release and designed to work well with the <code>jake app:run</code> command. </li>

   I think a valid solution for now could be to add a comment in the Jake documentation in the Alloy repo (i.e. specifying the user should open/save tiapp.xml in case using Harness project imported into Studio).
   
   I also confirm the correct iPhone simulator is launched when using CLI.
   1. Run <code>jake app:setup dir=basics/simple</code>
   2. From the Harness project folder, run: <code>ti build -p ios -C &lt;Device_ID&gt;</code>
   where the device ID is obtained running: <code>ti info -t ios</code></li>

   See my comments on ALOY-1137 for workarounds.
   
   We may be moving away from jake. Rather than updating the docs on what is a developer-only, and likely rarely used tool in the Alloy repo, I'd rather recommend general users to use the <code>--testapp</code> argument as described in ALOY-1137.</li>
