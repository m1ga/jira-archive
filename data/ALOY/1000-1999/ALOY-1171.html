<h3>Description</h3>

Studio is blissfully unaware of what tags are valid underneath other tags. We just offer the full set to the user. It'd be great if we had something like a DTD so we knew which tags are valid underneath others.

There are other cases where it'd be great to get the input from Alloy rather than Studio hard-code:  i.e. "artificial" tags (tags that aren't real types, but may behave like other tags/types - LeftNavButton is not a type, but acts like a Button)

   [~cwilliams] Do you want an actual DTD (XML schema) and if so, what format? Or would a JSON format, like a simplified version of <a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/data/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/data/index.html</a> meet your needs? What specific data would you need enumerated?</li>

   A Relax NG schema would be ideal. It's easy to read and easy to convert into a DTD or XML Schema.
   
   I agree with Chris Williams that validating the Alloy XML files is something you want to do to catch your errors before building. And currently in Studio when you choose Commands > XML > Validate Syntax, there's nothing to validate the XML *against*,
