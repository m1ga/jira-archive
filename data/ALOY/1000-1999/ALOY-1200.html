<h3>Description</h3>

I've found myself creating lots of new Alloy projects from the command line, which first requires creating a Ti project, of course. To save some time, I created a shell script that takes a app name, runs <code>ti create</code> with some sensible defaults, and then runs <code>alloy new</code> on the new Titanium project folder.

This has been especially useful in conjunction with ALOY-1115 to quickly create a project from one of the test apps.

It would be useful, I think, if the Alloy CLI's <code>create</code> command included an option to create a new Titanium project, if one doesn't exist. This could either be an opt-in CLI switch, or maybe via a prompt ("No Titanium project found, would you like to create one?") instead of just throwing an error ("Resources not found"), which is not that helpful.
