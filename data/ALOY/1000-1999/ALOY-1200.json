		"description": "I've found myself creating lots of new Alloy projects from the command line, which first requires creating a Ti project, of course. To save some time, I created a shell script that takes a app name, runs {{ti create}} with some sensible defaults, and then runs {{alloy new}} on the new Titanium project folder.\r\n\r\nThis has been especially useful in conjunction with ALOY-1115 to quickly create a project from one of the test apps.\r\n\r\nIt would be useful, I think, if the Alloy CLI's {{create}} command included an option to create a new Titanium project, if one doesn't exist. This could either be an opt-in CLI switch, or maybe via a prompt (\"No Titanium project found, would you like to create one?\") instead of just throwing an error (\"Resources not found\"), which is not that helpful.",
