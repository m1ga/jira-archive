   The app was actually working on iPad. If you rotated it to landscape, the split would appear and the feed list would be visible. I added a NavigationWindow to the Details window, and a button to its navbar per the SplitWindow docs to provide a way to access the feeds list in portrait orientation.
   
   Functional test:
   
   1. Build for iPad
   2. In portrait, there should be a "Feeds" button in the title bar. Click to show the master view (feeds list) in a popover. In landscape, the split is visible and feeds are shown in the master window on the left; there is no Feeds button.
   3. Build for a phone form factor or other platform. The app should work as before.</li>
