<h3>Description</h3>

When I create a new Alloy Widget the template widget.json config file is out of date, and should default to the current version of Ti SDK and Alloy I am using.

The current default widget.json looks like this:

{
	"id": "<ID>",
	"name": "<Name>",
	"description" : "",
	"author": "",
	"version": "1.0",
	"copyright":"Copyright (c) 2012",
	"license":"Public Domain",
	"min-alloy-version": "1.0",
	"min-titanium-version":"2.1",
	"tags":"",
	"platforms":"android,blackberry,ios,mobileweb"
}

Also, the documentation for containing widgets within widgets (last section of <a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#</a>!/guide/Alloy_Widgets) is incorrect, referencing 'config.json' and not explaining where the widget should be located.

   While I'll admit that Alloy 1.0 and TiSDK 2.1 are ancient, those are minimum versions not current versions. Widget authors should update them to the minimum supported versions, which we can't know. We can/should update those to more-recent versions. But, I don't agree that they should be set to the current GA versions.
   
   BTW, the copyright date is calculated (the widget.json template has <code>"copyright":"Copyright (c) &lt;%= new Date().getFullYear() %&gt;",</code> but that makes more sense as you'd want it copyrighted based on its authorship date.
   
   As for the docs, yes, they could use some expanding. But the reference to config.json is valid. It reads: "Follow the same directions from Importing Widgets except the widget's configuration file is called widget.json *instead of config.json*." (emphasis added)</li>
