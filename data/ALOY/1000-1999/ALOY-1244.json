		"description": "When you convert a classic project in an Alloy project, the classic {{Resources/app.js}} file will remain untouched because Alloy works with {{Resources/\\[platform\\]/app.js}}.\r\n\r\nWhile this isn't a problem, it is really confusing for new users, wondering if that code will be executed.\r\n\r\nh1. Solution\r\n\r\nIt would be better if running {{alloy new}} would delete or empty the {{Resources}} folder.\r\n\r\nAs per [~sfeather]'s suggestion this might be improved upon by letting the user confirm he's aware {{Resources}} folder will be deleted and/or renaming it to e.g. {{Resources (classic)}} so it is preserved. This would also improve the current situation where the first time the user runs {{alloy compile}} or {{ti build}} he will lose his classic files as well.\r\n\r\nh1. To reproduce\r\n\r\nExecute the following in a temporary directory:\r\n{code}\r\nti create -t app -p ios -n res --id test.res -d . -u http://appcelerator.com\r\ncd res\r\nalloy new\r\nti build -p ios -b\r\ncd Resources\r\nnano app.js\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nYou'll see that even after alloy compiles {{Resources/app.js}} is still the default classic {{app.js}}.",

The behavior of `ti build` is a different stage of development, namely building, not converting.\r\n3. A user converting a project from classic to alloy doesn't have a place to put their old files in the new structure until `alloy new` has been run.\r\n\r\nIf you are looking for a consumer/user friendly solution, take the contents of the classic Resources, move/rename/place them in Resources.classic or Resources.old to protect/preserve them, create the alloy structure as before and if purging Resources is so important to you, do it.\r\n\r\n",
