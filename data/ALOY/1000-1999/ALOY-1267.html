<h3>Description</h3>

The idea to include a REST sync adapter was first tossed in ALOY-110 and closed as *Won't fix* since there already was a community version by [~viezel]:

However, now we have Arrow and Builder in place, it would be make sense to reconsider and include one in Alloy. It just makes little sense that we promote Alloy-first but the generated Arrow documentation only has classic examples and no instructions to work with models.
