<h3>Description</h3>

Authenticating an app via the Alloy social.js built-in no longer works. Twitter returns a long number, which they direct you to enter into the app. The built-in has no support for this, thus the app cannot be authenticated and you can't send tweets.

   It appears that the social.js built-in is set up to handle Twitter's PIN-based authentication (<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/oauth/pin-based)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://dev.twitter.com/oauth/pin-based)</a> with the code at <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/alloy/blob/master/Alloy/builtins/social.js#L519." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/alloy/blob/master/Alloy/builtins/social.js#L519.</a> However, it's no longer automatically handling that PIN. Until recently, my app worked just fine using social.js. I have not changed my handling or usage of the library, yet now users are being prompted with the PIN. Perhaps Twitter's response payload has changed.
   
   The docs give no guidance on how to manually handle this PIN and there are no sample apps that use it. Maybe this is simply a documentation issue?</li>
