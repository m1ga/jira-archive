<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Issue Description</h4>

The themes on app have most precedence than the app/styles folder.

<h4>Expected behavior</h4>

The user need a hierarchical behavior to override the base theme's styles with app specific ones at the app/styles level without changing the theme itself, you can take a look on web technologies because this is how they work over themes. More specifically, titanium should follow this procedure based on some web technologies:

1.Looks for a file in the current app/style directory that matches the view. If the view is “page-1,” then titanium  should look for a file called page-1.
2.If the styles file or is missing or not exist, titanium should look for a template file called “page-1” in the themes.
3.If the file is missing, titanium will look for a generic style in, app/styles/app.tss file.
4.If the style does not exist, titanium will look for a generic style app.tss file on the theme.


<h4>Steps to Replicate: </h4>
1. Override the app folder attached on a new alloy project
2. View the behavior on the .container color in the app/styles and the theme styles on index.tss

Additional Note: 
This behavior was tested on:
Release 4.1.0
Release 4.0.0
Release 3.5.1

   I'm not sure what do you mean by 'some web technologies', but please refer to <a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#</a>!/guide/Alloy_Styles_and_Themes-section-35621526_AlloyStylesandThemes-StylePriorities for Alloy style priorities.</li>

   Customer know exactly how style priority works in Titanium...which is why we opened this issue. It's completely backwards when it comes to themes. A theme should be overridden at the next level down just like priorities work within the app itself, not the other way around like it currently is. On web technologies CSS works override after another CSS is declared down.
