<h3>Description</h3>

The new <code>/DefaultIcon.png</code> which has platform specific versions at <code>/DefaultIcon-&lt;platform&gt;.png</code> should be theme-able via Alloy.

We probably need a similar approach as with <code>i18n</code> and <code>platform</code> since we can't overwrite the <code>DefaultIcon.png</code> in the project root, so we have to do it at build-time.

   I believe the context for the request was Alloy-themable. Not Android themes as stated in the description.</li>
<li>Jason Kneen 2015-10-14

   Yes Alloy themable since auto-generating icons from DefaultIcon.png is a new feature for iOS (I believe).</li>
<li>Fokke Zandbergen 2015-10-14

   Typo :)</li>
<li>Ricardo Pereira 2015-12-14

   I think that not only DefaultIcon, but GooglePlay, GooglePlayFeature, iTunesConnect, MarketplaceArtwork and MarketplaceArtworkFeature png image files on root folder, also should be theme-able.
   
   ex:
   app/themes/mytheme/GooglePlay.png
   app/themes/othertheme/MarketplaceArtwork.png</li>
<li>Fokke Zandbergen 2015-12-14

   [~ricardo_jcp] those don't end up in the app itself so sure - you can keep them in the theme folder and select from there as you work in iTunesConnect and Goole Play.</li>
<li>Ricardo Pereira 2015-12-14

   Ok, so the only root image used while compiling it's the DefaultIcon?</li>
<li>Fokke Zandbergen 2015-12-14

   Correct, the others you list are for you to upload manually to iTunesConnect and Google Play.</li>
<li>Ricardo Pereira 2015-12-14

   Ok, thanks, just one more doubt, what about android platform resolution icons?
   
   ex: platform/android/res/drawable-hdpi</li>
<li>Fokke Zandbergen 2015-12-14

    Those can already be themed. Just have a platform folder in your theme folder.</li>
<li>Uriel Lizama 2015-12-18

    Is there any roadmap for this?</li>
<li>Feon Sua Xin Miao 2015-12-18

    Hello [~ulizama], we are working on it! :) </li>
<li>Uriel Lizama 2016-02-22

    Hello,
    
    It's been a couple of months without a solution for this issue. Is there a timeframe on when this is going to be addressed? Can you suggest a workaround in the meantime?
    
    I have a project where I have about 12 different themes which are completely different apps, so I need each to have their own icon. This has made using the newer SDKs really hard as I have to do manual work before I compile.
    
    Thanks</li>
<li>Jerod Fritz 2016-02-22

    I have the same situation.  I manually copy the DefaultIcon.png to project root from the the theme folder where I store it temporarily.   Would really like to have the current theme folder included in the search path.  I've deployed the wrong icon a handful of times now just by forgetting that step.</li>
<li>Chris Barber 2016-02-22

    Thanks for the bump guys. We're looking into this. Just need to figure out who will and when implement this.</li>
<li>Jason Kneen 2016-02-22

    Added support in TiTh for this as a workaround

    Support for this is available on Jason's TiCh as well here <a href="https://github.com/jasonkneen/TiCh" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/jasonkneen/TiCh</a></li>
<li>Fokke Zandbergen 2016-03-23

    [~cbarber] I guess we can do this similar as ALOY-1365 now, by moving <code>DefaultIcon.png</code> into the <code>app</code> folder for Alloy?</li>
<li>Chris Barber 2016-03-23

    [~fokkezb] Sure. I don't have the bandwidth to fix it right now. If you have the time, send a fix and I'll test/merge.</li>
<li>Ricardo Pereira 2017-01-08

    Any plans on this ticket?</li>

    For themed project, <code>app/themes/&lt;theme&gt;/DefaultIcon.png</code> will be copied to project root by alloy compile. If theme doesn't exist or no theme is configured, <code>app/DefaultIcon.png</code> will be copied. 
    
    This does require existing apps to move <code>DefaultIcon.png</code> from project root to <code>/app</code> directory.</li>

    Passed validation using Alloy 1.10.5
    Node Version: 6.10.3
    NPM Version: 3.10.10
    Mac OS: 10.13
    Appc CLI: 6.3.0-master.7
    Appc CLI NPM: 4.2.9
    I followed the instruction here:

    Update to not break current usage. 
    1. Exiting apps, default icons exist under project root, no change.
    2. To use the new feature, enable theme under <code>app/config.json</code>, add default icons under <code>app/themes/&lt;theme&gt;</code>.
    
    *Test Steps*
    1. Create an app, default icons exists under project root, alloy compile shouldn't error out, note the default icon use.
    2. Add theme to the app, do no app default icon under theme, alloy compile shouldn't error out, default icon used should be the same as in step 1.
    3. Add default icon to theme, alloy compile shouldn't error out, default icon under selected theme is used.
    4. Add another theme with default icon, select the new theme, alloy compile shouldn't error out, default icon under selected theme is used.
    5. Disable theme, alloy compile shouldn't error out, default icon used should be the same as in step 1.</li>

    FR passed. PR merged, and changes are seen in CLI 6.3.0-master.16.</li>
<li>Creative 2018-02-28

    hi, why isnt this documented anywhere? I have no clue what the compiler does now with a file in <code>app/DefaultIcon.png</code> or <code>/DefaultIcon.png</code> or <code>app/themes/mytheme/DefaultIcon.png</code>.
    
    In additon, why does every change to Alloy or Titanium have to be backwards compatible? It introduces so much scenario specific code that it will likely create bugs.</li>
<li>Creative 2018-02-28

    Odd behaviour:
    
    - Have the file <code>/app/themes/mytheme/DefaultIcon.png</code>
    - Have no <code>/app/DefaultIcon.png</code> or <code>/DefaultIcon.png</code> in your project
    - Use "mytheme" as the app theme in <code>app/config.json</code>
    - Run <code>appc ti build ...</code>
    - On the first compile, a <code>/DefaultIcon.png</code> seems to be copied
    - On the second compile (right after the first), a <code>/app/DefaultIcon.png</code> seems to be copied</li>
</ol>
