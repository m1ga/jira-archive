<h3>Description</h3>

Since TI SDK 5.0.0, we support app icons resizing, placing them into assets catalog etc, so we should do a clean up on the app icons to reduce the number of warnings being shown now.

1. All app icons should NOT have alpha channel.
2. Remove unsupported app icons.

See current trace when there's no DefaultIcon.png or DefaultIcon-ios.png:
<code><pre>
[INFO]  Creating app icon set
[DEBUG] Unsupported app icon Resources/iphone/appicon-176@2x.png, skipping
[DEBUG] Unsupported app icon Resources/iphone/appicon-60.png, skipping
[WARN]  Resources/iphone/appicon-60@2x.png contains an alpha channel and will be flattened against a white background
[WARN]  Resources/iphone/appicon-60@3x.png contains an alpha channel and will be flattened against a white background
[DEBUG] Unsupported app icon Resources/iphone/appicon-72.png, skipping
[DEBUG] Unsupported app icon Resources/iphone/appicon-72@2x.png, skipping
[WARN]  Resources/iphone/appicon-76.png contains an alpha channel and will be flattened against a white background
[WARN]  Resources/iphone/appicon-Small-40.png contains an alpha channel and will be flattened against a white background
[WARN]  Resources/iphone/appicon-Small-40@2x.png contains an alpha channel and will be flattened against a white background
[DEBUG] Unsupported app icon Resources/iphone/appicon-Small-50.png, skipping
[DEBUG] Unsupported app icon Resources/iphone/appicon-Small-50@2x.png, skipping
[WARN]  Resources/iphone/appicon-Small.png contains an alpha channel and will be flattened against a white background
[WARN]  Resources/iphone/appicon-Small@2x.png contains an alpha channel and will be flattened against a white background
[DEBUG] Unsupported app icon Resources/iphone/appicon@2x.png, skipping
</pre></code>

*OR* we can just remove all the ios app icons in the assets folder,  and only have DefaultIcon.png in the root of the project to avoid confusion.

   I would go with removing all the ios app icons in assets folder, and developers just need to create one DefaultIcon.png.</li>

   Functional Test:
   1. Create a new project
   2. Looking into <code>app/assets/iphone</code> folder, there should be no <code>appicon*</code> and <code>iTunesArtwork</code> files</li>

   Noooo!! Apple's HIG recommends that developers use resolution-specific app icons. Your icon for an @3x device should not be the same as your @2x or @1x device. They recommend not simply rescaling a single image. With this change, you're forcing Ti developers to do just what Apple recommends against.
   
   Adding informational messages is fine. Generating missing icons is great. But you need to continue to support custom, per device/per resolution icons for developers who want to use them.</li>

   I looked at the PR and it looks like you're just removing these icons from the Alloy template. Never mind.</li>

   BTW, using SDK 5.1.1.GA I get no iOS app icons. This is for an existing, published app, with all the icon files there. I get warnings  from the Titanium CLI about alpha channels in each of the icons (there aren't any, I've pre-optimized all icon files with ImageOptim.app, and iTunes Connect would have prevented me from publishing the app if there were any alpha channels). It supposedly flattens the images. But I end up with no icons on the simulator (dev build), a device (test build), and an ad-hoc build (production). </li>

   [~skypanther], I unable to reproduce the issues, do you see any icon files under <code>build/iphone/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset</code> ? </li>
<li>Tim Poulsen 2016-01-07

   Sorry Feon, I had to get my ad-hoc build out. I dropped back to 5.0.2.GA, cleaned the project, built it and got icons fine. When I have time, I will investigate and file a ticket if necessary.</li>

   Verified fixed, using:
   
   MacOS 10.11.3 (15D21)
   Studio 4.5.0.201601262138
   Ti SDK 5.2.0.v20160202103508
   Appc NPM 4.2.3-1
   Appc CLI 5.2.0-239
   Alloy 1.7.33
   Xcode 7.2 (7C68)
   
   There are no longer any app icon or iTunes artwork files in newly created Alloy projects.</li>
