<h3>Description</h3>

We should think about how we can refactor data-binding to be more efficient.

*Current situation*

* We add a single event listener to the collections <code>fetch destroy change add remove reset</code> events.
* The event listener always regenerates the views for all models, remove the existing children and adds the newly generated views (for ListViews and some others it just overwrites).

*Problems*

Even if just a single attribute of a single model is changed:

* It uses a lot of memory.
* It crosses the bridge a lot of times.
* It takes a long time as collections become bigger and the bound views more complex.
* Resetting all children causes flickering and scroll position is lost.

*Desired situation*

* For the <code>add</code> event, only child views for the added model(s) are generated and added to the parent.
* For the <code>change</code> event, child views for just the changed model(s) are regenerated and the old ones replaced under the parent.
** Yes, it would be even better if we could just change the child view of the model *attribute* that was changed, but I don't think the complexity of the logic is worth going that far.
* For the <code>destroy</code> and <code>remove</code> events, only child views for the destroyed model(s) are removed from the parent.
