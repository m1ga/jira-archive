In Titanium SDK 5.x and older, {{platform/iphone}} gets copied into the actual compiled application output directory. This is not consistent with other platforms and interferes with differential builds. All files in {{platform/*}} should get copied into {{build/<platform name>}}. So, in Titanium SDK 6, we fix this. Since {{Settings.bundle}} is an edge case, the iOS build will explicitly look for it and copy it to the correct location.",

However, this change would mean Settings.bundle would be copied into the build dir and so it's an edge case where we need it copied into the compiled app output dir.\r\n\r\nThere is no \"merge\" logic. We only overwrite and that logic hasn't changed, only the destination. In Titanium SDK 5.x and older, {{Resouces}}, {{Resources/iphone}}, {{Resources/ios}}, {{platform/iphone}}, and {{platform/ios}} copy files to the same directory {{build/iphone/build/Products/<xcode target>/<appname>.app/}}. This makes no sense and it's not consistent. So, in Titanium SDK 6 I will fix this. Settings.bundle should probably go in the build dir anyways and we'll add it to the Xcode project and let Xcode copy it into the compiled app output dir.\r\n\r\nSo, with regards to the Titanium SDK 6 change and *this* ticket, you have nothing to be worried about. Just know that files in {{platform/iphone}} will be copied to a different place in Titanium SDK 6.\r\n\r\nOk, back on topic.\r\n\r\nAlloy theme files not being copied to the correct destination is an Alloy bug. The {{\\-\\-platform\\-dir}} option is a hack. Alloy must not be lazy and must do things correctly. We'll triage it and eventually fix it.",

					"body": "[~core13] Yes, that's what I'm proposing should be the official behavior. I'm not sure how close we are today to that behavior.\r\n\r\n[~fokkezb] We would only need to merge if an app has two xml files with the same name in separate folders (i.e. {{app/i18n}} and {{app/themes/mine/i18n}}). The Titanium build system will merge all *.xml files into a single i18n file. So Alloy really just needs to check if the destination i18n xml file exists and if so, append a number or something to the filename. For example, your Alloy app has {{app/i18n/en-US/strings.xml}} and {{app/themes/mine/i18n/en-US/strings.xml}}, then during compile Alloy would copy {{app/i18n/en-US/strings.xml}} to {{i18n/en-US/strings.xml}} and copy {{app/themes/mine/i18n/en-US/strings.xml}} to {{i18n/en-US/strings2.xml}}. Much easier and faster than doing a merge.\r\n\r\nI agree with [~fmiao] that Alloy apps should be able to modify the root i18n and platform directories just like the Resources directory.\r\n\r\n",

					"body": "Alloy apps must be able to modify root elements, as it already does with Resources.  Given Alloy is the framework used to create the files used to build an app this should go as far as all elements within the app and not just generating the JS code and moving some assets.\r\n\r\nSo if the App is Alloy based then the Platform and i18n root folders follow the exact same rules as the Resources one already does.  This simple rule 'correction' allows a far greater degree of control for more than Alloy apps with themes and allows future beneficial features to not be stifled based \"we cannot modify root elements\" as Alloy already does.\r\n\r\nSo I vote \"let us stop pretending Alloy does not already modify root elements\" as it simply persists in harming the  evolution of the dev platform going forwards.\r\n\r\nBTW anyone not building an Alloy app when starting a new project is harming themselves, their client, their future productivity not to mention basic human decency rules.
