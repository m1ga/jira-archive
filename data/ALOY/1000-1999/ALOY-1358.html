<h3>Description</h3>

The view must be added to an ImageView.

   [~fmiao] could you get this merged for the Alloy version to ship with CLI 5.2?</li>

   [~hansknoechel] Am I right that the BlurView could be added as child of any (well, most) view? Or is it only ImageView? In that case we might want to validate that.</li>
<li>Hans Knöchel 2016-02-13

   You can add any view to it. But it does not blur the view added to it but blurs the view it's added to. So every view added to it behaves as a normal view children (unblurred).</li>

   That's important info. Could you update the API reference and example to explain/show that? I saw the example formatting was broken btw.</li>
<li>Hans Knöchel 2016-02-13

   Just fixed the docs and updated the API description. Anyway, we should setup an own PR for the alloy functionality, the 5.2.0 time frame would be awesome.</li>

   The PR is already there:

   TIMOB-20176 is marked 5.4.0, not 5.2.0.</li>
<li>Fokke Zandbergen 2016-02-18

   Mmm, you're right :D OK, well then we can do this one for 5.4 as well I guess. Wouldn't hurt to merge it already</li>
