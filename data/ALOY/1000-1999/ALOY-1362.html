<h3>Description</h3>

I try to include [mathjs library](<a href="http://mathjs.org/)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://mathjs.org/)</a> to my project. But have a long delay during compilation in step:

<code><pre>
[INFO]  - android/math.js
[TRACE]   processing "builtins" module...
[TRACE]   processing "optimizer" module...
[TRACE]   processing "compress" module…
</pre></code>

This step takes about 10 minutes …. ! It is sooooo looong!

*Steps to reproduce:*
1. Create Alloy project
2. Download and add lib to the *app/lib* folder
3. Add *require('mathjs')* to the alloy.js
4. Build with command appc *run -p android -l debug -C "Google Nexus 4 - 4.2.2 - API 17 - 768x1280"*

   Hello,
   
   I have tested the issue you reported. I have followed the steps. I created the lib directory and put the math.js file in there, and I required the module in alloy.js. It took me 5 minutes for app to launch in the emulator.  Which is the natural launch time as the emulator need to boot up first. It was even faster the next time, as the emulator was already launched. The issue is not reproducible in our end. Maybe the issue is with your PC memory configuration. Thanks.

   Other people in TiSlack community confirmed this issue. It happens with Alloy but not classic app. 
   Build time on my PC without this lib is about 30 seconds. 
   This delay (10min) present after emulator start. Project compilation paused in the step '*processing "compress" module…*'
   
   30 seconds and 5..10 minutes it is big difference. </li>

   Geekbench 3 test (32-bit mode):  
   Single-Core Score: 3439
   Multi-Core Score: 10717
    	
   But my PC is 64-bit
