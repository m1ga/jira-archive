This will make sure that an existing Alloy app that only has {{/X}} and {{/app/themes/my-theme/X}} or {{/app/widgets/my-widget/X}} will not end up loosing the resources it had in {{/X}}. Of course the change will still be breaking because the resources in themes and widgets will no longer make it to the app. But the migration path is simple because the developer simply has to move the {{/X}} folders to {{/app/X}}. We could even do that for the developer, which would make it not breaking at all, although we still need to notify the developer of the change.",

When you build, the {{platform/<platform-name>}} and {{i18n}} folders in the root of the project get nuked and the files copied from the {{app/platform}} and {{app/i18n}} directories. There's no way logic to preserve the {{platform}} and {{i18n}} directories. Users will need to move those folders into the {{app}} directory. You can override the Alloy app {{platform}} and {{i18n}} files by using a theme. Lastly, a custom widget may have an {{i18n}} directory structure which gets merged with the {{app/i18n}} and {{app/themes/<theme>/i18n}} stings.\r\n\r\nThis PR does not do any sort of differential build or smart file copying. It's not great, but it's also not terrible. At least it's only nuke the {{platform/<platform-name>}} instead of nuking the entire {{platform}} directory.\r\n\r\nThere are no changes at the Titanium SDK level. This is purely solved in Alloy.",

I've tested all combinations I could think off and left a few comments on the PR.\r\n\r\nTwo ideas for simple improvements not related to your changes.\r\n\r\nBut more importantly two ideas to make sure this breaking change (which it still is after all) at least not deletes people's project {{i18n}} and {{platform}} folders without notice. We really can't just be deleting those. There's still people without versioning and backups there :D\r\n\r\nI also think we should bump Alloy to 1.8 to signal the impact of this change. Of course any breaking change should bump major and I'm fine with that as well, but since we've been adding features to patch versions since 1.7 I thought 1.8 would be more appropriate. In anyway, the error in the ideas I suggested needs to have the version we release this with.\r\n\r\n[~cng] we need to make sure CLI 5.2.1 has this Alloy version, of course.\r\n\r\nI'll do a blog post on Alloy theming to give this good exposure as well.",

If i18n matches then delete the matching root folder and copy the theme folder. Then repeat with the platform folder. If one or both does not exist then NO root folders are touched. If only one folder exists inside theme then ONLY that matching one is deleted - not the other. This allows the dev to only change one of the choose to and makes sure if the do not use the facility then no folders are deleted. \r\n* If a matching folder inside theme was not found then check if i18n or platform folders are inside the app folder. If at least one is that was not already processed via the theme point above then repeat the same logic as the first point. \r\n* In essence you ONLY delete a root folder if a matching folder exists in theme and if not in theme in app. I18n and platform folder checking are treated independently of each other. You do not delete root platform just because i18n folder was found you MUST also have found platform. \r\n* New projects should have i18n and platform folders automatically created inside the app folder and documentation updated to match. \r\n* Apps that have i18n or platform folders in the root but not in either theme or app folders should see a warning during processing to show those folders should be moved and be given a URL to the docs to see why\r\n\r\nThis way all existing projects can continue as they do right now as root folders will not be deleted as there are no theme or app folder versions. When devs start to take advantage of the ability to relocate the platform and i18n folders. \r\n\r\nA few if statements resolves all the problems and the warning console entry forwarns the need to update the app structure.

I updated the PR with a bunch of fixes.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, I have now made it so that Alloy will create a file called {{alloy_generated}} in the {{/i18n}} and {{/platform}} directories. If this file exists, then I can nuke it without worry. If the {{alloy_generated}} file is missing, then the build fails with a message saying you must move those folders into your {{app}} directory. It's simple and robust.\r\n\r\nI also:\r\n* Fixed the i18n XML parsing to be more robust\r\n* Added {{/i18n}} and {{/platform}} to the {{.gitignore}} for new projects\r\n* Print a warning if there's a {{.gitignore}} and it's missing {{/i18n}}, {{/platform}}, or {{/Resources}}\r\n* Fixed a small bug with Alloy's hook when parsing the output from the subprocessed Alloy compile command\r\n* Bumped the version number to 1.8.0",

You can now add \"i18n\" and \"platform\" directories in your \"/app\" directory and in your active theme's directory. Additionally, widgets may also have an \"i18n\" directory.\r\n\r\nWhen you build your app, Alloy will delete the \"/i18n\" and \"/platform/<platform>\" directories in the project's root directory. Next it will copy and merge the \"i18n\" and \"platform/<platform>\" directories from the Alloy app's directory into the project's root directory. For platform-specific files, it starts by copying all files from \"/app/platform/<platform>\", then overrides with files from \"/app/theme/<theme name>/platform/<platform>\". i18n files are copied from the \"/app/i18n\" and \"/app/themes/<theme name>/i18n\" directories followed by the each widget's \"/app/widgets/<widget name>/i18n\" directory.\r\n\r\nIt's important to reiterate that the \"/i18n\", \"/platform/<platform>\", and \"/Resources\" directories are regenerated each time you build. Any manual change to files in these directories will be lost during the next build.\r\n\r\nWhen creating a new Alloy project, it will automatically move existing \"/i18n\" and \"/platform\" directories into the \"/app\" directory.\r\n\r\nExisting Alloy apps that already have \"/i18n\" or \"/platform\" directories in the project's root directory will fail to build until these directories into the \"/app\" directory.\r\n{quote}",
