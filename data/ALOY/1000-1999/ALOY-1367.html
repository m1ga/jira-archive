<h3>Description</h3>

We don't have a concise developer guide for Alloy.
It would be great if there is a page that provides step by step guide for anyone who wants to contribute to Alloy.
Some of the basic requirement for a PR to warrant a review: 
1. Sign the CLA
2. Link to JIRA ticket
3. Include test app
4. All tests should pass
5. Code Conventions, this would be solved by integrate a linter.

   Some scripts that really we should wrap in simple NodeJS script:
   
   *How to create a test app*
   
   <code>node tools/create_test.js TICKET</code>
   	
   *How to run a single test app*
   
   <code>jake app:run dir=testing/TICKET</code>
   
   *How to generate known good code for a test app*
   
   <code>node tools/create_generated_code.js testing/TICKET</code>
   
   *How to test a single test app compile*
   
   <code>app=testing/TICKET jake test:spec\[compile.js\]</code>
   	
   *How to test a single test app plus Alloy*
   
   <code>app=testing/TICKET jake test:all</code>
   	
   *How to test all*
   
   <code>jake test:all</code></li>

   [~fmiao] i think this should go to TIDOCS? 
   [~bimmel] fyi.</li>

   [~cng] It sure should, but it needs some more work/thoughts and ideally we'd improve the scripts to simplify. But then, since [~cbarber] is moving Alloy into Titanium this all might be old news soon.</li>

   I wouldn't put any energy into this. Instead I would clean up the TiSDK contributor guide, of which there is a ticket for somewhere.</li>
