<h3>Description</h3>

Regarding the changes made in ALOY-1365: If a user adds resources to their /platform or /i18n folders after building once when they were empty, their contents can be lost.

*Steps to reproduce issue*
1. Create a new project with <code>ti create</code>
2. <code>cd</code> into the project
3. Run <code>alloy new</code>
4. Build the project with <code>ti build</code> (/platform and /i18n folders are created)
5. Add resources to the /platform and /i18n folders
6. Build the project again with <code>ti build</code>

*Expected results*
The /project and /i18n folder contents remain and/or are moved to the app/platform and app/i18n folders. May also get the message to move the root folders inside the app directory.

*Actual Results*
The contents of the folders are deleted and no message is given.

   The <code>/platform</code> and <code>/i18n</code> directories will only be deleted if they contain an <code>alloy_generated</code> file, which clearly states that this folder is going to be deleted next build. This behavior is by design.</li>

   Closing as invalid. If this is incorrect, please reopen.</li>
