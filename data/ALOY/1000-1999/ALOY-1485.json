		"description": "Take the following scenario:\r\n\r\n# I have an Alloy app that targets iOS and Android but only has a {{/platform/android}}, no {{/platform/ios}}.\r\n# I upgraden from Alloy 1.7.35 to 1.8.0, which includes ALOY-1365.\r\n# I continue to work on the iOS version of my app and get a warning to add {{/platform}} to my {{.gitignore}} file. Weird, because \r\nwhy would I stop versioning that if it contains important stuff for Android?\r\n# After a while I switch to work on the Android version and it says:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n[ERROR] Detected legacy \"/platform\" directory in project directory.\r\n[ERROR] Please move the \"/platform\" directory to \"/app/platform\" for Alloy 1.8.0 or later.\r\n[ERROR] Alloy compiler failed\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThis is confusing because didn't I work on my iOS app successfully using Alloy 1.8.0 without having moved the folder?\r\n\r\nAlso, when I'd now move {{/i18n}} to {{/app/i18n}} as it suggests it would now also include an {{ios}} folder which contains a {{alloy_generated}} file.\r\n\r\nI think it would be better to do the check (and have the {{alloy_generated}} file in the root of {{/platform}} and not in the platform folders. It would then:\r\n\r\n* Already have failed to build when I started working on IOS after the upgrade.\r\n* The warning would not be confusing since it would only show on the second build after dealing with...\r\n* The error would not be confusing since it is about the root folder and not the platform one.\r\n* The {{/platform/ios}} would not have been generated, easing the relocation.",
