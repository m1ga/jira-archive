					"body": "Hi Sharif,\r\n\r\nI currently have 31 clients who each have their own app. The functionality is the same for each App. The only difference between the Apps are the graphics like the launch icon and the splash screens, and also tiapp.xml and manifest.\r\n\r\nSo what I do to avoid having 31 sets of the same source code, which would be updated 31 times whenever I make a change, is to use symbolic links or symlinks (shortcuts in Windows terms) to a Base App which contains all the source code and generic graphics. It means whenever I make a change to the Base App, all 31 Apps get the source code change straight away. All I have to do is republish them.\r\n\r\nNow that the platform folder has been placed into the app folder, and gets copied out to the project root directory on Android App compilation, only the files and directories that are NOT symlinks get copied across. This causes the compiler to fail as it can't find the files it requires to build the app. The error looks like this:\r\n\r\n[ERROR] :  Failed to package application:\r\n[ERROR] :  \r\n[ERROR] :  /Users/Peter/Documents/Appcelerator_Studio_Workspace/App1/build/android/res/drawable-mdpi/ic_drawer.png: libpng warning: iCCP: Not recognizing known sRGB profile that has been edited\r\n[ERROR] :  /Users/Peter/Documents/Appcelerator_Studio_Workspace/App1/build/android/res/drawable-hdpi/ic_drawer.png: libpng warning: iCCP: Not recognizing known sRGB profile that has been edited\r\n[ERROR] :  /Users/Peter/Documents/Appcelerator_Studio_Workspace/App1/build/android/res/drawable-xhdpi/ic_drawer.png: libpng warning: iCCP: Not recognizing known sRGB profile that has been edited\r\n[ERROR] :  /Users/Peter/Documents/Appcelerator_Studio_Workspace/App1/build/android/AndroidManifest.xml:4: error: Error: No resource found that matches the given name (at 'theme' with value '@style/Theme.Dark').\r\n\r\nWhen I look at the newly created platform folder in the project root, I can see that all the files that are symlinks in app/platform/ are not there.\r\n\r\nFor example, App 1 has a notification icon for when it receives Push Notifications and is located in app/platform/android/res/drawable-xxhdpi/notification.png. This file is actually a symlink from App1 to the Base App project. The Linux command I used to create the symlink looks like this:\r\n\r\nln -sv ../../../../../../Base\\ App/app/platform/android/res/drawable-xxhdpi/notification.png app/platform/android/res/drawable-xxhdpi/notification.png\r\n\r\nTry creating a symlink under app/platform/android/res/ to a file somewhere outside of the current project and then compile the project for Android and see if that symlink file gets copied across to the project root platform folder.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nPeter",

					"body": "Hi Sharif,\r\n\r\nJust wanted to find out how you are going with this problem. Just to add a bit more information, I replaced all instances of the symlinks in the app/platform/android/res/ folder with the actual files taken from my Base App project and it compiled without error. So that shows that the symlinks are the problem. However, replacing the symlinks is not a long term solution as it means that eventually I could have 100 App projects and if I need to update any graphics that are common to all projects, I would have to do it 100 times. With symlinks, I only have to make the change once in the Base App project and all other projects are updated automatically.\r\n\r\nIf you could look into this further for me, it would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nPeter ",

This problem with the symlinks has only just started occurring since the latest update of Appcelerator Studio which moved the platform folder into the app folder (and then recreates the platform folder in the project root). I am not sure I should reopen that ticket when it doesn't really relate to the problem I am experiencing. \r\n\r\nIn general, Appcelerator Studio works fine with symlinks, just not when it's copying the contents from app/platform to the <project root>/platform folder.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nPeter\r\n",
