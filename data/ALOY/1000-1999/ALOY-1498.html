<h3>Description</h3>

{quote}
As a developer,
I want to be able to create a new Alloy app from a template other than the builtin Alloy sample apps,
So that I can save development time and errors when creating apps that need to conform to corporate (or other) standards.
{quote}

Currently, as a developer, I can create a new Alloy app using
<code><pre>
appc alloy new . --testapp NAME_OF_SAMPLE_APP
</pre></code>


The sample app must exist in the alloy\samples\apps directory.    It would be nice to be able to point add other folders to this, perhaps in a similar way to ti config (paths.commands, paths.hooks, paths.plugins, etc)   Maybe there could be a paths.samples property that could be used by developers to add other sample directories to be searched when using the --testapp parameter.

   Alloy should reference the paths.templates setting from the cli's config.json
   
   See TIMOB-16620
   
   Most likely resolved with a unified cli/alloy tooling.</li>

   Hello [~brentonhouse], Can you follow [~sfeather] comment, see if that helps you? Thanks.</li>

   I believe he was referring to a proposed code change to Alloy.  I don't think Alloy currently references paths.templates.</li>

   Wouldn't this issue be part of the Alloy CLI and not the Titanium CLI?</li>
