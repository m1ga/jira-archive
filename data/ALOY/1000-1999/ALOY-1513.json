		"description": "I would like to create another TSS file in addition to app.tss that is used globally. The reason for this is because my company has multiple apps that need to use the same style rules. I want to extend the app.tss global styling to include a secondary file. The only way I know to use the same styles is to copy-paste our style rules into app.tss, but this causes issues with source control. It's difficult to tell if you have the latest version and difficult to tell why a change was made.\r\n\r\nFrom [this question|http://developer.appcelerator.com/question/182842/can-i-use-a-secondary-global-styling-like-apptss#answer-287785].",

But that is a step to far for this ticket.  Eyes on the prize.\r\n\r\nA big huge yes please this is a massive need and a great idea.",
