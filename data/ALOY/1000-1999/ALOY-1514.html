<h3>Description</h3>

Now that Alloy 1.2 allows to use L() in XML files, this tool must scan XML files, apart the classic JS and TSS files.

I've been tested it and it is not doing it actually.

   After one year no advances on this idea? I think it will be appreciated to don't forget any L() string.
   
   If it's not too complicated, maybe even I can fix it.</li>

   Hi.
   
   I did it by myself, and seems to be working well right now.
   Were only 2 code line.
   
   I made a pull request: <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/alloy/pull/527" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/alloy/pull/527</a></li>
<li>Manuel Conde Vendrell 2014-09-09

   The pull request has been accepted.
   
   Maybe this issue can be closed (or change it to testing).
