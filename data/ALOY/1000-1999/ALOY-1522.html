<h3>Description</h3>

During our build process, we're getting a warning from Alloy:
{noformat}
Non-model file ".eslintrc.json" in models directory
{noformat}

We are using eslint in our project and need to specify some special settings for the model files. I see in the Alloy source code (commands/compile/index.js:934) that this warning is displayed for each file that doesn't match the RegEx (basically any file that doesn't end in "js").

I could avoid the warning by making it an .eslint.js file, but that would mean it would get copied to the final product (which I'd like to avoid). It seems like it would be a nice addition if files that start with a period are skipped and don't produce warnings.

   Hello, Can you provide a sample test case that reproduce the issue? we will look into it. Thanks.</li>
<li>Daniel Pfeiffer 2016-08-15

   I'm attaching a sample project. This is a new Alloy project with a single <code>.eslintrc.json</code> file in the <code>models</code> directory. (<code>.eslintrc.json</code> is a configuration file for ESLint (<a href="http://eslint.org)." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://eslint.org).</a>
   
   When you build this project:
   <code><pre>
   ti build -p ios --build-only --log-level=warn
   </pre></code>
   
   
   You will receive the following warning:
   <code><pre>
   [WARN]  Non-model file ".eslintrc.json" in models directory
   </pre></code>
   
   
   Ideally, the Alloy compiler would ignore files that begin with a period since they would not be model files and are likely configuration files for SVN, ESLint, or other tools.</li>

   Hello, Looking into your zip file. I don't see any .eslintrc.json in the models folder inside app folder. The file looks to be a hidden file. Can you attach the file here. Thanks.</li>
<li>Daniel Pfeiffer 2016-09-12

   Here is the file--I've renamed it for the purposes of attaching it here, but in the provided zip file, this file was located here:
   app/models/.eslintrc.json</li>
