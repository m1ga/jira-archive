<h3>Description</h3>

Currently Alloy uses backbone 0.9.2 as default, and there is an ability to upgrade to 1.1.2 through the config.json as per documentation: [<a href="https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides2/Alloy+Backbone+Migration" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides2/Alloy+Backbone+Migration</a>]. 

However, the current release of backbone is 1.3.3. There should be support for this version in Alloy too.

And I assume it wouldn't hurt updating the default backbone version either, but I guess thats a breaking change and perhaps another ticket.

   Increase priority please. The current build features Backbone@1.1.2 by setting a (nasty) property in app/config.json. It's release date is Feb 20 2014.
   
   Please update to 1.3.3 (currently the latest) in conjunction with the latest Underscore.
   
   P.S.: Personally I'm using Lodash in my whole project, however it might not play nicely with specific Backbone functionalities, so I have the original Underscore library running as well.</li>
