<h3>Description</h3>

Ran <code>nsp check</code>, two alloy dependencies, <code>uglify-js@2.4.15</code> and <code>moment@2.10.6</code>, are returning <code>Regular Expression Denial of Service</code>. 

This ticket is to track the progress of updating uglify-js from 2.4.15 to *2.6.1* and moment.js from 2.10.6 to *2.17.1*.

Note: 
ECMAScript 5.1 doesn't permit newline characters in string literals. It requires <code>\n</code>. According to [903](<a href="https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2/pull/903)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2/pull/903)</a> Uglify also doesn't like it in versions 2.6.2 and after, thus failed some of the test apps. For now, updating to uglify-js@2.6.1 should correct nsp errors. We need to look into alloy compiler if we need a major uglify upgrade.

   Did the moment.js that is used at runtime get updated as well?  I know there is a bug in the shipped version that has hit a lot of devs.</li>

   [~brentonhouse], which version of Alloy contains the bug you mentioned? Is there a ticket for the bug?</li>
<li>Brenton House 2017-02-27

   It's a bug in the old version of momentjs.  I will look up the bug number. </li>

   [~brentonhouse], momentjs fix went into to version [2.14.0](<a href="https://github.com/moment/moment/pull/3177)." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/moment/moment/pull/3177).</a> Alloy momentjs builtin is at 2.16.0.</li>

   Thanks [~fmiao]!  I wasn't paying close enough attention!  We were probably dealing with it before that version of Alloy got bundled with the Appcelerator SDK.</li>

   [~brentonhouse], no worries, really appreciate it! :)</li>
