<h3>Description</h3>

Every time I use the Alloy FlexSpace component I get a warning.

*Code:*

<code><pre>
&lt;TextField id="txtAmount" class="labelOrange label18Bold keyboardNumber"&gt;
            &lt;KeyboardToolbar&gt;
               &lt;Toolbar&gt;
                  &lt;Items&gt;
                     &lt;FlexSpace /&gt;
                     &lt;Button style="Ti.UI.iOS.SystemButtonStyle.DONE" onClick="onDoneClick"&gt;Done&lt;/Button&gt;
                  &lt;/Items&gt;
               &lt;/Toolbar&gt;
            &lt;/KeyboardToolbar&gt;
         &lt;/TextField&gt;
</pre></code>

*WARNING:*
{noformat}
[WARN]  Ti.UI.iPhone.SystemButton.FLEXIBLE_SPACE DEPRECATED in 5.4.0, in favor of Ti.UI.iOS.SystemButton.FLEXIBLE_SPACE
{noformat}

You might have to change it to the new API's.

   Hello, This is an warning. The app should build without any error. Thanks.</li>

   It is building without any error, but it would be better not to have any warning as well. That's why I put the "type" of the ticket as "IMPROVEMENT" not "BUG"

   Please update your project. 
   
   That warning because, you are trying to use Deprecated functions. 
   
   Thanks </li>
<li>Thomas Neerup 2016-11-01

   So <FlexSpace /> is deprecated?
   Please tell me what to use instead.
   <FixedSpace> dont seem to work anymore, tested on 5.5.1</li>

   This should not be closed. This is an Alloy issue not a user project issue. I see the same WARN messages in my app using 6.0.1. Alloy is generating deprecated code when you use the <FlexSpace/> tag.
   
   To Sharif -- you're right it's a warning not an error. But, Alloy should be updated to no longer generate the deprecated API call.
   
   To Mostafizur -- this code is being generated by Alloy. There's nothing users of your tool can do to have it generate the proper code. So, your comment is just meaningless.</li>

   This is a valid issue, caused by Alloy probably using the deprecated <code>Ti.UI.iPhone</code> namespace instead of <code>Ti.UI.iOS</code>. Although I think it's fixed for latest Alloy, I'll move to Alloy for further investigation next sprint.</li>

   Update: Checked this. [~nunocostapt] did an [Alloy PR](<a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/alloy/pull/798)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/alloy/pull/798)</a> last September to fix all deprecated API calls in Alloy. This should not occur in latest Alloy anymore and I cannot reproduce it. [~acvauctions], which Alloy /Ti version are you testing with? The patch was in Alloy 1.9.3 and SDK 6.0.0, see ALOY-1520.</li>

   Below is what I'm running. I was seeing the WARN messages when generating a non-platform app and thus using 1.9.0. I see that my platform-generated apps are using the <code>UI.iOS</code> namespace properly. Sorry, I always forget that you guys embed separate versions within the appc/platform environment (a decision I didn't like back when I worked there and suggested then that it would cause confusion and issues).
   
   <code><pre>
   ≫ alloy -v
   1.9.0
   
   ≫ appc alloy -v
   1.9.5
   </pre></code></li>
</ol>
