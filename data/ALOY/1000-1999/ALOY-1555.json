		"description": "Customer is having following question about core.js in Alloy proejct. Please help to provide a proper answer.\r\n\r\nA single window core.js  was used in the app mentioned in the blog, http://www.appcelerator.com/blog/2014/06/now-app/, which is the actual link which has the multi window approach.\r\n\r\nIt was not updated from the past three years. \r\nIf it is good, people should be talking about it everywhere and updating it frequently.\r\nSo, I am a bit skeptical about it. \r\n\r\nI have a few questions for you. \r\n\r\nDoes appcelerator use it in all their apps or was it used only in that particular app mentioned in the blog?\r\nIs the advisable to use it in all our apps as a standard navigation framework?\r\nIs it good enough to use in very complex apps?\r\nIs it good enough at least for simple apps?\r\n\r\nPlease share your inputs on when it can be used and when it cannot be used.\r\n",
