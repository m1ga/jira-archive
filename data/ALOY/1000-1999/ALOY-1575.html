<h3>Description</h3>

We added refresh-control for Android in TIMOB-1072, but we also need Android to use the Alloy <RefreshControl> tag.

   [~hknoechel], [~jquick] does this API work differently from iOS? If it's the same usage as in iOS, then no changes are needed in alloy. Otherwise what's the difference? </li>

   [~fmiao],
   
   The only differences between Android and iOS are:
   - Android ignores the "RefreshControl.title" property.
   - The Android RefreshControl does not support ScrollView. (Will log a warning if you try and then no-op.)
   
   No one here has tried testing it with Alloy on Android.</li>

   [~fmiao] I actually think we should be fine then. If people use properties on Android that are documented as iOS-only in the docs, they would always run into an error, that was the same before and happens in the native world as well. If it all works without changes, we can resolve it as Invalid.</li>

   Closing as invalid. If this is incorrect, please reopen.</li>
