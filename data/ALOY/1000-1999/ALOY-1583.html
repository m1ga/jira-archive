   We are in the [process of moving from underscore to lodash](<a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/alloy/pull/842)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/alloy/pull/842)</a> (more advanced and up-to-date). But as it's a breaking change, we may integrate this in Alloy 1.x. [~cwilliams] [~fmiao] thoughts? </li>

   By looking at the migration guide for lodash there really are a lot of migration steps to take. So this would really help on short term:

   As discussed in the linked PR, we will replace underscore with lodash in Alloy 2.0.0 which has a PR linked to TIMOB-24980.</li>
