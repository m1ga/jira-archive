<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Description</h4>

While fixing TIMOB-26781 I ran into an issue where on a reload, the code for pulling a fresh file via the LiveView would log <code>[ERROR] TiHTTPClient: (main) [252,94480] Could not decode response text</code>, chasing that down it appears that when we do selective compilation on windows the platform specific app.js file (Resources/android/app.js) gets removed by Alloy, but not regenerated causing LiveView to fallback to the empty (Resources/app.js)

<h4>Steps to reproduce</h4>

*You must be using SDK 8*

1. Build an Alloy app with LiveView enabled
2. Once launched make some changes and save.

<h4>Actual</h4>

The app attempts to reload, <code>[ERROR] TiHTTPClient: (main) [230,6739] Could not decode response text</code> gets logged to console. <code>Resources/android/app.js</code> does not exist.

<h4>Expected</h4>

The app should reload, and work as normal,  <code>Resources/android/app.js</code>  should exist

   It looks like the "orphanage" is removing the app.js/alloy.js files on Windows rebuilds, but not on mac os rebuilds</li>

   This looks to be down to walk-sync always returning paths with posix separators, while (as expected and is correct) we construct paths using the platforms separator and when comparing the comparison fails because <code>android/app.js !== android\app.js</code>. The two solutions are
   
   * Keep using walk-sync and always call <code>path.resolve</code> when working with the path
   * Move to klaw-sync which returns paths correctly for the platform
   
   I'm going to go for the former because it's less churn.</li>

   Closing ticket fix verified in SDK version <code>8.0.0.v20190211161538</code> and CLI version <code>7.0.10-master.14</code>. Able to build an Android application with LiveView enabled and once changes were made and then saved the application would reflect changes.</li>
