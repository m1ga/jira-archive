<h3>Description</h3>

The way that Alloy copies <code>lib/</code> files results in source maps being generated, but the copied lib file has no pointer to the source map. It should have a <code>//# sourceMappingURL=</code> comment appended which points to the full file path of the generated source map file.

Additionally, the generated source maps **may not be correct** based on the optimizer plugin being run as a post-process "Optimizer" step.

Ideally the files should be processed by Babel, spit out a source map, have a comment appended to the generated contents pointing at the map file, and then written to disk (all as a single process/flow per-file) and not included in the later "optimizing" step.

Instead Alloy does this:
- copies the file as-is (no <code>//# sourceMappingURL=</code> comment!)
- immediately generates a 1:1 source map to represent the copy
- later runs an "optimizing step" on some of the files under the <code>Resources/</code> directory (including the ones from <code>lib/</code>!) which **may** result in the source map now being incorrect
