But I'm looking for actual examples and _why_ we should add this.\r\n\r\nI'm not convinced authoring JS inside Alloy XML tags is a great DX, I like the idea of referencing a file though. \r\n\r\nEdit:\r\n\r\nI just wanted to add why I think that allowing embedded code isn't a great DX. If you're writing JS in a XML file, Studio nor the editor plugins will highlight the correctly, sure we can add it to the 3 things, but knowing the context there it's easier said then done.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, including this into the debugging experience will require some work. Our sourcemaps for Alloy are already a bit of a minefield, including another file (which is XML) only makes that more complex, and requires more logic by the debuggers to correctly resolve things. I think we will have to solve this for the file reference solution too.\r\n\r\nAgain both of those problems I outlined are possible to do, but I don't think the value of embedded code is worth the cost of them (and there's probably some more integration points I'm missing)",
