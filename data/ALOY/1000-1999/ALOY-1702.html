<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Description</h4>

In 8.2.0 we introduced support for SFSymbols and Semantic Colors, these are both accessed via methods <code>Ti.UI.iOS.systemImage</code> and <code>Ti.UI.fetchSemanticColor</code> respectively. There's no great user story currently for consuming these in XML views or TSS.

I think there's 2 avenues for supporting theses, either allow their direct usage or invent a shorthand (Ã  la <code>L()</code>) for them. 

I think it's possible that we may want to restrict <code>Ti.UI.iOS.systemImage</code> to TSS only though, as this needs to be gated in a version check (or maybe we can get inventive and add this to the generated code ourselves?)

I'll update this ticket with some proposals after some research
