					"body": "[~bhouse], Webpack uses an enhanced resolve mechanism, so things like {{@widget/utils}} are perfectly valid. The {{@widget}} is just a path alias and Webpack falls back to the default node resolve algorithm using {{@widget}} as the scope if it won't find anything under the alias. Prefixing aliases in Webpack with either {{@}} or {{~}} is common practice. Using those character alone generally is used as an alias to the {{src}} or {{asset}} directories of a project. I used the same [alias configuration|https://github.com/appcelerator/appcd-plugin-webpack/blob/9f2f03cc5b88e958abb9ddefad4e19fe36f4b88b/src/config/alloy.js#L39] in our Webpack configs as well. To properly distinguish between the project source alias and the one for widgets i chose {{@widget}}.\r\n\r\nAlthough {{@widget}} is not very much of a shortcut, IMHO it's still much easier to write than the cumbersome {{WPATH()}}. And since this is all just a Webpack alias configuration we can easily add a short version like {{@w}}.",
