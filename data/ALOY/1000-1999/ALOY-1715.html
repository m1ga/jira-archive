<h3>Description</h3>

After the patch which required you to move the folders <code>i18n</code> and <code>platform</code> into <code>/app</code>, the legacy folders were being created after a build with one tag-file named <code>alloy_generated</code>.

This makes little sense and I suggest generating those files into the <code>build</code> directory since that is where they belong. Having more generated directories in the root of your project requires people to add more <code>.gitignore</code> rules

   This ticket is referring to the changes made in ALOY-1365.
   
   I get what you're saying. Generating the <code>i18n</code> and <code>platform</code> folder in the root of your project is a hack. It's because the Titanium build only knows to look in the root of your project for those folders. Sadly, there is no way to hook into the build to modify this behavior.
   
   FWIW, we did add <code>/i18n</code> and <code>/platform</code> to the <code>.gitignore</code> for new projects: <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/alloy/blob/master/templates/two_tabbed/.gitignore#L3-L4." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/alloy/blob/master/templates/two_tabbed/.gitignore#L3-L4.</a>
   
   The bad news is we will not be fixing this in Alloy 1.x.
   
   The good news is we will totally fix this in Alloy 2! We're going to bring Alloy into the Titanium build and this means Alloy apps will benefit from the latest build features and speed improvements. Follow the ticket here \-\-> TIMOB-20341 <\-\-</li>

   I certainly like the idea of integrating Alloy into the Titanium SDK, however it seems like a cumbersome task that is likely months away from completion. Then again, if there is no way to change this at the moment then I guess we'll have to wait for 2.0.</li>
