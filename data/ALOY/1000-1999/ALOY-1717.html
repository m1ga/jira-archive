<h3>Description</h3>

When working on a new Alloy project, I noticed some weird project structures regarding Android:
- We use the <code>DefaultIcon.png</code> to generate the density-specific app-icons, but there still is a <code>app/assets/android/appicon.png</code> which should not be there by default
- We generate the density-specific folders, but only from ldpi to hdpi, not xhdpi, xxhdpi and xxxhdpi. Those should be generated as well
- Do we even support ldpi resolutions anymore? Which devices with Android 4.4 have that low density values? 
- Should we have a "default.png" have a 320x480px resolution? How does Android does that natively?

I just want to ensure we don't copy something that isn't actually needed.
