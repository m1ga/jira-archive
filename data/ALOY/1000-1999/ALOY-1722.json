We never should have built a tool that we would have to spawn a new process for and have to serialize all input when it was going into a Titanium plugin.  This can be avoided by always having your alloy cli code call require on the main alloy file.  That way the alloy cli supports both.   As it is right now, we have no context sharing between Titanium and Alloy.  Titanium knows all kinds of info about native modules, etc and the only way for Alloy to get that information is to reparse files and recreate the work that was done in Titanium.",

The thing is that Alloy does not really has such an API and everything is designed around Alloy being called as a CLI as the main entry.
