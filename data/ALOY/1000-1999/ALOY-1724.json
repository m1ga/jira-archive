					"body": "[~nvishnoi] thanks for raising the ticket. Only valid tickets go to the TIMOB project in Jira. This is the inbox so it is the correct location.\r\n\r\nYou can already do global events using {{Ti.App.addEvenListener}} and {{Ti.App.fireEvent}}. You could trigger the event from every window and monitor it at a central place. Something like {{Ti.App.fireEvent(\"closewindow\", payload)}}\r\n\r\nAn even better method of globals events would be using Backbone events, so you don't need to \"cross the bridge\" for every event. See this blog post: https://devblog.axway.com/mobile-apps/global-app-events-in-titanium-using-backbone-js/\r\n\r\nIf this doesn't answer your question, feel free to reply. Otherwise, I think we can close this ticket! \r\n\r\nIn case you're not in the community yet, join it at https://tislack.org. This is a perfect place for a question like this",

I agree that Ti.App.addEventListener and Ti.App.fireEvent should not be used (due to bridge crossing).   I am not aware of this being possible with using Backbone events, but maybe I am missing something.\r\n\r\nI think this would be a great feature to add to Alloy as it would only require a few lines of code and would allow even more extensibility.\r\n",
