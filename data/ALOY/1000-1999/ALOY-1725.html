<h3>Description</h3>

For Webpack support the Alloy compiler was refactored and moved into a standalone package for easier access in other tooling. This works needs to be folded back into the main Alloy package.

   [~jvennemann], I can't remember how we decided to approach this? Were we initially going to create a <code>next</code> branch and merge the PR to that, and publish under the <code>@next</code> tag on npm?
   
   Then I think we could integrate with the appc cli, and publish a pre-release build in production to allow us to try and get some feedback.</li>

   Yes, i think we settled for that. I will have to rebase the PR against that branch then. That way we can maintain the 1.X branch for any bug fixes and go wild on the next branch to get some structure into the repo.</li>

   Created the [next branch](<a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/alloy/tree/next)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/alloy/tree/next)</a> and changed the PR to target that. I think it's probably easiest to focus on landing this PR onto next, and then hooking up Jenkins to publish to avoid causing any new conflicts</li>
