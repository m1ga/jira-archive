<h3>Description</h3>

When creating a widget it is common to have more than one view, style, controller set.  Given the nature of a widget the elements would share a common style.  However there is no current way to define a "widget wide" tss file as there is with the "app wide" app.tss file.

This means that the author has two choose between two poor coding techniques;

- Duplicate the common styles for each tss file within the widget
- Pollute the app.tss solely for the benefit of the widget/

This reduces the ability for a widget to fulfil the part of its original goal which was to be DRY and re-usable.  The above problem highlights the lack or restrictions of re-usability.

   I've run in to this all the time and have had customers mention this as well.  This is a necessary feature from POV.</li>

   +1 - I agree with Rick, this would be a great feature.</li>

   Is there another way to have widget-wide styles that has been implemented already?  cc: [~amukherjee] [~eharris]</li>

   This isn't supported to my knowledge (and I can't find any other tickets referencing this). It does totally seem useful to me, but I think we'd have to be careful on how this is implemented as no doubt whichever road which pick will break someone</li>
