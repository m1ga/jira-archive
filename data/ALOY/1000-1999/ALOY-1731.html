<h3>Description</h3>

The Alloy loader uses [addDependency](<a href="https://webpack.js.org/api/loaders/#thisadddependency)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://webpack.js.org/api/loaders/#thisadddependency)</a> to define dependencies of Alloy components. This is used to re-compile a component if it's view or styles changes. However, this can cause unwanted behavior in certain cases:

- If a component has no .tss file, it will constantly be recompiled when another component triggers a rebuild. This is because Webpack thinks it needs to recompile it as well, since its style file was missing, and it may have been created in the meantime.
- We could check if the style file actually exists before adding it as a dependency to prevent these unwanted rebuilds. But if a user now creates the style file, Webpack won't trigger the recompile for the component because it doesn't now about the dependency.

To address this a solution needs to be found that allows to add all dependencies of a component while also preventing unnecessary rebuilds.
