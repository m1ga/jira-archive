<h3>Description</h3>

As a new developer, coming to the alloy repository can be quite irritating, because the latest release is marked with 2015, although there is still a vivid development around it. Therefore, two things could be done to "Make Alloy releases great again":

1. Mark the latest release (e.g. 1.15.0) as actually latest
2. Include the changelog in the releases page (same for Titanium itself btw - open source developers use that page as their primary source of releases)

See a few screenshots attached (Alloy right now vs Vue.js)

   I think this is a fair request for Alloy as we can release an OSS Alloy version a few weeks before it eventually is published via the appc CLI. However, I don't want us creating more work by making this a manual step otherwise it can easily get forgotten about (case in point, I see vue is now at 2.6.12 but the latest is still marked as 2.6.11 ;)).
   
   I think we can potentially use semantic-release to achieve automating this, it just means we'll get a little stricter on commit message syntax.
   
   I'll leave titanium_mobile as a separate discussion (I can split off to a separate ticket if wanted), personally I think that the releases we do would be too large to list fully on GitHub and that maybe a link to the blog/release notes/changelog would be better suited there</li>

   PR: <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/alloy/pull/980" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/alloy/pull/980</a>
   
   This configures semantic-release on the alloy repo, it will handle the releasing of the package and also tag and create releases for us on GitHub.
   
   You can see an example of the releases here <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium-editor-commons/releases" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium-editor-commons/releases</a></li>

   PR merged, from our next release onwards we'll start producing GitHub releases with the associated changelog</li>
