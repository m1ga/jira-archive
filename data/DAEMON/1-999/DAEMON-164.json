Go into the sdk's platform tools directory. Run {{appcd exec /android/latest/info/devices --subscribe}} and then rename {{adb}} to {{adb2}} which will trigger {{adb}} disappearing. Change it back and it'll redetect Android devices. This should also work if you move the entire Android SDK directory from some undiscoverable directories such as subdir on your desktop, then move it to a discoverable directory such as {{/opt}}.\r\n\r\nThe list of devices should become empty if {{adb}} disappears.\r\n\r\nNote that on macOS and Linux, if {{adb}} is running, then you can do whatever you want to the executable on disk and {{adb}} will still be running. This is fine.\r\n\r\nAnother thing to test is subscribe to devices and then run {{adb kill-server}}. The daemon will say the devices are empty, then attempt to restart adb in 2 seconds. After a few more seconds, the list of devices will be refreshed.",
