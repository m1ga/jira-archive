<h3>Description</h3>

The Titanium Appc Daemon plugin facilitates all Titanium-related functionality: SDK detection, creating projects, building projects, and getting/setting project settings.

The Titanium plugin detects all installed Titanium SDKs. It defaults to the latest SDK, unless otherwise specified.

It is also responsible for communicating with the AMPLIFY platform service and enforcing the platform session and entitlements.

It will support the "new", "build", and "project" commands. Each command's logic is implemented by controllers inside the Titanium SDK. Each controller deals with the overall logic and delegates the platform specific logic to a platform "backend".

When using an older Titanium SDK that doesn't support the Appc Daemon, the request is translated into a Titanium CLI command and run as a subprocess. Features such as prompting will be disabled.
