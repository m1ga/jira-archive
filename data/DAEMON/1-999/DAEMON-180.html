   This is not a daemon issue. Your daemon instance was running for approximately 8 hours. You updated to the latest Appc CLI core, but it appears "appc use" didn't stop the daemon, which was just implemented in CLI-1285. Your Appc CLI core probably doesn't have this latest feature. You would have had to manually stop the daemon after switching the Appc CLI core version.</li>

   Manually stopping and starting Deamon (before and after update of CLI) didn't resolve the issue. 
   
   Kondal found out that appcd is picking old version of Deamon (it was taking 1.0.0-10 until we resolved it, as explained below) and thereby causing the ios and other modules to be unfound et.al.
   
   *_How did it get resolved? _*
   I had to search for appcd in system processes (*_ps -ef | grep appcd_*) and kill the long running *appcd-plugin-host *processes. These plugin-host processes had been running for almost a week.
   Once these processes were killed, I did initiated appcd with appc appcd start command and everything started to work normally.
