<h3>Description</h3>

When the daemon is not already started and we launch studio then a lot of flicker is noticed as if few independent windows trying to open and close.
This seems to happen when dashboard starts to launch upon studio launch and hence requests to daemon are being sent for start and system-info

If the daemon is already started or we try to restart studio the flicker is not noticed.

   [~eharris] [~cbarber] I've seen this issue when we start the daemon from the terminal from the Windows machine. Can you guys please check this.</li>

   Looked at this a little and believe it's due to use spawning appcd as a detached process (so this doesnt happen during a gulp watch, or appcd start --debug)
   
   I think as we're spawning off the node process there we're at the whim of node spawning the console window it's a well known issue [pm2](<a href="https://github.com/Unitech/pm2/issues/2182)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/Unitech/pm2/issues/2182)</a>, [node](<a href="https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/7653)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/7653)</a>, we added windowsHide which stopped the consoles from staying around (DAEMON-99) but the flash stuck around.
   
   I'm gonna leave this to Chris as I vaguely remember him mentioning that it's possible he's solved this issue in titanium at some point, ultimately though I think a nodew.exe similar to javaw.exe might solve this properly but there is [little movement](<a href="https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/556)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/556)</a></li>

   I'm not sure how to address this other than Studio blocking on starting the daemon and querying the system-info as to not do too much at one time, which is not ideal.
   
   The thing I was mentioning to Ewan was about suppressing the console window when launching the Android emulator. It's not really applicable here.</li>
