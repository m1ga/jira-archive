<h3>Description</h3>

The Titanium iOS build backend is responsible for hooking into the build controller and handling iOS specific processing including building, installing, and running apps.

Change all references of "iphone" to "ios". This primarily addresses directory names, but couple apply to other things. Options of "iphone" will continue to work, but should be scheduled for deprecation.

All resources such as JS files and images will be added to the Xcode project. The allows apps to be built from Xcode and used with Xcode's development tools such as Instruments. The iOS build will rely on Xcode to copy the assets into the target app directory and maintain the build state. This will also solve TIMOB-19818.

When performing a simulator build, the iOS Simulator should be launched as soon as the build starts so the app can be immediately installed after the app is built.
