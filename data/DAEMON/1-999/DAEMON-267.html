   Upon investigating this feature, it turns out to not be feasible.
   
   Essentially, we are using a Websocket as the communication mechanism between the client and the Appc Daemon and requests are similar to HTTP where we fire a request and get a single or multi-chunk response.
   
   To support multiple requests tied to a single request, we would need to track and route messages based on a request id. This would likely be limiting and complicated.
   
   Instead, we recommend that appcd plugins start their own special purpose server that facilitates the bidirectional requests and use the existing appcd request and routing system for discovery of this service.</li>
