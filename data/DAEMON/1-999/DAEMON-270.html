<h3>Description</h3>

*Steps To Reproduce:*
1.Run  appcd command in terminal
<code><pre>
appc appcd restart
</pre></code>
*Expected:*
Daemon should be restarted 
*Actual:*
The daemon refuses to start and throws error
An uncaught exception was thrown!
Cannot destructure property <code>filesize</code> of 'undefined' or 'null'.
Cannot destructure property <code>filesize</code> of 'undefined' or 'null'.
*Note1:*
For me when I changed the cli to 7.0.9 ,it worked fine.
*Note 2:*
For Josh Quick ,this happens with CLI v7.0.9 also and he tried with node v8.9.3 and v10.15.0
â€‹ It also causes Appc Studio to beach ball forever

   This error stems from <code>snooplogg@2.x</code> which removed <code>humanize</code>, <code>moment</code>, <code>figures</code>, and <code>pluralize</code> dependencies because there were never used by <code>snooplogg</code> other than simply re-exported. This bloated <code>snooplogg</code> and hence why there were removed.
   
   When the Appc Daemon was updated to <code>snooplogg@2.x</code>, the various packages which depended on those former <code>snooplogg</code> dependencies were updated. <code>appcd-logger</code> is the only package that directly depends on <code>snooplogg</code>. When <code>appcd-logger</code> was updated to <code>snooplogg@2.x</code>, it should have been bumped a major version, but instead was only bumped a minor version.
   
   Because of this, older versions of the daemon would use <code>appcd-logger@1.1.4</code> and in turn pulled in <code>snooplogg@2.0.1</code> which was the version the stripped unused dependencies.
   
   To resolve this, <code>appcd-logger@1.x</code> needed to revert the upgrade to <code>snooplogg@2.x</code>. The commit is here: <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/appc-daemon/commit/4814d93a373f47fc6602361c34b0a53d3ea500e2." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/appc-daemon/commit/4814d93a373f47fc6602361c34b0a53d3ea500e2.</a>
   
   <code>appcd-logger@1.1.4</code> has been republished as <code>appcd-logger@2.0.0</code>
   
   Since <code>appcd-logger@1.1.4</code> cannot be unpublished, so <code>appcd-logger@1.1.3</code> was re-published as <code>appcd-logger@1.1.5</code>, which makes <code>appcd@1.x</code> happy.</li>

   New appc cli @ 7.0.10-master.6 in preprod should contain these fixes . Will verify later</li>
<li>Samir Mohammed 2019-01-25

   Verified in 7.0.10-master.6. Unable to se the above uncaught exception and Activity Monitor shows the 'appcd' process.</li>
