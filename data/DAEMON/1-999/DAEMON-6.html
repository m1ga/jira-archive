<h3>Description</h3>

androidlib, ioslib, jdklib, and windowslib need a filesystem monitoring library that can be notified when a specific path changes.

Node has a built-in <code>fs.watch()</code> function which works fine on Linux and Windows, but doesn't work well on OS X where it doesn't report the correct file path. This can be fixed by using the <code>fsevents</code> module.

The <code>chokidar</code> module comes close to solving this need, but I discovered two blocking bugs: one with watching paths that do not exist and one with nested paths. It also currently has 39 open issues, some of which are a little scary sounding. Additionally, <code>chokidar</code> uses <code>readdirp</code> which apparently has performance issues due to all of the file stating.
