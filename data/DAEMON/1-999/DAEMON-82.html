<h3>Description</h3>

Recursive fs watching works good... perhaps a little too good. When it recursively watches a directory, it has to walk the directory and watch every single descendant. This takes a bunch of resources and slow to initialize. Sometimes the only thing you are interested in is just a couple directories deep. It would best if the FSWatcher could watch only to a certain depth.
