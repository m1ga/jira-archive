The FB button works fine for the FIRST login and logout.  Subsequent logouts do not seem to fire the eventlistener as the alert does not state \"logged out\" and the button remains visible.

This is a Facebook-themed button that does not require a click event handler or any listeners. Click events on the button are automatically handled by the Facebook module.\n\nThe button changes its label to reflect the current state of the Facebook session. For example, if the user is already logged in, this button will show \"Logout\".",

					"body": "The primary reason is to dictate the visibility of a button that allows you to post to FB.   If logged in, show it, if not, don't.  This is also consistent with your examples from the updated FB module found here: http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#!/api/Modules.Facebook (and shown below) where you encourage developers to listen for login and logout events.  The lack of a click listener won't help with any application flow that is predicated on the logged status (in / out).  As an update to this ticket I am using the button on a view.  I can't tell from the documentation if that is contributing to the issue (I can't see why it would).  I should also add that as an additional test I called the getLoggedIn status and could see states being returned consistent with what they should have been based on the FB button state.  In other words, if I was logged out the FB button returns to the correct state and getLoggedIn shows false (the buttons appearance is correct for both states).  However, the listener for the logout does not appear to fire.  I think those event listeners are useful - unless there is another way to accomplish what I am trying to do without them.\r\n\r\n\r\nExamples\r\nAuthorize\r\n\r\nShows official Facebook dialog for logging in the user and prompting the user to approve your requested permissions. Listen for the module's login event to determine whether the request succeeded.\r\n\r\nvar fb = require('facebook');\r\nfb.appid = FACEBOOK_APP_ID;\r\nfb.permissions = ['publish_stream']; // Permissions your app needs\r\nfb.forceDialogAuth = true;\r\nfb.addEventListener('login', function(e) {\r\n    if (e.success) {\r\n        alert('Logged In');\r\n    } else if (e.error) {\r\n        alert(e.error);\r\n    } else if (e.cancelled) {\r\n        alert(\"Canceled\");\r\n    }\r\n});\r\nfb.authorize();\r\n\r\nLogout\r\n\r\nLogout the user and forget the authorization token. The logout event is fired after the user is logged out.\r\n\r\nfb.addEventListener('logout', function(e) {\r\n    alert('Logged out');\r\n});\r\nfb.logout();",

					"body": "More information for this ticket.  I have found that if I close the window with the Facebook button and re-open it the logout event listener will fire.  However, it will not fire if I keep the window open.  The window in question that contains the view container for the button is being opened in a modal state.  Steps to replicate:\n\n1. Make a window that launches another modal window from a UI control\n2. Create the window that opens in modal mode from the first screen\n3. Add a view\n4. Add a \"back\" button that closes the modal window to the view\n5. Add a FB button to the view\n6. Add a button to the view with visibility set to fb.getLoggedIn.\n7. Add event listeners for FB login and logout with code to change the visibility of the button to true if logged in and false if logged out.\n8. Optional: add alert messages for \"login\" and \"logout\" to the FB event listeners. \n\nYou should see that the logout listener will not fire unless you close the modal window and reopen it.\n ",
