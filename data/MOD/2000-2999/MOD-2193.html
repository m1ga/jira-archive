   Hello,
   
   Deferred deep linking is a term used to describe one aspect of mobile deep linking is the process of deep linking but when the end user does not have the app installed and must install the app in order to access the in-app content. This can be added as a new feature.
   
   Thanks.

   Pushing to a later release for now, since the comments could not be addressed in the 5.4.0 timeframe. Anyway, as soon as they are addressed, we can merge it and publish a new standalone ti.facebook release including the change. Thanks!</li>

   @hansknoechel what's missing?</li>
<li>Hans Knöchel 2016-04-26

   The branch has merge problems (<a href="https://github.com/appcelerator-modules/ti.facebook/pull/39)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator-modules/ti.facebook/pull/39)</a> so you would probably just need to pull from latest master to resolve them. And you talked about a crash occurring, was that resolved? *EDIT*: Oh, the NSURL made problems, you fixed it correctly!
   
   We still have this week to get it in, so it's all good! Just wanted to prepare for the case we won't make it. Thanks!</li>

   Demo:
   <code><pre>
   var fb = require('facebook');
   fb.fetchDeferredAppLink(function(e) {
       if (e.success) {
           // Dispatch internal routes
       }
   });
   </pre></code></li>

    Ran this test code and couldn't find anything returned, what should I be expecting from this test case? </li>

   Verified as fixed, Note that it may take a while for Deferred App Link requests to show in the Analytics Dashboard of your Facebook App.
