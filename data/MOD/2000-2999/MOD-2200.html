<h3>Description</h3>

I am aiming to get a list of a users friends in order to invite them to use our app but this is no longer possible in Graph API v2.0. The user/friends endpoint now only returns friends who also use the app.

This is a design decision from Facebook and so the Titanium documented route of using presentSendRequestDialog is no longer possible for this purpose.

Facebook instead now forward me to use their new service 'App Invites', however I don't believe that this has been incorporated into the Titanium module yet.

   Hello, 
   
   This is an interesting feature request. With this feature anyone can integrate App Invites into their app in place where people want to invite friends to your app. When the person taps the Invite button, the feature can trigger the flow to send invites.
   
   You need to know that the new feature request is a lengthy process and it takes time release a version of the feature. The request needs to be pass by the deciding committee before it moves to developing phase. Currently, we have pending requests in out pipeline. 
   
   We will let you know if and when we will release the version with the feature. 
   
   Thanks.

   [~martz256] Just added the dialog as part of <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator-modules/ti.facebook/pull/43" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator-modules/ti.facebook/pull/43</a>, you can test it already if you want:
   <code><pre>
   fb.presentInviteDialog({
     appLink: "<a href="https://www.mydomain.com/myapplink" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.mydomain.com/myapplink</a>",
     appPreviewImageLink: "<a href="https://www.mydomain.com/my_invite_image.jpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.mydomain.com/my_invite_image.jpg</a>"
   });
   </pre></code></li>

   Reopening issue, since I did something wrong with the event naming handling caused by [this commit](<a href="https://github.com/appcelerator-modules/ti.facebook/pull/43/commits/0a64db8cc9ab2f80b8995b76cd14ce6da05f1c64)." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator-modules/ti.facebook/pull/43/commits/0a64db8cc9ab2f80b8995b76cd14ce6da05f1c64).</a> Resulting from that, all events (share/invite/gamerequest) are delivered in the "requestDialogCompleted" event, which is incorrect. Fix on it's way.</li>

   PR Approved and merged. [~hansknoechel] please remember to do a PR with the new packaged Facebook module, after the android PR is merged.</li>

   Verified as fixed, I was able to send an App Invite through Facebook using the latest Facebook Module. However bear in mind that App Invites won't be received by the recipient unless the app itself is published.
