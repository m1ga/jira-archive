<h3>Description</h3>

We need to have an official way to deal with conflicting jars in Android development. Furthermore, this needs to be clearly documented in both Hyperloop and non-hyperloop module creation documentation. Furthermore, Android module development needs to use Gradle and have documentation on how to do so. We, the Appcelerator Dev community are ready to jump overboard if this issue is not solved soon!

   I was discussing this with @Sean Conway earlier today and of how I can't build my Titanium app for Android with PushWoosh module because it's conflicting with ti.map and maybe a few other modules. Stripping the jar files is a very primitive work (since there are no decent tools to do that) and very inconsistent too (I managed to do a few months ago, pushwoosh often crashed).
   
   ps.: Why don't my mentions work here? haha
