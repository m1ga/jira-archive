<h3>Description</h3>

Can we have basic image filters like brightness, contrast, sepia, etc. integrated into the existing image factory module for iOS and Android? This would really be helpful to a lot of developers as I have seen from the google search results that a lot of people had looked out for something similar but there was no concrete module available.

There are a couple of modules on marketplace but unfortunately they are only iOS based. We can have one module for all the functionality related to images.

   Thanks for the request. Our engineering team will consider it. </li>

   There is an iOS module to support the <code>GPUImage</code> library on iOS [here](<a href="https://github.com/hansemannn/titanium-image-filters)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/hansemannn/titanium-image-filters)</a>, feel free to do the Android equivalent as well! It will probably stay an own library, since ti.imagefactory is currently more focussed on image manipulation (cropping, sizing) rather than filtering. </li>

   @Hans Knöchel Thanks for the iOS module. Can you please explain how to change brightness by sending values (0.0-1.0) to the module?</li>
<li>Hans Knöchel 2017-04-26

   You can use the <code>GPUImageBrightnessFilter</code> filter, but filter values are not supported in the module so far. Feel free to change the module to do so. *EDIT*: I just added that functionality as well. You can now use <code>createFilter</code> to create a new filter and supply the desired properties like natively. Please just read the native docs carefully, it includes everything you might need.</li>
