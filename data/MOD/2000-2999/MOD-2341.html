<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Issue Description </h4>

We performed a security scan in one of our Android with Cigital.

One of the founding was about Crittercism (included in the APM module) using a vulnerable version on Nginx and they suggested to remove it from the app:

>Disable all connectivity to Crittercism / Apteligent. They are using an known vulnerable version of Nginx. <a href="http://www.appcelerator.com/press-releases/crittercism-partnership-integrate-mobile-app-development-and-performance-platform/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.appcelerator.com/press-releases/crittercism-partnership-integrate-mobile-app-development-and-performance-platform/</a>  

Before doing that, we would like to use the latest version available from Crittercism in case it already has been solved by them. 
(<a href="https://docs.apteligent.com/downloads/downloads.html)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://docs.apteligent.com/downloads/downloads.html)</a>

iOS: v5.6.8
Android: v5.8.1

how can I make sure of that?

If we are not using that version, can we change this ticket to a feature request with engineering to update it?

   What is the vulnerable version of Nginx, what is the security ID of the vulnerability, and what is the version that fixes it?</li>
<li>Ajith Rohini 2017-06-20

   [~rramirez], Can you please check with the client and find the answers for Ingo's questions ?</li>
<li> Ricardo Ramirez 2017-06-20

   The versions affected are:
    
   Titanium SDK: v5.5.1.GA
   com.appcelerator.apm: v1.5
   crittercism-android: v5.3.3
    
   The version of Ngnix is not specified, but it's the same included within that version of the crittercism module, which hasn't been updated in apm v2.</li>

    Current test results with this environment:
    Node Version: 6.10.3
    NPM Version: 3.10.10
    Mac OS: 10.12.4
    Appc CLI: 6.2.2
    Appc CLI NPM: 4.2.9
    Titanium SDK version: 6.1.2.v20170726152015
    Appcelerator Studio, build: 4.9.0.201705302345
    apm module version 2.1.0 (pre-release)
    Android Device 7.1.2
    
    [~gmathews] I tested with the above environment, and found compile-time errors. I attached the log to this ticket as "critterlog.txt". I used the example project in the apm modules folder. When I switched to the released version apm 2.0.0, there were no errors, and the app launched without issues. Can you please take a look?</li>
<li>Gary Mathews 2017-07-27

    [~amukherjee] I don't follow; there is only one [2.1.0](<a href="https://github.com/appcelerator-modules/appcelerator.apm/releases/tag/v2.1.0)." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator-modules/appcelerator.apm/releases/tag/v2.1.0).</a> I can't reproduce the compile errors you are seeing either?</li>
<li>Abir Mukherjee 2017-07-27

    [~gmathews] yes you're right, that was a typo. I tried it with 2.0.0 and it worked fine; it did not work with 2.1.0.</li>
<li>Abir Mukherjee 2017-08-01

    I verified that the new apm module (2.1.0) does work as expected with the environment noted in my previous comment. The issue I reported earlier was due to an unrelated setup issue.</li>
