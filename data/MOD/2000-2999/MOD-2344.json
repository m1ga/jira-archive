I also tried posting different combinations of setNeedsDisplay, invalidatePath, and setNeedsLayout on both the current and main queue for the mapview as well as the overlay renderer.\r\n\r\nThat said, it was a tough bug to reproduce so its possible that this doesnt actually fix things in the end.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nPR: https://github.com/appcelerator-modules/ti.map/pull/205",
