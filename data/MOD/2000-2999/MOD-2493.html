<h3>Description</h3>

Can the ti.admob module please be adjusted to support the new Native Advanced admob ad units?

I think that the ti.admob module will need to introduce a new adType constant of:
<code><pre>
Admob.AD_TYPE_NATIVE_ADVANCED
</pre></code>

which I think could be implemented as follows;
<code><pre>
SWIFT: static let unifiedNative: GADAdLoaderAdType
OBJECTIVE-C: extern const GADAdLoaderAdType _Nonnull kGADAdLoaderAdTypeUnifiedNative
</pre></code>

as per:
[<a href="https://developers.google.com/admob/ios/api/reference/Constants?hl=en-GB#/c:@kGADAdLoaderAdTypeUnifiedNative" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://developers.google.com/admob/ios/api/reference/Constants?hl=en-GB#/c:@kGADAdLoaderAdTypeUnifiedNative</a>](<a href="https://developers.google.com/admob/ios/api/reference/Constants?hl=en-GB#/c:@kGADAdLoaderAdTypeUnifiedNative)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://developers.google.com/admob/ios/api/reference/Constants?hl=en-GB#/c:@kGADAdLoaderAdTypeUnifiedNative)</a>

for reference, the documentation for native ads is at:
[<a href="https://developers.google.com/admob/ios/native/start" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://developers.google.com/admob/ios/native/start</a>](<a href="https://developers.google.com/admob/ios/native/start)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://developers.google.com/admob/ios/native/start)</a>

Background:
Admob now has 4 different ad unit types: banner, interstitial, rewarded and native advanced.

I recently attended an admob presentation from Google where they suggested that native advanced sees 30% better CPM's compared to banner so this is now a pretty crucial feature for ti.admob. 

When I test native advanced ads in the iOS simulator using ti.admob and Titanium with Google's test ad unit ID (ie. ca-app-pub-3940256099942544/3986624511 per: [<a href="https://developers.google.com/admob/ios/native/start?hl=en-GB" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://developers.google.com/admob/ios/native/start?hl=en-GB</a>](<a href="https://developers.google.com/admob/ios/native/start?hl=en-GB))" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://developers.google.com/admob/ios/native/start?hl=en-GB))</a>, the request always fails.

I have tried testing with multiple ad dimensions 
ie. 
100% width, 80dp height (smart banner)
300dp width, 250dp height (m-rec)
100% width, 140dp height (native banner)

however invariably, the response is:
"Request Error: No ad to show."

I have also tried setting up native advanced ad units in my admob account and testing with those admob account/unit id's however the same error occurs. I suspect this is because I am passing an adType of Admob.AD_TYPE_BANNER which seems to map to '0' when in fact I need to be passing a different argument there that maps to the UnifiedNative constant specified above.

For reference, here is an admob response from my titanium requests:

<code><pre>
[INFO]  Failed to receive banner ad: {"error":"Request Error: No ad to show.","adUnitId":"ca-app-pub-3940256099942544/3986624511","bubbles":true,"type":"didFailToReceiveAd","source":{"horizontalWrap":true,"visible":true,"touchEnabled":true,"top":"7dp","extras":{"version":"3.5.3","name":"StockLight"},"adBackgroundColor":"#fff","testDevices":["Simulator"],"requestAgent":"Appcelerator Titanium/7.5.0 (iPad/12.1; iOS; en_US;)","left":null,"adUnitId":"ca-app-pub-3940256099942544/3986624511","width":300,"contentURL":"<a href="https://stocklight.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://stocklight.com</a>","debugEnabled":false,"adType":0,"keywords":["stockmarket","stocks","investing","buffett","motley fool","acorns","asx","dividend","finance","investment","market"],"height":250,"tagForChildDirectedTreatment":false},"cancelBubble":false}
</pre></code>

I haven't tested admob's rewarded ads with ti.admob however I suspect they may also require introduction of a new ad type variable of Admob.AD_TYPE_REWARDED into the ti.admob module as well.
