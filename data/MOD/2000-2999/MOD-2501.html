<h3>Description</h3>

We are using Flurry analytics (Appcelerator Titanium) module in our project. The iOS analytics are captured correctly but for Android, most of the analytics are missing or not being captured. What could be the potential issue? I did write to the Flurry tech. support and also sent them a log which is attached. I got the following reply from Flurry tech. support:

1. You may need to reach out to Appcelerator, as the plugin is responsible for taking the code you log in the plugin and sending the data to us.

2. One of the things I noticed from the log is that all events are preceded by a session paused line, and followed by a session resumed line. Given this, it appears that the events are being logged outside of the session. I also do not see any "Session Sent" lines, which would indicate that a session was sent to Furry.

3. Going over the log does not reveal any issues other than possible that sessions are being called incorrectly, but this is handled by the plugin and the OS. For Android, the Flurry SDK relies on the activity lifecycle, once the SDK is initialized, session tracking relies on that lifecycle. Is there a member of the Appcelerator team who would know about how the plugin collects data from the SDK and passes it on?

   Hello,
   Thanks for reaching out! Please explain more about the issue you are experiencing. Would you please test  this [module](<a href="https://github.com/appcelerator-archive/ti.flurry/releases)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator-archive/ti.flurry/releases)</a> on SDK 8.0.0.GA and let us know the results. Also
   Do you have some test case to reproduce the issue on our end?
   
   </li>

   Hi Rakhi,
   
   Sure I will try the module with 8.0.0. The issue is that on Android all the log events are not being captured on the Flurry site while for iOS all event logs are captured. Why is that some events data missing for android? I have attached the android log for reference. There is no specific test case as such.</li>

   Hello, We need the sample project that is able to reproduce the issue on Android. Since it's working for the iOS. We need the same project for testing on the Android. I will forward this to our module team for farther investigation. Thanks.</li>

   The module works fine with sdk 8.0.0 for both iOS and Android. Thanks</li>
