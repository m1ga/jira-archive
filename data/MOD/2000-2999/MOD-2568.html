   Closed by accident. Still requires testing.</li>

   [~smohammed] verified that the module builds. I don't know if anyone has tested its functionality yet. If [~ssingh]'s team can actually test it with an NFC tags then that would be great.
   
   I can see that the PR was merged, but there is no "release" for it.</li>

   I just published a pre-release version for this ticket.
   <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator-modules/ti.nfc/releases/tag/android-4.0.0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator-modules/ti.nfc/releases/tag/android-4.0.0</a>
   
   [~ssingh], do you have anyone on your end that can test NFC? I don't have an NFC device to test with. Once the pre-release has been proven to work, we can update it to "release" status. Thanks!
   
   _*Edit:*_
   _I just tested it with a Nintendo Amiibo I have at home. The module works. :)
   [~ssingh], for your team's info, we document how to use the module in the link below. It provides working sample code._
