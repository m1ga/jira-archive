		"description": "Google has just published its official iOS 14 version of Admob version 7.64.0 that has support for AppTrackingTransparency included as well as support for SKAdNetwork which is extremely important also.\r\n\r\nIt seems they added AppTrackingTransparency directly into there framework with a way to call that function: https://developers.google.com/admob/ios/ios14\r\n\r\nAs well support with SKAdNetwork needs to be added with an idea of what the identifier should be in the info.plist \r\n\r\nThe current update that adds support for AppTrackingTransparency was done with an older version of the Admob SDK not the official one from Google with iOS 14 support.
