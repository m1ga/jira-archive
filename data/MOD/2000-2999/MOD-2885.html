In certain fit-band watches, it is observed that android-central gets auto disconnected after a certain period of time.

   It is observed that upon explicitly pairing the watch through the android Bluetooth settings screen, the auto disconnection does not occur.
   This observation is to be added into the BLE module README file.

   [~aajain] I verified by making android-central and iPhone-peripheral and followed the steps. Still, central-peripheral gets disconnected after around 50 secs.

   Closing as fix work of the fitness band. With iOS device, we have same issue with other 3rd party android app like Light blue. We need to investigate further what's the reason behind this but as scope of this defect it not a issue with native module.</li>
