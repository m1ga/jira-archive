<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>We need to support JS touch events as well as other capabilities
that are free with a web view. There are probably two options:</p>
<p>1) We need to make the existing web view support touch
events</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>2) We need to create a new type of view. For example, the
existing web view could become a HybridView or Composite View and
we could create a new web view that supports the appropriate JS
events/capabilities</p></div>

   <div><p>Fixed with 2341b09, although checking to see if events may
   interrupt flow with stopPropigation() would be good.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>Can you describe how to implement the fixed version? I compiled
   0.70 today and installed it, then selected 0.70 as the sdk for my
   app. I did a simple window.location.href change for an external web
   page from my app. The page loaded successfully, but still appears
   to be based on the scroll view. I cannot do any pinch zooming,
   which is what I was after. Is there a certain way I need to setup
   my window to support this?</p></div></li>

   <div><p>Looks like the problem may be with my build. It is failing to
   open several input files. Things like:</p>
   <p>/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/usr/bin/lipo:
   can't open input file: /Library/Application
   Support/Titanium/mobilesdk/osx/0.7.0/iphone/libTitanium-3.0.a (No
   such file or directory)</p>
   <p>Do I need to also update Titanium developer as well instead of
   just the mobile sdk?</p></div></li>
