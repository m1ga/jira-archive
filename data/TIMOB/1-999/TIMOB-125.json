		"description": "{html}<div><p>I've been tinkering around with TI to see if i could port a game\nI've been working on over from obj-c to TI. In the process i've\ndiscovered that the apps you can create with TI are severely\nlimited in layout options. I feel this is an issue that could prove\nfatal to the mass adoption of TI in general and hinder it's\ngrowth.</p>\n<p>The issue comes to light when you wish to create an app with a\ncustom designed layout, such as a layout with a fixed header and\nthen a fixed height / width tableview beneath it. Currently ti only\nlets you use a webview or tableview for your views and they both\ntake up the full real estate of the screen. There's no way to embed\na tableview with a fixed height inside a webview (i dont think this\nis possible with apples api)</p>\n<p>Why don't you use HTML to mimic a tableview you might ask? I\nthought of that and in my testing found that if you make a fixed\nheight div with overflow:auto the iphone webkit ignores it and\nsimply expands the height of the div to display all the content (no\nscrollbars sadly). While the same page loads fine with scrollbars\nin the regular safari.</p>\n<p>The lack of an embedable tableview makes apps / games such as\nthese examples impossible in Titanium's current form. If you go\nsearching for games on the appstore youll find that probably 60% or\nmore of the rpg ish games use this layout.</p>\n<p><a href=\n\"http://www.upchan.com/\">http://www.upchan.com/</a><em>img/large/6d6b5d6f8696c26a6625e45131c206d48b0c231e.jpg<br>\n<a href=\n\"http://www.upchan.com/\">http://www.upchan.com/</a></em>img/large/126aed1d15f44e92d0b55dfaf5b2f9c6873e8585.jpg</p>\n<p>A possible solution would be i think to make a new \"native\" view\ntype that you could embed both webviews and / or tableview inside\nof it. This would allow you to have the main view be native and you\ncould mix and match web views and table views to create the desired\ncustom layout. The obvious restriction of only being able to insert\nnative objects in the native would be likely be needed.</p>\n<p>While i'm on the subject. I would also love it if a ImageView\nobject would be accessible for TI users to create. UIImageView has\na built in animation system that is very very good and easy to use.\nI looked into doing something similar in jQuery frameworks and it's\nactually quite cumbersome. The only flipbook / slideshow custom\nanimation class i could find was at least a few hundred lines of\nbloated code. While all you do with a UIImageView is provide an\narray of image file names and specify duration and whether or not\nit should repeat.</p>\n<p>example:<br>\nNSArray <em>flameimages = [[NSArray alloc] initWithObjects:\n[UIImage imageNamed:@\"flame1.png\"], [UIImage\nimageNamed:@\"flame2.png\"], [UIImage imageNamed:@\"flame3.png\"],\n[UIImage imageNamed:@\"flame4.png\"], [UIImage\nimageNamed:@\"flame5.png\"], nil];<br>\nflame_left.animationImages = (NSArray</em> ) flameimages;<br>\nflame_left.animationDuration = .90;<br>\n[flame_left startAnimating];</p></div>{html}",

I went ahead and mocked up what might\nwork for the tiapp.xml formatting.</p>\n<p>Basically everything inside \"layouts\" will be looped over and\ninserted into the native view at the specified coordinates with the\nprovided widths and heights. Also note i put \"backgroundImage\" on\nthe window properties as well, not sure if this currently exists or\nnot but for my layouts i'd apply a background image to the entire\nview and then place my tableview in the correct position.</p>\n<p>Now the webview stuff for header and footer is a little iffy. I\nam not quite sure that would work because the webview itself would\noverlay ontop of the views background image. Was hoping we'd be\nable to use those for headers, but it seems like we might need\ndirect access to create UIImageViews and place them inside native\nviews instead.

Note that table, webby and webby2\ndid not have defined x nor width constraints, so that they take up\nthe entire width of the window. Similarly, Webby is given a height\nand y to pin it to the top, webby 2 is given a height but no y to\npin it to the bottom, and it serves to frame table to fill in the\nrest.\n<p>The advantage to allowing undefined constraints would be for the\npossibility of the layout automatically adjusting for any changes\nin orientation change (IE, were the device to rotate from portrait\nto landscape, webby, webby2, and table would be become wider,\nwebby2 would still hug the bottom, and the table would become\nshorter. However, this poses a problem with webby3. Hrm. Perhaps if\nthe option is given for portrait and landscape positioning? Perhaps\nlayering and webby3 would be dropped until this is figured out)</p>\n<p>Autopositioning algorithm aside, much of the native structure is\nalready there due to a detail of the flip and curl transitions.</p></div>{html}",

Web views each have\ntheir own individual background colors behind them correct since\nits essentially a web page in each one.
