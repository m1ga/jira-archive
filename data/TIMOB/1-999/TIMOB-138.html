<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>I came across something else i use in my obj-c apps that I cant
seem to find any documentation about doing with titanium. Input
fields inside an alert. I use it for a account register dialog
(much easier and imo smoother progression).</p>
<p>here an example of how its done in objective c</p>
<pre>
<code class=
"objc">UIAlertView *alert = [[UIAlertView alloc] initWithTitle: @"Register Account" message: @"" delegate: self cancelButtonTitle: @"Nevermind" otherButtonTitles: @"Register!", nil];
[alert addTextFieldWithValue: @"" label: @"Email"];
[alert addTextFieldWithValue: @"" label: @"Password"];
[alert addTextFieldWithValue: @"" label: @"Password Confirm"];

emailField = [alert textFieldAtIndex:0];
emailField.keyboardType = UIKeyboardTypeAlphabet;
emailField.keyboardAppearance = UIKeyboardAppearanceAlert;
emailField.autocorrectionType = UITextAutocorrectionTypeNo;
emailField.autocapitalizationType = UITextAutocapitalizationTypeNone;
    
passwordField = [alert textFieldAtIndex:1];
passwordField.clearButtonMode = UITextFieldViewModeWhileEditing;
passwordField.keyboardType = UIKeyboardTypeNumbersAndPunctuation;
passwordField.keyboardAppearance = UIKeyboardAppearanceAlert;
passwordField.autocorrectionType = UITextAutocorrectionTypeNo;
passwordField.secureTextEntry = YES;

passwordField2 = [alert textFieldAtIndex:2];
passwordField2.clearButtonMode = UITextFieldViewModeWhileEditing;
passwordField2.keyboardType = UIKeyboardTypeNumbersAndPunctuation;
passwordField2.keyboardAppearance = UIKeyboardAppearanceAlert;
passwordField2.autocorrectionType = UITextAutocorrectionTypeNo;
passwordField2.secureTextEntry = YES;

[alert show];
[alert release];</code>
</pre>
<p>any chance we might see this in the future as well?</p></div>

   <div><p>Part of the problem is that the -[UIAlertView
   addTextFieldWithValue:label:] and -[UIAlert textFieldAtIndex:] are
   currently undocumented/private APIs, and the use of it could result
   in App Store rejections. There's another trick that's just as hairy
   which involves blindly stabbing UITextFields into the view that is
   UIAlertView.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>That's unfortunate. I've seen apps on the appstore that employ
   this method, but you know how crappy apples policies are... they
   could get pulled tomorrow, or never. :(</p></div></li>

   <div><p>Tell me about it. My 'favorite' is when you release 2.0, which
   has x new feature and gets approved, then you do an important
   bugfix to 2.0.1, and it's rejected for the x which was in 2.0.
   Given the trouble Apple gave PhoneGap early on, Titanium was
   designed to stay as safely inside the lines as possible.</p>
   <p>The Apple guidelines themselves say, 'don't put text fields in
   alerts, use modal fullscreen pages for it'. The fact that Apple
   themselves do it (Safari and app store) and have such a nice
   interface for it makes this even more annoying.</p>
   <p>In the mean time, the solution is to create a window with a web
   view with the text fields and buttons, and have
   window.open({modal:true}) so the window is brought up from the
   bottom. It's not as pretty, but it's kosher and it's here now.</p>
   <p>--Edit: My bad. I can't recall, but I think the {modal:true}
   functionality is coming out in 0.7.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>No longer holding breath for Apple to share their toys with
   others. Until they do, we might as well close this one. Since it
   was never resolved, it'll have to be marked invalid.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>This is really something I been wishing for a long long time.
   Any way someone can make this thing as a module so its optional? I
   want to test it with an app and see if it gets rejected!</p></div></li>
