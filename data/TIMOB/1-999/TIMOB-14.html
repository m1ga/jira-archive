   <div><p>It's certainly possible. By Url handlers, I assume you mean,
   "Launch my app when someone tries to go to foo://bar...". One half
   would be adding an entry to tiapp.xml, an array of schemes that the
   app can handle.</p>
   <p>The other half would be some way to relay to the Javascript the
   custom url that launched the app. There's a number of ways it could
   be done, but probably the most sensible way would to be to expose
   it as if the app was launched with the url as a command line
   argument.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>bq. as if the app was launched with the url as a command line
   argument</p>
   <p>I love it.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>Currently it is possible to define a Custom URL editing the
   info.plist file and adding the proper fields.</p>
   <p>But one thing even more interesting related to Custom URLs would
   be to be able to retrieve data that you pass to the app with Query
   Strings. LIke this:</p>
   <p>open Safari and fire my App Custom URL: myapp://?foo="bar"</p>
   <p>Current, there is no way to retrieve this variable foo from the
   browser in the App.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>you can already do this. take a look at the Info.plist for
   Kitchen Sink project.</p>
   <p>You can also retrieve the values from the
   Titanium.App.getArguments() method call. Returns a dictionary of
   the values the app was launched with.</p></div></li>
