<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>need to add support for application properties which are loaded
into the application at compile time but are outside the source
code (both to be configurable and more secure). properties should
be compiled in and made available via
Titanium.App.Properties.getString. file format is java properties
(key=value). file will automatically be picked up during compile if
located in project.dir/appdata.cfg.</p></div>
