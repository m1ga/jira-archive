   <div><p>I've tracked this down (on Window's XP) to a failure in javac
   being run. If I change run(['javac','-version']) to
   run(['cmd.exe','/C','javac','-version']) in android/prereq.py javac
   is correctly detected if the jdk is on the path.</p>
   <p>If you run prereq.py from the command line, it correctly detects
   java as well.</p>
   <p>Looking at the python docs <a href=
   "<a href="http://www.python.org/doc/2.5.2/lib/node528.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.python.org/doc/2.5.2/lib/node528.html</a>">POpen</a> in 2.5
   uses CreateProcess under the covers.</p>
   <p>On Windows: the Popen class uses CreateProcess() to execute the
   child program, which operates on strings. If args is a sequence, it
   will be converted to a string using the list2cmdline method. Please
   note that not all MS Windows applications interpret the command
   line the same way: list2cmdline is designed for applications using
   the same rules as the MS C runtime.</p>
   <p>From <a href=
   "<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms682425%28VS.85" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms682425%28VS.85</a>">MSDN</a>.aspx)</p>
   <p>The string can specify the full path and file name of the module
   to execute or it can specify a partial name. In the case of a
   partial name, the function uses the current drive and current
   directory to complete the specification. <strong>The function will
   not use the search path.</strong> This parameter must include the
   file name extension; no default extension is assumed.</p></div></li>

   <p>I am running on vista and getting this error as well.<br>
   I tried to make the change you specified but no dice.</p>
   <p>Do I downloaded java but is there something I am missing?</p></div></li>
<li>Don Thorp 2011-04-15

   <div><p>I will be working on the fix and testing XP, Vista, and Windows
   7. If it is easily patchable, I'll update instructions.</p></div></li>
<li>richards.justin (at gmail) 2011-04-15

   <div><p>Sounds Great.<br>
   This error has me stopped in my tracks.</p>
   <p>Thanks Don.</p></div></li>
<li>Don Thorp 2011-04-15

   <div><p>I've attached a replacement prereq.py that should work on
   0.4.2.</p>
   <ul>
   <li>Stop Titanium Developer</li>
   <li>Backup C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application
   Data\Titanium\mobilesdk\win32\0.4.2\android</li>
   <li>Copy the attached prereq.py over the existing one.</li>
   <li>Start Titanium Developer</li>
   <li>Create a new Mobile project to have it re-detect</li>
   </ul>
   <p>If you still have an issue, then you might need to follow the
   clean up steps in <a href=

   <div><p>Don,</p>
   <p>I am running windows xp. Which sqlite db do I need to clear? I
   am assuming it is for the Titanium Developer but I cannot seem to
   find where this is on windows.</p></div></li>

    <p>I upgraded to 0.5.0 and still get this error on Titanium
    Developer running on XP when I launch the android emulator.</p>

    <div><p>Troy,</p>
    <p>If you don't mind let's try removing Titanium from XP and
    starting with a fresh install.</p>
    <p>delete C:\Program Files\Titanium Developer<br>
    delete "C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application
    Data\Titanium"<br>
    delete C:\Documents and Settings__YOURUSERNAME__.titanium</p>
    <p><strong>If you don't have any Titanium based apps with data
    then</strong><br>
    delete C:\Documents and Settings__YOURUSERNAME__\Application
    Data\Titanium</p>
    <p>_Ok some other test steps_</p>
    <p>From the command line make sure you can successfully run<br>
    <strong>javac -version</strong></p>
    <p>You should have java 1.5.X or 1.6.X</p>
    <p>echo %JAVA_HOME%</p>
    <p>You should see the full path to the <strong>JDK</strong>
    directory, not the <strong>JRE</strong> directory. If you don't,
    set it in your environment.</p>
    <p>Then try installing developer again.</p></div></li>

    <div><p>Hi,</p>
    <p>I tried removing Titanium, and re-installing. Trace log as
    follows:</p>

    <p>Thank you for any other suggestions. Have not been able to get
    Titanium emulators working yet.</p></div></li>
<li>Don Thorp 2011-04-15

    <div><p>Jason S,</p>
    <p>It looks like it is unable to locate the Android SDK. Were you
    prompted for<br>
    the SDK's location when you created your application?</p></div></li>
<li>Troy Borja 2011-04-15

    <div><p>Hello Don,</p>
    <p>I removed Titanium and re-installed using the instructions for
    developing in Windows outlined in the CodeStrong documentation. Now
    the android emulator starts and the test mobile default application
    is already working. I think the problem had to do with setting the
    correct environment variables. In XP JAVA_HOME was not
    automatically set so I had to put it in manually. Thank you for
    your time.</p></div></li>

    <div><p>Not sure why this has been so difficult for someone to get you a
    proper response... I don't know anything about Python, and I have
    no idea what this script is written to run in, but I found the
    problem and while not a solution, I found a "resolution" if you
    will.</p>
    <p>if you can type javac -version and get 1.6.xxxxx then you don't
    need this script telling you there is a problem. what is wrong is
    the script is looking for "1.6" no more, no less. if javac -version
    reports back 1.6.0_21 (which is current JDK as of a couple of weeks
    ago, although JRE is at 1.6.0_24) then prereq.py will report it as
    an invalid version. edit the file, somewhere around line 17 you
    will see "1.6" in the file, change that to match what your javac
    -version reports back to you and you should be good. Well, at least
    until you update your JDK version... :P</p>
    <p>if you need more help, I have written a blog post about it that,
    while a bit more confusing, shows you how to change this so it
    works, step by step, on linux, using VI as the editor.</p>

    <p>hope this helps some, also if this is the resolution used to
    create the prereq.py file posted above, it might not be working for
    people, because their JDK is a newer version...</p></div></li>
