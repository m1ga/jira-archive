   <div><p>this didn't end up making 0.7 but should be target for 0.8
   IMO</p></div></li>
<li>mentalengine 2011-04-15

   <div><p>Does this look like it will be resolved with the impending 0.8
   release?</p></div></li>

   <div><p>Sorry, it didn't make it into 0.8. The AVAudioPlayer class
   Titanium uses for playing sound on the iPhone doesn't handle
   streaming or any non-local files. To do streaming, I'll be delving
   into Audio Queue Services, which is much more low-level, and switch
   between the two methods depending on the url.</p>
   <p>I do believe in 0.8, however, if it is not a stream, you could
   use HTTPClient to download the data, then save it as a file, and
   play the file passing the file.url in. Titanium would translate the
   url into a filepath for AVAudioPlayer.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>This was fixed a while back, with even a streamed url in Kitchen
   Sink nowadays.</p></div></li>
