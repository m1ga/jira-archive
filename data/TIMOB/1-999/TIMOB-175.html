<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>Currently composite views don't render as a uniform UI, they
render sequentially. We need them to render all at once if
possible</p></div>

   <div><p>It is possible to make the composite view wait until
   everything's loaded, but it does mean that if a web view takes a
   long time to complete, the user is faced with a blank view for a
   long time, and that rendering the view will be perceived as slow.
   There might be other times where it's desirable to have the
   fast-loading views not wait for the web view.</p>
   <p>On one hand, having pages load at different speeds is jarring.
   On the other, imageViews and tableViews blocked by a webView might
   also be bad, especially if it has an external dependency.</p>
   <p>One possible solution is that all views have a 'hidden' property
   with show and hide methods. By displaying the composite view
   already hidden, and having the currentWindow 'loaded' event call
   the composite view show method, the same effect could be had.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>Moot as composite views went away in 0.9.</p></div></li>
