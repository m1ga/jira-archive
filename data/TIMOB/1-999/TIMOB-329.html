<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>from community issue:</p>
<p>I'm also pretty sure someone needs to look at MediaModule.m more
too, for the fact that if I use the camera to take a picture for
upload and have allowImageEditing to FALSE in my app, it seems to
ignore the orientation a had the camera.<br></p>
<p>I was looking around this part of the code to see if there was
any way where the actual size of a cropped image could be set.
Currently the 'image editor' square when it crops a photos seems to
create a VERY small photo - 319x320 pixels - can the cropRect part
be adjusted to make the inal cropped image larger?</p>
<p>I also note that when NOT using image editing on a photo,
uploading seems to take forever on a 'full' sized image taken.</p>
<p>If we could have some more control over this - QUALITY_SMALL,
MEDIUM, LARGE etc. possibly, that would be great.</p>
<p>I also note that for video recording, the videoMaximumDuration
and quality settings seem make no difference.</p></div>
