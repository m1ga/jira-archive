<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>Being able to refer to map annotations only by their title
attribute becomes major issue as soon as one or more share a common
title. The only option at present to somehow make each title
unique, which means you are forced to display an identifier to the
user regardless of whether it's meaningful to them or not.</p>
<p>methods with arguments like
<code>mapViewInstance.removeAnnotation(myAttribute,aValue){&#8230;}</code>,
and also passing these attributes to annotation events, would give
you total control over annotations regardless of what information
you wanted to display to the user.</p></div>
