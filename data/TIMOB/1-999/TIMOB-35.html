<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>In certain cases developers may need to pre-load application
tabs, for example if they'd like to display a badge right away.</p>
<p>Currently with the kitchen_sink demo, the badge on the "UI" tab
is only displayed after the user clicks on it, which is not the
expected behavior.</p>
<p>I propose supporting a new XMl element called within in
tiapp.xml. If set to true, the window's html would be loaded as
soon as the tab was created.</p></div>

   <div><p>Mooted by the new codebase.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>Meaning that the new codebase already does this? Which Titanium
   version do you mean with this? :-)</p></div></li>

   <div><p>Version 0.8.X and earlier (Mar 2009-Dec 2009) used a different
   design where tabs were specified in the tiapp.xml, and used HTML
   pages for logic--the HTML was loaded only on the tab's first focus.
   0.9.X and later (Jan 2010 to current) use JS files that run as soon
   as they're opened. Tabs are specified at runtime. There's nothing
   to preload.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>Ah. But what about the slight delay in showing a tableview when
   opening a tab?<br>
   Perhaps an option to preload tableviews is a good idea?</p></div></li>
