<div><p>Google have open source libraries to do this (QR Codes), would
be nice to see this accessible in Titanium</p></div>

   <div><p>i have a working prototype around this using QR codes. I'll
   bring this in just as soon as 1.0 is out.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>Hi jhaynie, i'm trying to make zxwing work on my project. If I
   have correctly understood, you already did it. So, can you help me
   please?<br>
   I'm able to access the camera and get the picture, and i've
   included zxwing library on my project. I just need a couple of code
   lines to<br>
   understand how to call the object-c function that decodes images.
   Thanks a lot, Flavio</p></div></li>
<li>Jeff Haynie 2011-04-15

   <div><p>if you can send me your sample project, maybe we can
   collaborate?</p>
   <p>are you willing to contribute your work to titanium as open
   source?</p></div></li>

   <div><p>Hi jhaynie, of course I'm willing to contribute my work as open
   source!<br>
   I was able to make zxwing work in a native obkect c project... I
   modified the source<br>
   and added a "take a picture" button. After that, the app decodes
   the qr code and give<br>
   me the result. Now I would like to paste it in a titanium
   project... I get no error<br>
   at compile time after insert the library on modules folder, but I
   can't figure out how<br>
   to call the function from javascript... I'm on it in this moment,
   if I get some<br>
   result i'll post you. Thanks a lot, Flavio</p></div></li>

   <div><p>i haven't had a chance to create a better sample project - i
   will do that<br>
   before monday with the new documentation that will launch on
   monday. It's<br>
   rather easy. To call from JS - you just need to define a function
   in<br>
   objective-c module like this:</p>
   <p>-(id)functionName:(id)args { return resultObject; }</p>
   <p>This would map to JS:</p>
   <p>var result = Ti.ModuleName.functionName(args);</p>
   <p>To invoke a property accessor in JS:</p>
   <p>-(id)propertyName { return result; }</p>
   <p>To invoke a property setter in JS:</p>
   <p>-(void)propertyName:(id)value {</p>
   <p>}</p>
   <p>Titanium generally will do the rest. If you need to fire events,
   the sample<br>
   module project created when you create a module will show you an
   example.</p>
   <p>If you'd like, you can share your project with me and I can wire
   it up for<br>
   you and send it back to you.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>Thank you jhaynie. I believe that my problem is to pass an image
   as parameter. I take a picture from camera and I want to use it as
   parameter for an object-c function (I've already make a module and
   titanium seems to compile it). I made a project in object-c that
   takes a shoot and decodes the qr code and it works. Now I'm tryng
   to call the function from titanium but my app freezes and gives me
   an error. In Xcode I do something like this:</p>
   <p>[self.decoder decodeImage:image cropRect:cropRect];</p>
   <p>If you give me your email address I will send you my working
   xcode project (I'm a web programmer, my obcject-c sucks :-D )<br>
   Thanks a lot, Flavio</p></div></li>

   <div><p>jhaynie, did you get a chance to include your sample project in
   the documentation for 1.0?</p>
   <p>Regards,</p>

   <div><p>I'm working on porting the doc and they should be done and
   published before<br>
   monday.</p></div></li>
<li>flaz83 2011-04-15

   <div><p>Hi jhaynie! Any news on porting?<br>
   Thanks a lot, Flavio</p></div></li>
<li>mutasim 2011-04-15

    <div><p>Any updates matey?</p></div></li>

    <div><p>The module sdk docs are updated here:</p>

    <div><p>Hi,</p>
    <p>I am very curious if one of you ever got it working... (Since
    the last message on this already came from april). I am working on
    a similar project, A native qr-code reader in a mobile titanium
    application.</p>
    <p>Do you guys know if anyone succeeded in realising this? I am not
    a programmer ( i am exacly a visual designer) so it's hard for me
    just to start somewhere. I am able to make a program in titanium,
    but i don't know really how to embedd a qr-reader/decoder in it
    which you can use the phone camera to "read" the code and a part of
    the application to decode it.</p>
    <p>If anyone can help me any further with this, or wants to share
    his knowledge of this it really would help me a lot.</p></div></li>

    <div><p>Hi, I'm working on it since February.<br>
    I'm not able yet to get zxing to work... but right now I just fix
    the barcode decoding problem by using this: <a href=
    "<a href="http://zxing.org/w/decode.jspx" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://zxing.org/w/decode.jspx</a>"><a href="http://zxing.org/w/decode.jspx" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://zxing.org/w/decode.jspx</a></a>.<br>
    You take a picture with the camera, resize it and then upload it to
    that website... You will get the decoded string...<br>
    It's not an optimal solution, but jhaynie told us he is working on
    "marketplace app" wich will include some kind of api to decode
    barcodes.<br>
    Hope to be helpful,<br>
    Flavio</p></div></li>
<li>Jeff Haynie 2011-04-15

    <div><p>I have completed the initial version of this module for the
    upcoming marketplace.</p>
    <p>I can provide a preview of the module to anyone that would like
    to test it ahead of its official release.<br></p>
    <p>If interested, please send me email at <a href=
    "mailto:jhaynie@appcelerator.com">jhaynie@appcelerator.com</a> and
    reference the Barcode reader module.</p></div></li>
<li>Jeff Haynie 2011-04-15

    <div><p>this will not be in titanium itself but in the upcoming Module
    Marketplace to launch very soon. please stay tuned to developer
    blog.</p></div></li>
<li>JHill 2011-04-15

    <div><p>Awesome. My prototype that I need to complete for angel funding
    in 2 weeks just got moved from "any day now" to "soon". I have an
    Android module using zxing, but the "Titanium Module SDK for
    iPhone/iPad" fails all over the place with the latest xcode. If a
    module for iPhone exists today, let's talk $$$ please!!</p></div></li>
<li>Jeff Haynie 2011-04-15

    <div><p>@JHill - email me and i can provide more details.</p></div></li>
