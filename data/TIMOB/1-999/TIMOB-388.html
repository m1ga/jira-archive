<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>The appcelerator.com site doesn't give any indication of exactly
what one receives when clicking the "DOWNLOAD TITANIUM" link. The
result page also has no version or file info. The dmg file has no
version info in its filename, and upon mounting and opening,
there's no readme file or other way I could see to determine
exactly what I'd downloaded. The only option seems to be to install
the program.</p>
<p>Somewhere (preferably before starting the download) this info
should be displayed.</p>
<p>My use case: When I start Titanium Developer, I see a message
about version numbers at the top of the window. (screenshot) I
don't quite understand if it's correct, and want to verify if I
have the latest version installed. Due to the lack of displayed
version info, I'm unable to.</p></div>

   <div><p>A related issue: The dmg download file apparently has a custom
   icon set; the same icon as used for the application itself. This is
   confusing. Please either revert to the default icon, or change the
   custom icon to follow the OS X standard of resembling a removable
   drive.</p></div></li>
