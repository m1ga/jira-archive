<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>Base UI =&gt; Views =&gt; Scroll Views =&gt; Scrollable View
(scroll_views_scrollable.js)</p>
<p>Using the Jump or Change buttons repeated causes UI state to get
jacked - screen goes black. The view does still seem to have the
proper model (i.e., after scrolling, things go back into place)</p></div>

   <div><p>Scrollable appears to be working now. There might be a few
   glitches still related to scrollable, but they are no longer going
   to black and would warrant as a different bug.</p></div></li>
