   <div><p>i've improved upon this.</p>
   <p>note, to test the battery state change events, you'll have to
   test a little differently. the battery state/level on changes at 5%
   increments. i was able to trigger by doing this...</p>
   <p>open up the platform tab and the platform test and leave that
   screen open. go to the remote video test and let it play for a
   little bit (you may have to play a couple of times). this should
   drain the battery. you should eventually see an alert with
   notification of battery change.</p></div></li>
