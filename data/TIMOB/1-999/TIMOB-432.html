<h3>Description</h3>

of value for Titanium Mobile. Opens the consumption of 3rd party
services like linkedin, twitter (already done, but is restrictive),
etc.</p></div>

   <div><p>Hey Nicolas -</p>
   <p>We have had great success with the Netflix Javascript OAuth
   libraries. I had to tweak a few minor things to get it working in
   Titanium, but nothing major at all.</p>
   <p>Check it out at <a href=
   "<a href="http://oauth.googlecode.com/svn/code/javascript/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://oauth.googlecode.com/svn/code/javascript/</a>"><a href="http://oauth.googlecode.com/svn/code/javascript/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://oauth.googlecode.com/svn/code/javascript/</a></a></p>
   <p>Hope this helps.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>Awesome. Thank you very much!.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>I think it's better to implement OAuth native.</p></div></li>
<li>Stephen Tramer 2011-04-15

   <div><p>Possibly a candidate for modularization.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>Hey Stephen,<br>
   If there is any more advanced guides/tech pages on writing modules
   for Android/iphone I am more than happy to take this on. I did the
   iphone calendar widget, but I think I made a bit of pigs ear with
   the whole proxy vs viewproxy vs view etc. If you want to take this
   'offline' my email is my firstname @ ummon :)</p>
   <p>I also tried to submit Gh fixes for the iphone dashboard layout
   not accepting anything other than 3x3 but.. they were rejected
   without comment :( :(</p></div></li>

   <div><p>Stephen Tramer, this should be a higher priority for Titanium
   Developer. Nicolas is right, this would be a huge advance and
   significant added value.</p>
   <p>There currently is no publicly available solution for Twitter on
   Android, @ziodave's solution is compatible only with iOS.</p></div></li>

   This is a very old ticket, but we do have a commonjs module for auth that users could try here: <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator-modules/ti.oauth" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator-modules/ti.oauth</a></li>
<li>Christopher Williams 2017-07-20

   I don't believe we ever plan to implement OAuth in the core of the SDK, but hope users will find the ti.oauth implementation worthwhile as a means for doing oauth.</li>
