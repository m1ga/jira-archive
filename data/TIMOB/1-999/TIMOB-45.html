<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>My tiapp.xml file contains about 7 windows. All have the
backgroundColor set to <a href="/projects/32238/tickets/000" title=
"Ticket #000">#000</a>.<br>
Titanium Mobile automaticly create the "more" tab for pages 5,6 and
7.<br>
When I switch to the "more" tab the NavBar has the default
color.<br>
It would be nice if it takes <a href="/projects/32238/tickets/000"
title="Ticket #000">#000</a> as backgroundColor, too.</p></div>

   <div><p>Blain, can you look at this in the next milestone?</p></div></li>

   <div><p>Clarifying here: I'm assuming you mean the barColor (the
   color/tint/style of the nav bar) instead of backgroundColor (The
   color of the content area where the actual extra tabs are
   listed).</p>
   <p>It looks like it's certainly doable, although this raises the
   question of where to specify it in the TiApp.xml. I'm also
   thinking, since repeating the same properties over and over is
   tiresome, it might be good to be able to specify properties that
   are treated as the default for app windows, the more tab
   included.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>The barColor is what I mean.<br>
   I think, application-wide properties would be very usefull.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>Okay, possible proposal for feature functionality:</p>
   <p>in tiapp.plist (And by extension, tiapp.xml) an optional entry
   of 'template' is a dictionary-type object that represents an
   abstract titanium window.</p>
   <p>Possible properties that can be inherited from the template may
   include 'barColor', 'background', 'backgroundImage', 'orientation',
   'barImage', 'landscapeBackgroundImage', 'statusBarStyle',
   'fullscreen', 'hideNavBar', and 'hideTabBar'.</p>
   <p>Some of these could apply to a custom
   moreNavigationController.</p></div></li>
<li>Blain Hamon 2011-04-15

   <div><p>Followup of possible pitfall or very subtle difference.</p>
   <p>A barColor can be one of three possible states: Null, a color,
   or 'transparent'. If Null, the standard blueish color is used
   (Nontinted).</p>
   <p>Given a template that specifies a black barColor, there is a
   subtle yet important difference between specifying a window having
   a null barColor and a window having an undefined barColor. The
   former is to use the blue. The latter is to inherit the black from
   the template. This might trip people up.</p>
   <p>Given that android doesn't have a difference between null and
   undefined, this might be trouble in the future (Not with barColor
   given that it's iPhone-only, but in general)</p></div></li>
<li>Blain Hamon 2011-04-15

   <div><p>barColor is a property of the tab group to allow this to work.
   Clearing out old fixed bugs.</p></div></li>
