   <div><p>Okay, after looking at the source, there is some justification
   of the logic. That is, when a tab is closed, it closes its windows,
   losing the state of the stack. Closing is destructive. When the tab
   group is closed, similarly it removes the tabs its had so they they
   can close recursively. So that closing the tab group is
   destructive.</p>
   <p>For the purposes of the test, it appears that the test should
   save the tabs, close, and when opening, move the tabs back in,
   since nondestructively closing a tabgroup should be a rare
   case.</p>
   <p>In the event that closing a tab group should be nondestructive,
   the tabs themselves may not get a close event until the tab group
   is dealloced. There may be a retain loop that prevents the dealloc
   from happening.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>fwiw this is a 3.1.2 issue, iOS4.0 does not show this issue</p></div></li>

   <div><p>I have run into this issue also. I have tested it using latest
   builds of both 1.4.X and 1.5 master dated 6th Nov 2010, via the
   android emulator on ubuntu.</p>
   <p>Note these other tickets describe very similar issues, and could
   possibly be closed and summarised here instead:<br>

   <p>To summarise the current status from a user/dev perspective,
   when the tabgroup is closed, a blank, black, screen is displayed.
   There is no way to return the UI to the user from this point
   onwards.</p>
   <p>To test different scenarios, just comment/uncomment and re-order
   the commands in the click event of the button in <a href=
   "<a href="https://gist.github.com/671413" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://gist.github.com/671413</a>">this code</a>.</p>
   <p>Note this certainly affects android. Does it also affect
   iOS?</p></div></li>

   <div><p>Just to add, this is the current tabgroup behaviour when opening
   a new window that is not attached to a tab:</p>
   <p>As stated, if a tabgroup is closed you will just see a black
   blank screen, and you cannot recover from it.</p>
   <p>If you create and open a window, then the new window will appear
   inside the active tab, with the tabgroup navigation showing
   above.</p>
   <p>If you set the navBarHidden: true property on that window and
   then open it, it will fill the whole screen (covering the
   tabs).</p></div></li>
<li>Blain Hamon 2011-04-15

   <div><p>We might want to circle around and look at the behavior. On most
   windows, once they're closed, they're closed. If they're
   reopenable, retention cycles may cause havoc with memory.</p></div></li>
<li>hal 2011-04-15

   <div><p>Please note that my comments in this ticket related to android,
   whereas I think most post refer to iOS. Please bear this in mind
   when reading my posts.</p>
   <p>From what I understand, tabGroups behave differently natively on
   the two platforms (ie android doesn't not have a native way of
   removing a tab), so it is not surprising that there isn't
   consistent behavior at the Titanium level.</p></div></li>
