<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>We need to support a simple top-down layout for our native
containers (windows, views, etc.)</p>
<p>This involves two major changes:</p>
<p>1) containers must support a layout property. We will initially
only support a block layout (i.e., items added to a container will
be stacked based on their explicit height or calculated height (for
height:'auto')</p>
<p>2) views (all views) must support margin, marginTop, marginLeft,
marginBottom, marginRight and padding, paddingTop, paddingLeft,
paddingBottom, and paddingRight</p></div>

   <div><p>Reviewed your doc and talked it over with Jeff. The reality is
   that 90% of the cases only require vertical layout, so let's start
   simple.</p>
   <p>On the parent view let's add the ability to support a layout
   property. For now, this property will support two values: absolute
   and vertical. Absolute is the default.</p>
   <p>By default views will be added directly below the previously
   added view (i.e., no space between the views). Sub views can use
   their top, left, right and bottom properties to effectively specify
   relative positioning (acts like margin). So if the second sub view
   added specifies a top:10, we would place that view 10 pixels below
   the view above it.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>Verifying behavior: MarginFoo is the same as foo in absolute
   layout? (IE, it's the space outside the view owning the property.
   Padding would be the space inside the view?</p></div></li>

   <p>Do I understand correctly that relative positioning is currently
   only available for windows, meaning that only their direct children
   flow vertically?</p>
   <p>Is there any plan to facilitate multiple views being relatively
   positioned within a container view and, if so, do you have any idea
   how long until it is released?</p>
   <p>This functionality, along with percentages used for width,
   height, left, right, top, bottom etc, will vastly simplify screen
   building for different sized target device. Note that percentages
   currently do not work - are you also aware of this?</p>
   <p>Thank you very much<br>
   Hal</p></div></li>
