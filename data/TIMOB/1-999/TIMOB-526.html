<p>var cleanstory = 'St Kilda has sacked recruit Andrew Lovett just
a day after the former Essendon forward was charged with rape but
insists it was not because of the criminal charge he faces.\n\nThe
Saints confirmed on Tuesday afternoon that they intend to
'terminate Lovett's employment' with the club immediately, less
than three months after giving up their first pick in the national
draft in ';<br>
cleanstory = cleanstory + 'order to secure the troubled
star.\n\nLovett fell foul of club officials within weeks of joining
the club when he was arrested for being drunk in a public place but
after being fined following that incident he found himself in much
more trouble in December.\n\nAfter drinking with a team-mate at a
Richmond hotel late in December Lovett was accused of raping a
sleeping woman at ';<br>
cleanstory = cleanstory + 'a Port Melbourne apartment, with the
club reacting to the allegations by immediately suspending him
indefinitely.\n\nAnd while police charges were not laid until
Monday the club has announced that it has made the decision to
dismiss Lovett but claims the decision is 'not based on whether or
not Andrew Lovett is innocent or guilty', that it was 'not part of
the club's decision-making process'.\n\n"During ';<br>
cleanstory = cleanstory + 'Andrew's short tenure with the club, on
a number of occasions he engaged in actions that were failures to
comply with our standards of expected behavioral conduct," said
chief executive Michael Nettlefold.\n\n"These failures related to
his training commitments and a failure to contact club officials in
a situation where he should have done so. "\n\n"We simply could not
ignore such breaches. Nor could we ignore ';<br>
cleanstory = cleanstory + 'the damage being done to St Kilda's
reputation and decided unanimously as a club to terminate Andrew
Lovett's employment with the Saints."\n\nWhile St Kilda refused to
discuss the case against Lovett as it does not want to prejudice
him, the AFL Players' Association was 'extremely disappointed' with
the Saints' decision.\n\n"The AFL and AFLPA have agreed to a
grievance resolution procedure which seeks ';<br>
cleanstory = cleanstory + 'to resolve disputes between players and
Clubs in good faith," AFLPA CEO Matthew Finnis said.\n\n"We expect
that clubs and players will respect this procedure and use their
best endeavours to resolve issues between them via this
system."\n\n"St Kilda's decision is, in our view, inconsistent with
this principle and has the potential to undermine the commitment of
players to the established codes and procedures for ';<br>
cleanstory = cleanstory + 'dealing with disciplinary matters and
disputes within the AFL industry."\n\n"AFL players are employees,
and AFL clubs are workplaces. Notwithstanding the nature of their
work or their profiles, AFL players ought be able to rely upon
basic principles of fairness and due process before being subjected
to disciplinary action."\n\n"We have serious concerns as to whether
Andrew's legal rights have been respected and will';<br>
cleanstory = cleanstory + 'further consult with his legal
representatives to address this concern in coming days."\n\nHaving
reportedly signed a three-year, $1 million contract when he was
drafted, Lovett may launch legal action against St Kilda, which
refused to say whether he will have his contract paid
out.\n\nLovett was seeking mediation to try and have the decision
to ban him from the club overturned but with mediation no longer a
possibility it appears almost certain that he will take the Saints
to court.\n\nMeanwhile, AFL General Manager of Football Operations
Adrian Anderson indicated in a statement on Tuesday that they would
be leaving the matter in the hands of the club in
question.\n\n"This is a contractual matter between St Kilda and
Andrew Lovett. The AFL respects the right of St Kilda to make this
decision and we do not intend to interfere in the matter," Anderson
said.\n\nSt Kilda coach Ross Lyon admitted that the decision to
give up pick 16 at last year's draft for Lovett had backfired and
that he is now looking forward to Friday's NAB Cup clash with
Collingwood at Etihad Stadium.\n\n"We went through what we believed
to be due diligence or research and referencing and at the end of
that made a reasonable or unanimous decision," Lyon said.\n\n"It's
easy to sit here in hindsight (and say we should not have traded
for him) but I'm certainly not saying it's been a positive
outcome."\n\n"As a coach and a team what we need is to focus on our
actions and prepare and the AFL season continues but we're one
short."\n\n"But it's undeniably a negative start (to the season).
It's not something we could've foreseen."\n\n"You try and prepare
for challenges thrown up, this is one that's been put in front of
us and that we'll deal with. (But) we're mentally
strong."\n\nLovett, who booted 93 goals in 88 games with the
Bombers after making his debut in 2005, was released by the club at
the end of the 2009 season after a troubled five years at Windy
Hill.\n\nA gifted player on the field, having won the Anzac Day
medal as best afield in just his third game in the traditional
battle against Collingwood in Round 5 of his debut season, Lovett
found himself in trouble several times of it during his time with
Essendon.\n\nThe most serious issue related an incident with a
former girlfriend in which he was accused of beating her and
refusing to let her out of his car as he kept her hostage driving
around Melbourne for 45 minutes.\n\nHe was later fined for
breaching an intervention order that legally prevented him from
approaching her before last year also being suspended from driving
for three months for driving without a licence.';</p>
