<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>Base UI =&gt; Window Standalone.</p>
<p>open modal, change orientation to portait (window allows for
landscape_left and right, but changing the device orientation has
no effect).</p></div>

<h3>Comments</h3>

<li>Blain Hamon 2011-04-15

   <div><p>Due to needs of changing the orientation before presenting a
   modal view (As to not interrupt the modal transition), the modal
   opening attachment is lost. Indeed, it's not really there to begin
   with, as opening a modal view opens it on the root Titanium View
   Controller, not by the tab/window that called it.</p>
   <p>As such, would it be acceptable that windows opened modally do
   not inherit the calling window's orientations, the same way that
   nonmodal (Yet non-tab-opened) windows also do not inherit the
   calling window's orientations?</p></div></li>
<li>Nolan Wright 2011-04-15

   <div><p>are you saying that modal windows should not inherit
   orientations of the window that opened them? if so, i agree. could
   i make this work by setting the orientationModes within a modal
   window</p></div></li>
<li>Blain Hamon 2011-04-15

   <div><p>Yes, that's what I mean. It currently still is broken, but the
   expected behavior would be that orientationModes on a modal window
   work as expected on any other opened window.</p></div></li>
