<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>Hello Guys, How are you today ? Me very Bad :(</p>
<p>Nowadays, I am trying to develop a little application for iPad
with Titanium 1.0 (+ Apple SDK 3.2).</p>
<p>I created an application "Test" just to see if everything work
very well with a last version of Titanium (1.0). Unfortunately,
when I double click on the icon of my test application, it doesn't
arrive at the end and I have again the home screen of my iPad
(emulator).</p>
<p>When I use the same environment (Titanium 1.0 + Apple SDK 3.2
beta) to laod some applications examples wrote with titanium
version 0.9.x (Example - The Kitchen Sink), they don't work. I have
to use Titanium 1.0 + release apple SDK include between 3.1 and
3.1.2 if I want to run the Titanium applications examples.</p>
<p>However, since my update to Titanium 1.0 and my update to Apple
SDK 3.2 that include some improve for iPad Development, the url
param seems to be depreciated when I write:</p>
<p>var win = Titanium.UI.createWindow({url:'index.html'});<br>
<a href="/projects/32238/changesets/ERROR" title=
"Changeset [ERROR]">[ERROR]</a> url not supported in a window.
index.html --</p>
<p>Please, Could You Help me ?</p>
<p>All my apologies for the quality of my English because it isn't
my mother tongue. I speak French :)</p></div>

   <div><p>you need to enter support issues at developer.appcelerator.com
   (under the Q&amp;A tab).</p>
   <p>you can't use html files in the url. it has to be a JS file. you
   can only create web views with the html property</p></div></li>
