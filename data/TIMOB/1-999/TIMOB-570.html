   <div><p>This is something that needs to be done in Titanium Developer,
   as it's modifying the info.plist.</p></div></li>
<li>Jeff Haynie 2011-04-15

   <div><p>For now as a workaround, create a copy of Info.plist and place
   in your project root directory. Edit it and Titanium automatically
   uses this Info.plist instead of generating one.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>Technically the bug as listed has been fixed (we now allow users
   to specify orientations). However, due to the way we force
   orientations at boot, this doesn't actually have any effect.</p>
   <p>Going to go ahead and remark the bug 'open' since it makes sense
   to fix this, rather than debating whether or not that should be a
   separate bug.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>There were numerous changes made in that last commit. However,
   it is worth noting that:</p>
   <ul>
   <li>The first listed orientation in is the orientation the device
   will display in, but ONLY on 3.2 or greater (3.1.x devices do not
   support the UISupportedInterfaceOrientations plist setting, which
   determines starting orientation)</li>
   <li>These are app-wide available orientations, unless
   overridden</li>
   <li>The listed orientations are overridden by setting new
   orientations on a window (although they come back once that window
   is closed, I believe - see the orientations.js test)</li>
   </ul>
   <p>Users who do not update their iphone build directory after
   1.5.0, and modify their tiapp.xml to include orientation
   information, may be in for an unpleasant surprise.</p></div></li>
<li>Blain Hamon 2011-04-15

   <div><p>Sure enough, plist reports proper values now.</p></div></li>
