<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>Cross-platform development between iPhone, iPad, and Android
would go a LOT smoother if you created stubs for methods that crash
Android and either map them to an alternative interface, or at
least just trap them and give the developer a message explaining
that the call won't work on Android.</p>
<p>For example, the following call works great on iPhone, but
crashes on Android:</p>
<p>win.setRightNavButton(btnTools);</p>
<p>If you could trap that call (when in Android), and turn a call
to setRightNavButton into a method that does a simple alert:</p>
<p>alert('Warning: setRightNavButton is not implemented on the
Android platform');</p>
<p>In an ideal world, an alternative object would be created (a
view, perhaps) that mimics the iPhone navbar, and setRightNavButton
would create a button on that alternative object. This would give
true cross-platform compatibility.</p></div>

   <div><p>We've chosen to have the APIs fail silently. Any APIs that don't
   should be reported as a defect. Except for a couple of select
   controls, we most likely will not create platform independent
   versions of things like navbar since that is an iPhone feature and
   not something other platform's users are expecting.</p></div></li>
