<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>I had this problem with Titanium Mobile 0.5.0 and 0.5.2.</p>
<p>I originally put my project in a folder that had an apostrophe
in it. But when I tried to run "launch app" under the "test &amp;
package" tab in Titanium Developer, I got this message:</p>
<p>sh: -c: line 0: unexpected EOF while looking for matching
<code>''&lt;br/&gt; sh: -c: line 1: syntax error: unexpected end of
file&lt;br/&gt; App Spec: specified by path /Chris's
Folder/mobiletest/build/iphone/build/Debug-iphonesimulator/mobiletest.app&lt;br/&gt;
SDK Root:
path=/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneSimulator3.0.sdk
version=3.0 name=Simulator - iPhone OS 3.0&lt;br/&gt; Session could
not be started: Error Domain=DTiPhoneSimulatorErrorDomain Code=1
UserInfo=0x2214c0 "Unknown error."One moment, building
...&lt;br/&gt; kill simulator called&lt;br/&gt; signal caught:
3&lt;br/&gt; calling log kill on 2044&lt;br/&gt; kill simulator
called</code></p>
<p>I also got an Apple warning with a yellow triangle that
said:</p>
<p>"The Application Python Quit Unexpectedly, Mac OSX and other
programs are not affected" (the usual screen you get when one of
your programs quits without warning).</p>
<p>It took a couple hours to figure it out, but once I put the
project in a folder that didn't have an apostrophe (or space) it
built correctly. Perhaps you could have a look, maybe make it more
clear that you can't have an apostrophe anywhere in the path to
your Titanium Mobile files? Thanks a million; I love your
program.</p></div>

   <div><p>Still valid, after all these years. Can be solved by escaping
   quote characters.</p></div></li>

   Tested against latest master, and this seems to be resolved now (2.1.0)</li>
<li>Dustin Hyde 2012-06-14

   Closing as Fixed.
   
   SDK: 2.1.0.v20120613210250

   OS: Snow Leopard
   Devices Tested: iPhone Simulator 5.0
   Xcode: 4.2
   
   Steps to Test:
   
   1. Create a folder with an apostrophe in the name.
   2. Add a titanium mobile project to that folder.
   3. Import the project into studio and deploy to ios simulator.
   
   Expected Result:
   
   App deploys correctly.</li>
