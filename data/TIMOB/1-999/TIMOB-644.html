   <div><p>Okay, it's the loading itself that is slow. Looking into this
   and the good news is that it's not creating unnecessary views.
   After adding a timestamp feature, the time stamps are such:<br></p>
   <pre>
   <code>[TIMESTAMP] 291851846.531215 Starting Group 0
   [TIMESTAMP] 291851847.362943 Starting Group 1
   [TIMESTAMP] 291851848.180457 Starting Group 2
   [TIMESTAMP] 291851849.009998 Starting Group 3
   [TIMESTAMP] 291851849.844547 Starting Group 4
   [TIMESTAMP] 291851850.683528 Starting Group 5
   [TIMESTAMP] 291851851.655897 Starting Group 6
   [TIMESTAMP] 291851852.515305 Starting Group 7
   [TIMESTAMP] 291851853.381860 Starting Group 8
   [TIMESTAMP] 291851854.257839 Starting Group 9
   [TIMESTAMP] 291851855.153160 Creating table view
   [TIMESTAMP] 291851855.293800 Adding table view</code>
   </pre>
   <p>Meaning that each group of 40 rows took about 0.8 seconds. In
   comparison, the table view creation was fast, and after adding, the
   result was maybe half a second or less. In other words, something
   along the proxy creation or javascript running is the performance
   hit.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>yeah, i think this might be related to incorrectly placing the
   proxy property creation on the UI thread - which is should not be
   in construction time.</p></div></li>
<li>Thomas Huelbert 2011-04-15

   <div><p>resolved during the 1.4 release - that said, I will compare the
   performance of this test case on 1.3 vs 1.4 and log a bug if the
   perf is lagging on 1.4</p>
   <p>valid, has testcase</p></div></li>
