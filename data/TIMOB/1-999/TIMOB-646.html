<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>I'm having essentially the same problem as Nils<br>
<a href=
"<a href="http://support.appcelerator.net/discussions/titanium-mobile-discussion/656-problem-with-umlaut-special-german-character-in-development-certificate/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://support.appcelerator.net/discussions/titanium-mobile-discussion/656-problem-with-umlaut-special-german-character-in-development-certificate/</a>">
<a href="http://support.appcelerator.net/discussions/titanium-mobile-discuss..." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://support.appcelerator.net/discussions/titanium-mobile-discuss...</a></a></p>
<p>My name has a character with umlaut (&ouml;) which prevents
prereq.py from doing what it should. Titanium only says
"Loading..." in the SDK version select box.</p>
<p>The patch attached to the page, which changes json parser into
simplejson, helps the python script to pass. I run it in console
and get the expected output:</p>
<p>'{"wwdr": true,"ipad": false,"sdks":
["3.1","3.1.2","3.1.3"],"iphone_dev_name": ["Bj&ouml;rn
S&ouml;derqvist (XXXXXXXXXX)"],"iphone_dist_message": "Missing
iPhone Distribution Certificate","wwdr_message":
null,"itunes_message": null,"itunes": true,"iphone_dev_message":
null,"iphone_dev": true,"iphone_dist": false,"itunes_version":
"9.0.3"}'</p>
<p>Titanium app still reads the output wrong though.</p>
<p>It works if I copy-paste the console output of patched prereq.py
like so:<br>
(line 877 of packaging.js)</p>
<p>var d = '{"wwdr": true,"ipad": false,"sdks":
["3.1","3.1.2","3.1.3"],"iphone_dev_name": ["Bj&ouml;rn
S&ouml;derqvist (XXXXXXXXXX)"],"iphone_dist_message": "Missing
iPhone Distribution Certificate","wwdr_message":
null,"itunes_message": null,"itunes": true,"iphone_dev_message":
null,"iphone_dev": true,"iphone_dist": false,"itunes_version":
"9.0.3"}'</p>
<p>Let me know if I should mail my certificate to you.</p></div>

   <div><p>Ralf, I hope you don't mind me assigning this to you but, as
   this ticket is quite old, I am not sure whether you are aware of
   it.</p>
   <p>I don't think it's affecting very many people, but someone has
   just mentioned it in the Q&amp;A, <a href=
   "<a href="http://developer.appcelerator.com/question/80841/cant-run-on-device-due-to-accent-in-developper-certificate" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://developer.appcelerator.com/question/80841/cant-run-on-device-due-to-accent-in-developper-certificate</a>">
   here</a>. If there is information that is required to resolve it,
   then it may be a good opportunity to request it from him.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>It is in deed affecting lots of people. Something like half the
   population of Scandinavia have names containing special characters.
   I would very much appreciate getting some attention to this
   ticket.</p></div></li>
