Tender issue #41</a>. As reported in Tender:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello there. I already asked concerning this issue, but the
google group got lost ... Here is my issue: The previous Beta
worked fine (the one without the login), but after the last update
i can't even log in to Titanium Developer under OS X. I registered
successfully, but every time I try to login, it just say's:
"request timed out, make sure u are connected to internet." Thats
frustrating. I installed Safari 4 too. Maybe it has to do with
that. It can't be a firewall issue, I already tried without. I
wozld really feel happy if someone could help me out with that.</p>
