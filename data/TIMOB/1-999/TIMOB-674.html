   <div><p>you sure the content measuring stuff works?....</p>
   <p>h = Math.max(h, Math.max(content.getMeasuredHeight(),
   Math.max(leftImageHeight, rightImageHeight)));</p>
   <p>given your fix (that height overrides the above), then should I
   have expected my row to have been resized, before this fix?</p>
   <p>I have a row with an images and some lables etc, the row was
   never sized to fit them.</p>
   <p>Is that a different defect - as this is specifically a fix to
   include support for height?</p></div></li>
<li>Marshall Culpepper 2011-04-15

   <div><p>Hey Dan.. looks like I may've misunderstood the purpose of this
   bug. If the row isn't growing correctly to the content size of your
   images/labels, then that would be a bug in the way that "auto"
   works. Are you explicitly setting width/height for those rows to a
   static number, or just "auto" (which is the default)?</p></div></li>
<li>Dan Mullineux 2011-04-15

   <div><p>No you understood this bug well enough... setting an explicit
   height had no effect.</p>
   <p>My comment above was made because when I saw the implementation
   of your fix it became clear to me that the existing code
   <em>should</em> have resized the row 'auto'matically by default (I
   wasn't really aware of this before). I remembered that it wasn't
   resizing with 'auto' before.</p>
   <p>So yes there are two bugs (the second one I only became aware of
   after reviewing your fix for the first)</p>
   <ol>
   <li>I want to be able to force height and width - I couldn't do
   that - you have traked and resolved that with this ticket.<br></li>
   <li>'auto' doesn't work - you should track this separately - new
   ticket. Easily reproduced in KS layout_2.</li>
   </ol></div></li>
<li>Dan Mullineux 2011-04-15

   <div><p>hmm - latest pull from HEAD looks like 'auto' is behaving
   better, possibly correctly - perhaps there is no second bug. could
   I have been seeing auto fail because i only copied over the ui
   jar.</p></div></li>
