   <div><p>As a further note to this (as it might be related), users have
   noticed that when playing a video using the VideoPlayer, switching
   the silent switch on the side of the phone on and off that audio
   continues to be heard from the speaker (without headphones plugged
   in) : this is expected, I believe.</p>
   <p>But when listening to audio playing using the Sound object,
   switching the silent/mute switch does turn the speaker off and
   on.</p>
   <p>Is this expected behavior?</p>
   <p>I guess using the AudioPlayer would have the same effect as the
   VideoPlayer?</p>
   <p>(ps: I use the Sound object for a remote url, since the
   AudioPlayer does not have the ability to provide the 'duration' of
   the remote audio - but only 'progress')</p></div></li>

   <div><p>The switch that allows audio to play while locked also allows
   audio to play when silenced/muted. Your issue will be fixed.</p></div></li>

   Closes <a href="/projects/32238/tickets/703" title=
   "Ticket #703">#703</a>: Support for different audio playback
   styles. See sound_local.js for an example. Descriptions of the
   audio modes will be posted to the lighthouse ticket for this bug.

   <div><p>Here are the new constants defined in Ti.Media that define audio
   modes:</p>
   <pre>
   <code>AUDIO_SESSION_MODE_AMBIENT: Audio is mixed with existing audio, does not play on mute/lock.
   AUDIO_SESSION_MODE_SOLO_AMBIENT: The default mode.  Audio is not mixed, does not play on mute/lock.
   AUDIO_SESSION_MODE_PLAYBACK: Audio is not mixed, does play on mute/lock.
   AUDIO_SESSION_MODE_RECORD: Default mode for recording.  Silences all playback audio.
   AUDIO_SESSION_MODE_PLAY_AND_RECORD: Allows for simultaneous playing and recording of audio.</code>
   </pre>
   <p>Please remember that while recording/playing, the setting for
   that media audio component is considered GLOBAL (this is how it's
   implemented natively; no way around it). This means that if you
   start playing one sound in the middle of another, you may get
   unpredictable results. Make sure that when mixing a window that
   supports both playing and recording to use the PLAY_AND_RECORD mode
   on everything if necessary, and to halt recording on playback (and
   possibly vice-versa) otherwise.</p></div></li>
