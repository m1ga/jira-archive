<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>I'm trying to get the iPhone simulator up and running for
KitchenSink and various other apps, but I encounter the same
problem each time.</p>
<p>The app appears to build and deploy, but each time it exits from
the simulator with:</p>
<p><a href="/projects/32238/changesets/INFO" title=
"Changeset [INFO]">[INFO]</a> Application has exited from
Simulator</p>
<p>If I open the project up in Xcode it suggests I have duplicate
'main' functions, if I go to the main.m in the "Other Sources"
directory and comment out the code, this will allow me to deploy
and run the app, but it is a huge inconvenience to do this each
time and publishing changes is a real fiddle (as it doesn't always
seem to pick them up) - does anyone know why this is happening and
what I can do to stop it happening?</p>
<p>I am on OSX 10.6.3, XCode 3.2.1, iPhone platform 3.1.3 and
Titanium Developer 1.2.1 (have tried on earlier versions)</p>
<p>All the apps work on the Android platform 2.0.1.</p>
<p>Many thanks in advance!</p></div>
