<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>I thought this might be best demonstrated with a video clip. (I
recorded it 'to' Jeff - see attached video)</p>
<p>But it's similar to that issue we had a while ago with labels
and images 'stealing' the touch event from the tableViewRow they
were in.</p>
<p>I use a vertical layout view inside my tablerows, with text
labels inside that to display varying length texts. Also an image
view in the row too (but not in the view)</p>
<p>It seems that the view is nabbing the touchdown event and not
acting like the tableRow 'click' / touchup event.</p>
<p>While it does kind of work, it's not what people are expecting,
since it seems to trigger a table touchdown event, instead of
touchup/'click'</p>
<p>I wonder it the same fix that was applied to labels and images a
while ago could also be fixed with a 'view'?</p>
<p>thanks</p></div>

   <div><p>This issue is causing the table row to think it's been clicked,
   when often the user is just trying to scroll.</p></div></li>
