   <div><p>Having a go, at don's suggestion.</p></div></li>
<li>Srini 2011-04-15

   <div><p>Is there an ETA for this? When is 1.5 due?</p></div></li>
<li>Bryan Jackson 2011-04-15

   <div><p>This one keeps bouncing to next release. Currently planning on
   using pickers in our next release, is this for sure 1.5?</p></div></li>
<li>Bill Dawson 2011-04-15

   <div><p>The following will <em>at a minimum</em> be done by 1.5:</p>
   <ul>
   <li>
   <p>A plain picker with a single column, text only (i.e., the
   "title" property of the PickerRow object).</p>
   </li>
   <li>
   <p>A date picker.</p>
   </li>
   <li>
   <p>A time picker.</p>
   </li>
   </ul>
   <p>(Android has no native support for a date+time picker.)</p>
   <p>Note that the projected date for 1.5 has not been set yet.
   However as we implement these things, we'll update this ticket and
   you'll be able to get the new stuff from our <a href=
   "<a href="http://developer.appcelerator.com/doc/mobile/get_continuous_builds" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://developer.appcelerator.com/doc/mobile/get_continuous_builds</a>">
   continuous build page</a>.</p></div></li>
<li>Bryan Jackson 2011-04-15

   <div><p>Multi-column support would be ideal. For a single column
   'picker', tableviews can already meet that need for us.</p></div></li>
<li>Bill Dawson 2011-04-15

   <div><p>Bryan,</p>
   <p>Do you mean multi-column wherein each column inside the picker
   can "spin" (so to speak) to select its own value, or do you mean
   multi-column in the sense that more than one column can be
   displayed per row of data, but when you select a row you're
   selecting the "whole thing". (If you know what I mean.) In the
   former case, each column has its own set of rows (like a date
   picker that has columns for month, day, year). In the latter case,
   there is only one set of rows.</p>
   <ul>
   <li>Bill</li>
   </ul></div></li>
<li>Bryan Jackson 2011-04-15

   <div><p>The case where each column can spin.</p>
   <p>Example:</p>
   <p>Enter height: 6' 1"</p>
   <p>Feet and inches would be selected independently.</p></div></li>
<li>Bill Dawson 2011-04-15

   <div><p>The problem is that I don't think there is native support for
   that in Android. I could be wrong about that, and I'll be checking
   more deeply later. Meanwhile, if you've seen any Android apps with
   that, let me know so I can have a look at them.</p></div></li>
<li>Bryan Jackson 2011-04-15

   <div><p>Urbanspoon did this but it wasn't a native control. They
   basically created an iPhone look-alike picker.<br></p>
   <p>It looks like you will have to roll something custom to get
   pickers to be useful on android. It looks like at least one project
   out there has started something:<br>
   <a href=
   "<a href="http://code.google.com/p/android-wheel/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://code.google.com/p/android-wheel/</a>"><a href="http://code.google.com/p/android-wheel/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://code.google.com/p/android-wheel/</a></a></p>
   <p>If you implement the default android picker I don't think it
   would be compatible at all with the iPhone version so we would end
   up with a lot of "if iphone then" code. I would hope for a custom
   wheel based implementation so it works pretty much the same on both
   platforms.</p></div></li>
<li>Bill Dawson 2011-04-15

    <div><p>Looks nice. Too bad the license is not compatible with
    Titanium.</p></div></li>
<li>Bryan Jackson 2011-04-15

    <div><p>Apache 2.0 is not compatible with GPL 3?</p>

    <div><p>We won't use any GPL'd code, no matter the license version.</p></div></li>
<li>Bill Dawson 2011-04-15

    <div><p>As a follow-up to that:</p>
    <p><a href=

    <p>It's the wrong direction of a one-way compatibility, so to
    speak.</p>
    <p>I should say I'm hardly an expert. I just know that it is
    Appcelerator's policy not to use GPL code of any version.</p></div></li>
<li>Bryan Jackson 2011-04-15

    <div><p>I contacted the author and he changed the license to Apache
    2.0</p></div></li>
<li>Bill Dawson 2011-04-15

    <div><p>update:</p>
    <p>Our <a href=
    "<a href="http://developer.appcelerator.com/doc/mobile/get_continuous_builds" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://developer.appcelerator.com/doc/mobile/get_continuous_builds</a>">
    latest code</a> contains plain picker, date picker and time picker
    (not date+time, not countdown).</p>
    <ul>
    <li>
    <p>Plain picker: this is the native Android Spinner. Supports only
    one column, and only plain text. We will adapt the to an
    iPhone-type spinner with multiple columns probably this week,
    thanks to Bryan Jackson asking the creator of <a href=
    "<a href="http://code.google.com/p/android-wheel/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://code.google.com/p/android-wheel/</a>"><a href="http://code.google.com/p/android-wheel/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://code.google.com/p/android-wheel/</a></a>
    to change the license to Apache.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Date picker: by default, also the native Android date picker.
    however we've added a special creation-time property
    <code>useSpinner: true</code> to use android-wheel, which looks
    iPhone-ish. Thanks again to Bryan.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Time picker: same as date picker in that by default it uses an
    Android native control, but you can use <code>useSpinner:
    true</code> to use the android-wheel.</p>
    </li>
    </ul></div></li>

    <div><p>Bill,</p>
    <p>I'm using the latest build and the date pickers seem to be
    working. However, I'd like to use the DatePickerDialogs, which
    seems to be implemented under showDatePickerDialog(). I'm having a
    hard time figuring out how to invoke this though. Is this function
    good to go or does something else need to be updated before it can
    be used?</p></div></li>
<li>Bill Dawson 2011-04-15

    <div><p>Ryan,</p>
    <p>This probably is not the "final way" we'll do this, but for now
    you can use it in this wacky way: create an instance of a picker
    (any picker, in fact) and call it:</p>
    <pre>
    <code class="javascript">var picker = Ti.UI.createPicker();
    picker.showDatePickerDialog({
      value: new Date(2010,8,1), // initial date to display
      callback: function(e) {
        if (e.cancel) {
          Ti.API.info('user canceled dialog');
        } else {
          Ti.API.info('user selected date: ' + e.value);
        }
      }
    });</code>
    </pre>
    <p>(I didn't test that code block. :) )</p>
    <p>This is a really strange way to do it, creating an instance of
    picker just to call this. Better would be to simply have
    <code>Ti.UI.showDatePickerDialog</code>, but we have an issue right
    now whereby "modules" like <code>Ti.UI</code> are shared across
    javascript contexts, so if we put it there the actual date dialog
    might not appear in the right place. We're working on how modules
    interact with contexts for Titanium 1.5, so -- to reiterate -- this
    may change.</p>
    <p>Regards,</p>
    <p>Bill</p></div></li>
<li>Ryan Coyner 2011-04-15

    <div><p>Thanks Bill. This works great. I'll be on the lookout for commit
    changes that affect this, but I'd also appreciate it if you could
    follow up on this thread if it becomes more complex.</p></div></li>
<li>Bill Dawson 2011-04-15

    <div><p>Note: the spinner-style (iphone-looking) picker does not
    currently support any border width attributes. I'll be working on
    that too in the coming weeks.</p></div></li>
<li>Marcin Muras 2011-04-15

    <div><p>Hi. I need time picker and tried:<br>
    var timePicker = Ti.UI.createPicker();<br></p>
    <pre>
    <code>timePicker.showTimePickerDialog({
          value: new Date(2010,8,1,1,9), // initial time to display
          callback: function(e) {
            if (e.cancel) {      
                ..
            } else {
                ..
            }
          }</code>
    </pre>
    <p>}); It works fine but how to switch between 12h/d to 24h/d
    time.<br>
    Now picker shows 12h/d time picker.</p></div></li>
<li>Bill Dawson 2011-04-15

    <div><p>Indeed, there is a property you can set for that. Sorry, this
    will all be documented eventually -- I'm just hesitating because --
    as I indicated earlier -- we're not sure if
    <code>showTimePickerDialog</code> and
    <code>showDatePickerDialog</code> will stay in the places where
    they currently are.</p>
    <p>Anyway:</p>
    <pre>
    <code class="javascript">timePicker.showTimePickerDialog({
          format24: false, // &lt;--------------------
          value: new Date(2010,8,1,1,9), // initial time to display
          callback: function(e) {
            if (e.cancel) {      
                ..
            } else {
                ..
            }
          }
    });</code>
    </pre></div></li>
<li>Zipcar (Goss) 2011-04-15

    <div><p>Is it currently possible to have the TimePicker increment by a
    certain duration (say a half hour rather than a minute)?</p>
    <p>Really glad to see this work progressing.</p></div></li>
<li>Bill Dawson 2011-04-15

    <div><p>The <a href=
    "<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/TimePicker.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/TimePicker.html</a>">
    "native" time picker</a>, which is the one you get by default,
    doesn't seem to have that capability. (Link is to Android
    docs.)</p>
    <p>The "spinner" version of the time picker, which you get by
    passing <code>useSpinner: true</code> as one of the creation
    arguments to <code>createPicker()</code>, <em>will</em> have it,
    because our Titanium API documentation (originating from our iOS
    implementation) <a href=
    "<a href="http://developer.appcelerator.com/apidoc/mobile/latest/Titanium.UI.Picker-object" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://developer.appcelerator.com/apidoc/mobile/latest/Titanium.UI.Picker-object</a>">
    says it should</a> (the <code>minuteInterval</code> property).
    Alas, I haven't coded it yet. I will "soon". (I keep saying soon
    here but I keep getting lots of other stuff I need to do. -- but i
    want this in 1.5.)</p></div></li>
<li>Jick Steen 2011-04-15

    <div><p>Currently, only the spinner supports minDate/maxDate. Will the
    picker support minDate/maxDate when 1.5 is final?</p>
    <p>Will it be possible to change the title (which currently
    displays the date eg. 'September 04 2010') of the date dialog on
    each change?</p></div></li>
