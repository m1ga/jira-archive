This means\nfor instance that while you can translate your way sliding from\nregular screen position to off screen, you can't slide from off\nscreen to regular position because you always <em>start</em> at the\nregular position.</p>\n<p>To be compatible with the iPhone implementation, I believe it\nshould be starting from the coordinates that were established by\nthe previously-set transform property on the view...? (Or does it\neven work that way?)</p>\n<p>Setting the transform property on a view appears to be\nimplemented by starting an animation, and then not actually saving\nthe transform. This at least is unintuitive, and doesn't seem to\nmatch how it works on iPhone.</p>\n<p>It also looks like the 2DMatrix class doesn't implement a matrix\nat all, but stores separate values for translation, scaling, or\nrotation factors, which are then used to trigger particular types\nof animation modes. That may be just fine, but it's a bit\nconfusing.</p>\n<p>My initial testing of an animated translate on a view also\nshowed <em>really</em> choppy animation (looked like it was\nchunking over like 20-30 pixels at a time on my Nexus 1, versus\ntotally silky-smooth motion on an iPhone 3Gs). It might be faster\nin an isolated test case, though, the app view was a bit busy in\ncontext and other items like web views that were not being animated\nmight have somehow slowed it down.</p></div>{html}",

See the following\ncode:</p>\n<p><a href=\n\"http://gist.github.com/569379\">http://gist.github.com/569379</a><br>\nArrowhead image available here:<br>\n<a href=\n\"http://img808.imageshack.us/img808/1225/taskbarmenuicon2.png\">http://img808.imageshack.us/img808/1225/taskbarmenuicon2.png</a></p>\n<p>This shows a graphical bar (a view) with an arrowhead image at\none end to make it clear what is going on. When the arrowhead image\nis clicked, the bar should flip 180 degrees clockwise, and then\nwhen it is clicked again it should reverse the motion 180\nanticlockwise to return to it's original position. And so on.</p>\n<p>However, this demonstrates two issues:</p>\n<p>1) As Brion explains, the second time the animation is activated\n(when the arrowhead is at the opposite end of the bar) the view\nresets to it's original position and then rotates it\nanti-clockwise. Obviously, this is not the desired effect, as\nexplained above.</p>\n<p>2) Although the EventListener is initially fired correctly, for\nthe second animation it is in the original position, rather than\nwhere the image is now actually positioned on the other side of the\nbar.</p></div>{html}",
