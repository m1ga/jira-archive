<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>hi,</p>
<p>Currently there is no way to create a keep-alive connections
using Titanium.Network.HTTPClient</p>
<p>This is a MUST in cases where the Server response is chunked
(Transfer-Encoding: chunked)</p>
<p>This is very urgent - for cases such as returning large JSON
Strings etc.</p>
<p>Also - using keep alive-alive connections can boost performance
since the OS can reuse the connection.</p></div>

   <div><p>should I assign this to someone? Not sure - I hope I get lucky
   :)</p>
   <p>This bug is a real show stopper.</p>
   <p>Thanks,</p>
   <p>CB.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>looks like this is probably fixed in the latest version of
   ASIHTTPRequest. We'll look into upgrading for next release.</p></div></li>
<li>CB 2011-04-15

   <div><p>I really hope that it will be possible to push this into the
   v1.3 milestone - this bug is killing my project :(</p></div></li>
<li>Jeff Haynie 2011-04-15

   <div><p>it definitely won't make 1.3 since that's probably going to come
   out of final testing today (after almost a week of testing)</p></div></li>

   <div><p>i can't tell from your lighthouse profile if you're a
   professional subscriber. if you are, make sure you have a helpdesk
   ticket with the appropriate priority set.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>I'm not - my project is in bootstrap mode and we need to be able
   to deliver the v1 of our product before we can commit to a pro
   account. I noticed that v1.4 is scheduled for June - thats pretty
   far.. Oh well...</p></div></li>

   <div><p>If this'll allow me to download multiple files from one server
   without a series of new connections, and it's not too much work,
   I'd love to see this in 1.4 too. Have Appcelerator made any local
   changes to the current ASIHTTPClient sources?</p></div></li>
<li>Jeff Haynie 2011-04-15

   <div><p>I've updated to the latest ASIHttpClient which should support
   this.</p></div></li>
<li>Damien Elmes 2011-04-15

   <div><p>I turned on keep-alive debugging and confirmed that keep alive
   is being used on subsequent connections now. Unfortunately in my
   case it didn't make a noticeable difference to speed of my
   downloads, so I'll need to look at downloading concurrently
   instead. But the upgraded library fixed the other problem I was
   having, so thanks for that.</p></div></li>

    This issue needs to be reopened. It exists in 3.2.3.</li>
