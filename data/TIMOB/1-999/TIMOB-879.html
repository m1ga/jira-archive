<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>Put this in app.js</p>
<hr>
<p>Titanium.UI.iPhone.statusBarHidden = true;</p>
<p>var webView = Titanium.UI.createWebView({url:'<a href=
"<a href="http://google.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://google.com</a>'})"><a href="http://google.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://google.com</a>'})</a>;<br>
var win = Titanium.UI.createWindow({fullscreen: true});</p>
<p>win.orientationModes = [<br></p>
<pre>
<code>Titanium.UI.PORTRAIT,
Titanium.UI.UPSIDE_PORTRAIT</code>
</pre>
<p>];</p>
<p>win.add(webView);<br>
win.open();</p>
<hr>
<p>I know that there would be no reason to limit orientationModes
for displaying google.</p>
<p>However, I am building a two player board game (like chess) in
HTML/JavaScript.</p>
<p>The idea is to replicate a real board with both players sitting
at each end of the ipad. It doesn't make sense for the board to be
an any orientation other than portrait - so ideally I need to be
able to lock the orientation to PORTRAIT or UPSIDE_PORTRAIT</p>
<p>Hunting through he docs I see there is a way to do this with
win.orientationModes, but it doesn't work in the case outlined
above.</p>
<p>I wonder if it may be that Titanium.UI.createWebView also needs
orientationModes?</p>
<p>I've tested in the simulator and on an ipad, same issue in both
places.</p>

   <div><p>I'm not sure who the general public should assign tickets to, so
   I assigned it to Bill Dawson 'cos your name came up a lot!</p></div></li>
<li>Dasher 2011-04-15

   <div><p>This also appears to be an issue on Android with the 1.3 Ti
   SDK.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>Note that setting the orientation mode works fine in Ti 1.2, but
   was broken in 1.3.<br>
   Is a fix scheduled for 1.4?</p></div></li>
<li>Stephen Tramer 2011-04-15

   <div><p>This appears to be a duplicate of a bug that either Blain or I
   fixed, relating to orientation on the iPad. With the provided test
   code I was able to get the window to orient only when in one of the
   portrait-style modes, which seems to be what you want.</p>
   <p>If this is still a problem with Android, I'd create a separate
   ticket for that. They may also have been working on orientation
   issues, I'm not sure.</p></div></li>
