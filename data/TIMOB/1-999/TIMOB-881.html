<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>It's possible for the launch process to show the whole set of
"building, compiling, installing, launching, deployed" INFO
messages even if they're not true (i.e., the emulator is not even
finished launching, so nothing is really being installed.) This
happened to me three times. All three times it was when the launch
process had to create a new AVD (because of new combo of SDK /
screen size.) So there might be a connection there.</p></div>

   <div><p>Also happened to Don on Linux, specifically when he launched an
   app and the emulator did not already exist and therefore needed to
   be created.</p></div></li>
