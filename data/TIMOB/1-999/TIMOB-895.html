<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>Whenever a response is received back from server, the
responseText is always null even though server returns valid data.
Infact it is received by Titanium because when I alter the response
then its being displayed correctly. But during all other operations
such as eval or parse, only a null value is available</p></div>
