<p>right now the split view event gives you a button, but you can
only set the title for this button then set it to the leftnavbutton
for the window. you should be able to create a new button and set
the event button so it can be fully customized</p></div>

   According to the docs, you can pass in a Ti.UI.View into the leftNavButton property and have your own custom event listener: <a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/2.1/index.html#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/2.1/index.html#</a>!/api/Titanium.UI.iPad.SplitWindow-property-leftNavButton

   This ticket appears to have been marked as resolved due to a misunderstanding of the problem being reported.  Having just reviewed the problem myself I can confirm the actual problem does appear to fail even with Ti.SDK 3.3.0.
   
   The actual problem is "When using a splitWindow; the automatic leftNavButton that is shown or hidden when the ipad is rotated has only a text property available for customisation.  Whilst it is certainly possible to provide a new button into left nav when the device is in landscape mode, doing this in portrait mode replaces that automatic functionality with a new button that then loses the ability to display the detail window.".
   
   This jira needs to re-open and the problem be re-examined.</li>
