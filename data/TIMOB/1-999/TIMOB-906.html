<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>When trying to play (stream) .m3u and .pls files in the
background, you get the following error:</p>
<p>== AUDIO ERROR == No audio data found.</p>
<p>Can someone add support for these file types?</p></div>

   <div><p>It might be best for you to actually download the file and parse
   out the mp3 urls yourself. They're usually a simple text format.
   Then you could build your own playlist array inside your app.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>It actually is for a radio streaming app which needs to access
   these file types.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>I'm getting the same issue with the video player. The m3u8 file
   contains different streams for different bandwidths.</p>
   <p>I've created a test app in Objective C using
   MPMoviePlayerController (what Titanium uses) and it plays the file
   just fine. It must be something with how Titanium is setting up the
   player.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>These are playlist files, not audio files. AudioStreamer is for
   streaming audio only but will discuss this in planning triage.
   Likely to be marked invalid.</p></div></li>

   Mark as invalid based on the last comment.</li>
