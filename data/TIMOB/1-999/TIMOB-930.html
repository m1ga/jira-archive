   <div><p>Fits in with the other coverflow bugs I have. We're going to
   have to do a rewrite.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>valid, needs testcase</p>
   <p>as noted by Nolan, when the app loads only some of the images
   are shows, scroll through, back the beginning and the right again
   shows all the images. Additional to only a subset of the images
   appearing, scrolling through is pretty clunky in that the
   animations are nto smooth.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>Do you guys know if there's been any update to this issue? We're
   currently experiencing this same problem.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>Same here, only some images are loaded.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>Hi,</p>
   <p>I don't think this isn't really fully fixed. Compared to the old
   one I think the following issues still remain:<br>
   1) There is no way easy way to prevent the default image from
   loading before other remote images</p>
   <p>2) Cover flow seems loads the images in reverse order, so when
   you first view it, there are just blank images (or the default
   image) which isn't the best experience for the user.</p>
   <p>Thanks,<br>
   James</p></div></li>

   <div><p>1) Perhaps as a future feature request, some means to define the
   default image. Note that if we did not have a default image,
   someone else would open a bug complaining about the lack of a
   default image.</p>
   <p>2) This is just the nature of remote images. There's a number of
   factors, including the speed at which the server sends back images.
   Another possibility is that the first images are requiring a DNS
   lookup and firing up the network connection, while latter images
   already have the DNS cached and possibly even still have a
   connection to the server. So the faster-loading later images
   'appear' to have loaded first, since there was less of a wait.</p>
   <p>One possible solution to remote images being slow is to make
   them not remote. For example, in the background before the
   coverflow is even used, and you know the images are going to used,
   use HTTPClient to save them locally.</p>
   <p>Either way, the original bug is fixed.</p></div></li>

    <div><p>1) I've added a new ticket here: <a href=
    "<a href="https://appcelerator.lighthouseapp.com/projects/32238-titanium-mobile/tickets/2526-option-to-set-default-image-or-have-no-default-image-on-coverflow-view" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://appcelerator.lighthouseapp.com/projects/32238-titanium-mobile/tickets/2526-option-to-set-default-image-or-have-no-default-image-on-coverflow-view</a>">
    <a href="https://appcelerator.lighthouseapp.com/projects/32238-titanium-mobi..." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://appcelerator.lighthouseapp.com/projects/32238-titanium-mobi...</a></a></p>
    <p>2) It really seems to load in reverse order, not randomly
    starting with whichever image that didn't have to go through the
    DNS. So it seems the functionality compared to the previous version
    is different. This was never an issue on the previous version. I've
    been poking around the objective C trying to figure it out, but
    would really appreciate if someone that new the code more could
    have a look.</p>
    <p>Thanks,<br>
    James</p></div></li>
