<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>Right now there is some special case code for buttons and table
rows, functionality which could very easily be implemented using
blocks. Since this is potentially a 4.0-only feature, some testing
will be necessary before making the infrastructure changes.</p></div>

   <div><p>Probably never going to happen. We've got to keep that 3.1.x
   support in there.</p></div></li>

   Ingrained in the culture. Momentum takes precedence, this bug inadequately describes the new feature and even I can't remember what the hell I was planning on doing with it.</li>
