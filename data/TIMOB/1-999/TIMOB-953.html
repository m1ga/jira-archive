   <div><p>Not fully explained. Do you mean the text color of buttons? The
   background color?</p>
   <p>Is this the toolbar buttons that have no boundary (IE, just the
   text?) or of toolbar buttons that have a border?</p>
   <p>Do note that standard UIBarButtonItems (IE, the type you expect
   to see on toolbars and navBars) do not have any mechanism for
   changing background color, text color, text font, or size of
   text.</p>
   <p>Any exposing of these properties will require us to recreate
   simulations instead of using the built-in native buttons.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>when you place a button in the toolbar (non-bar style), you
   should be able to set the background color</p></div></li>

   <div><p>Okay, I've attached a screenshot from Interface Builder to
   better illustrate things. In the picture are two bars.</p>
   <p>The top bar is of bar button items. With bar button items, we
   can set the text, OR a premade image, OR an image, and one of three
   styles: Bordered, Done, and Plain. Font is unchangeable. Text color
   is unchangeable. Background color is unchangeable, as it's based on
   the owning bar's color in the case of Bordered, and is always blue
   in the case of Done.</p>
   <p>Unrelated, but while I was researching this, I noticed a new
   premade button, of page curl, added as of 4.0, that we might want
   to introduce. It ignores the style property.</p>
   <p>The bottom bar is of buttons added to the bar. This is a
   different layout, and one we use when we have backgroundImage, etc.
   The first button is a rounded rectangle, no background color. The
   second is with the background color. Note that this background
   color is put behind the rounded rectangle, not in it. The third is
   a custom button, with no rounded rectangle, but as you can see, the
   background color is just an ugly rectangle.</p>
   <p>Finally, I made a custom button with text font, text color,
   Shadow, shadow color, and shows-touch changed to resemble the bar
   button item. However, this is a simulation. Worse yet, this is
   probably incompatible with the bordered and done styles.</p>
   <p>Bouncing back to Nolan for better clarification of what's
   desired from what we can do.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>ok, i believe this is about using the BAR style button (like the
   top ones in your screenshot), but being able to apply any
   backgroundColor to the button regardless of the bar color. We may
   already support this - can't remember.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>Ah. I think this is a case of the iPhone OS API being confusing.
   We have several items that are closely related, so that they
   overlap in some areas, and sadly not in others.</p>
   <p>UIBarButtonItems (using the native terminology here) are
   actually not buttons in that they're not views, but represent the
   buttons you see. They have no view manifestation, and can exist
   nowhere but within a bar. They come with the various built-in
   system icons and three backgrounds: plain, bordered (which ALWAYS
   is the bar's color), and done (which ALWAYS is the blue). As they
   are not views, there are no colors to set, nor is there anything to
   insert backgrounds into.</p>
   <p>UISegmentedControl is represented in Titanium as both ButtonBar
   and TabbedBar. It is a view, and has a style that resembles a
   bordered-style UIBarButtonItem. When placed directly in a bar, it
   takes on the bar's tint. However, we have fixed this to be any
   custom color before, by placing it in a view, and then placing THAT
   in the bar. And a segmented control can have only one segment. So
   this may be when we already supported it, IE, insert a button bar
   with only one element, and tint that. However, as this is not a
   UIBarButtonItem, no system-provided icons are available, nor is the
   plain and done styles supported.</p>
   <p>( We also had back buttons that were showing up as the color of
   the previous windows due to a race condition with the nav bar. This
   was only with back buttons, and was not easily recreatable. )</p>
   <p>This makes the unfavorable situation where, in order to support
   background colors, we lose system icons or worse yet, make an
   almost random set of rules about what is supported.</p>
   <p>Proposing that this be marked Invalid, with the workaround noted
   that, when someone wants to have a background color, to use a
   buttonbar instead.</p></div></li>

   This should be better explained on docs. many users struggle with Buttons, Button Colors and Backgrounds, specially when those buttons are part of a Nav bar, Tabbedbar or ButtonBar.</li>
