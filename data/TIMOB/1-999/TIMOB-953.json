With bar button items, we\ncan set the text, OR a premade image, OR an image, and one of three\nstyles: Bordered, Done, and Plain. Font is unchangeable. Text color\nis unchangeable. Background color is unchangeable, as it's based on\nthe owning bar's color in the case of Bordered, and is always blue\nin the case of Done.</p>\n<p>Unrelated, but while I was researching this, I noticed a new\npremade button, of page curl, added as of 4.0, that we might want\nto introduce. It ignores the style property.</p>\n<p>The bottom bar is of buttons added to the bar. This is a\ndifferent layout, and one we use when we have backgroundImage, etc.\nThe first button is a rounded rectangle, no background color. The\nsecond is with the background color. Note that this background\ncolor is put behind the rounded rectangle, not in it. The third is\na custom button, with no rounded rectangle, but as you can see, the\nbackground color is just an ugly rectangle.</p>\n<p>Finally, I made a custom button with text font, text color,\nShadow, shadow color, and shows-touch changed to resemble the bar\nbutton item. However, this is a simulation. Worse yet, this is\nprobably incompatible with the bordered and done styles.</p>\n<p>Bouncing back to Nolan for better clarification of what's\ndesired from what we can do.</p></div>{html}",

I think this is a case of the iPhone OS API being confusing.\nWe have several items that are closely related, so that they\noverlap in some areas, and sadly not in others.</p>\n<p>UIBarButtonItems (using the native terminology here) are\nactually not buttons in that they're not views, but represent the\nbuttons you see. They have no view manifestation, and can exist\nnowhere but within a bar. They come with the various built-in\nsystem icons and three backgrounds: plain, bordered (which ALWAYS\nis the bar's color), and done (which ALWAYS is the blue). As they\nare not views, there are no colors to set, nor is there anything to\ninsert backgrounds into.</p>\n<p>UISegmentedControl is represented in Titanium as both ButtonBar\nand TabbedBar. It is a view, and has a style that resembles a\nbordered-style UIBarButtonItem. When placed directly in a bar, it\ntakes on the bar's tint. However, we have fixed this to be any\ncustom color before, by placing it in a view, and then placing THAT\nin the bar. And a segmented control can have only one segment. So\nthis may be when we already supported it, IE, insert a button bar\nwith only one element, and tint that. However, as this is not a\nUIBarButtonItem, no system-provided icons are available, nor is the\nplain and done styles supported.</p>\n<p>( We also had back buttons that were showing up as the color of\nthe previous windows due to a race condition with the nav bar. This\nwas only with back buttons, and was not easily recreatable. )</p>\n<p>This makes the unfavorable situation where, in order to support\nbackground colors, we lose system icons or worse yet, make an\nalmost random set of rules about what is supported.</p>\n<p>Proposing that this be marked Invalid, with the workaround noted\nthat, when someone wants to have a background color, to use a\nbuttonbar instead.</p></div>{html}",
