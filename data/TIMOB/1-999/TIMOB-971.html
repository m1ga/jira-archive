   <div><p>See <a href="/projects/32238/tickets/1014" title=
   "Ticket #1014">#1014</a>. Either fixed as part of my video player
   fixes, or we can't do anything about this because of how video
   players work. I've marked it as open so that I can get my hands on
   the test and make sure it's one of these two.</p></div></li>
<li>Stephen Tramer 2011-04-15

   <div><p>Still waiting on the code to test this.</p></div></li>
<li>Blain Hamon 2011-04-15

   <div><p>Stephen: Did you ever get the code to test this?</p></div></li>
<li>Stephen Tramer 2011-04-15

   <div><p>Never got code to test, and I've never seen it since it was
   reported. Plus there were tons of video player changes in the
   interim. I'd say fixed-in-qa it but we don't have a test to test
   that it's fixed.</p></div></li>
<li>Stephen Tramer 2011-04-15

   <div><p>Might be related to another M07 bug. Going to swap back to
   'new'.</p></div></li>
<li>Stephen Tramer 2011-04-15

   <div><p>Probably invalid, bumping from M07 so it's not a firm commitment
   to check. More important things to do.</p></div></li>
<li>Stephen Tramer 2011-04-15

   <div><p>Going to fixed-in-qa this; unable to repo (as described) on any
   video player in the modern world. Unable to test against sample
   code; was never provided.</p></div></li>
<li>Thomas Huelbert 2011-04-15

   <div><p>I saw RL exhibit this behavior months ago, IIRC it was a
   scripting issue. closing</p></div></li>

   <div><p>Housekeeping! Paperwork is in order.</p></div></li>
<li>Kael 2011-04-15

    <div><p>I can reproduce the black screen issue with KitchenSink and
    KS-iPad (Titanium SDK 1.6 - iOS 4.2).</p>
    <p>On iPad:<br>
    1. KS-iPad &gt; Open Main Tests &gt; Embedded Video<br>
    2. Fullscreen &gt; and press play<br>
    3. Then press (and stay pressed) the forward button until the end
    of the video!<br>
    Then you will see the black screen!!</p>
    <p>On iPhone:<br>
    Just remove the line "win.close()" in file "movie_local.js" in
    kitchensink and process as on KS-iPad.</p></div></li>
