<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>Create a new project with Mobile SDK 1.3.0 for iPad.</p>
<p>Create a WebView for this app that opens a local HTML file (e.g.
test.html) in Resources folder</p>
<p>Put a test.css and test.js file also in your Resources
folder.</p>
<p>Try to include the CSS file with a link tag and try to include
the JS file with a script tag from test.html</p>
<p>Run the app in the iPad simulator.</p>
<p>The test.css and test.js files will not be included.</p>
<p>I would suspect that the files are either not being included in
the build, or that the include path from test.html is
incorrect.</p>
<p>Also important: You can create a 1.2.0 Mobile SDK project, and
follow the above steps, and you will have no problems. The bug does
not happen.</p>
<p>Even more interesting: After you create that 1.2.0 project, you
can convert it to 1.3.0 from the Edit Project page, and when you
run in the simulator, everything works fine. The bug does not
affect converted projects, only original 1.3.0 projects.</p></div>

   <div><p>Further testing seems to suggest this is actually not due to
   v1.2.0 versus v1.3.0 but is instead a bug caused by placing spaces
   in your project name.</p></div></li>

   No explicit test case, filer admits information is incorrect, there have been fixes with spaces in project names, ancient SDK (1.6.0, <1yr), Titanium Developer (not Studio).</li>
</ol>
