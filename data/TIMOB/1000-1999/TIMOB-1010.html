<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>Platform 1.3.0, Android 2.1</p>
<p>I have a "heavyweight" android window with menu attached. I try
to change "title" property of one menu items, after click.
Something like:<br></p>
<pre>
<code class=
"javascript">Controller.prototype.onMenuClick = function(e) {
  e.source.title = 'New title based on some condition';
}</code>
</pre>
but it doesn't work. Title is same.</div>

   <div><p>We'll look into this, but the native Tab control does not allow
   changes after creation.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>Don,<br>
   It's not a Tab, it's an Android Menu</p></div></li>

   <div><p>Ok this appears to be that the source is not what you're
   expecting. We'll definitely look into it.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>I'm on it, though a tip or source to reproduce this would be
   helpful.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>Most likely the onPropertyChange didn't get implemented for
   title and/or icon. Basically you need an app.js that creates a
   menu. You don't even need to worry about a windows. Just in the
   onclick of them menu change the title of the item. Then when you
   press the menu button again, it should show the new title.</p>
   <p>Please check icon as well.</p></div></li>
<li>Don Thorp 2011-04-15

   <div><p>We've verified that setting the menu title and icon do function
   as expected. You need to set your listener on the actual object not
   its prototype. We inject objects in Javascript from the native side
   and they're effectively wrappers around native objects. In that
   respect they don't "obey" prototype as you're expecting.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>Don,<br>
   No, it's not a problem of prototype, I have my own event manager,
   which keeps context and allows to attach and pass custom data to
   event handlers. All objects inside event handler are valid, event
   handler is executed and it works everywhere across project.</p>
   <p>I'll prepare simple project to reproduce this bug.</p></div></li>
<li>Konstantin 2011-04-15

   <div><p>Ooops, Don and Matthew, I'm very sorry, I found stupid bug in my
   source code. From now, I'll check my bug report more carefully.</p>
   <p>Sorry again</p></div></li>
