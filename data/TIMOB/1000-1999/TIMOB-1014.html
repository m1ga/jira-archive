   <div><p>Whoops! I tagged a submit with the wrong bug number. This is
   totally valid. That commit was for <a href=

   <div><p>Some investigation has revealed a number of issues with the
   media player we can't control:</p>
   <ul>
   <li>You may only have one movie view created at a time. Creating
   additional ones deallocates the view for any previously created
   players.</li>
   <li>Switching fullscreen mode automatically changes the scaling to
   'Fit'. Any attempt on our (or the user's) part to change the
   scaling property when switching fullscreen causes playback to
   halt.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>Lockup appears to be a combination of the multiple view issue,
   and something that was solved as part of <a href=
   "/projects/32238/tickets/1044" title="Ticket #1044">#1044</a>.
   After playing around with it for a while, there does not appear to
   be a good solution to the fullscreen scaling problem.</p>
   <p>Leaving this open while I figure out what to do about multiple
   movie views.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>More investigation into this bug reveals some hilarious
   peculiarities.</p>
   <p>In particular, Apple allows for us to create two movies players,
   movie1 and movie2, and to add both of their views (in 3.2 &amp;
   later) to the same window. However, only the view for the movie
   which was loaded LAST will respond and behave as though it is a
   view associated with a movie player controller, up to and including
   displaying the initial frame of a movie.</p>
   <p>However, if we call -[MPMoviePlayerController play]
   programmatically, we can change which view is 'active'. So probably
   the best way to handle movie views in 3.2 when creating more than
   one at a time is to set the thumbnail from time 0.0 as the
   backgroundView, and set an event listener which responds to clicks
   on the view as a call to 'play'.</p>
   <p>This is all going to have to happen to JS, unless we want to
   engage in a lot of reference counting of existing movie players and
   determine which one is currently active, etc. I'm marking this as
   resolved and will come up with a JS workaround for the helpdesk
   ticket mentioned above.</p></div></li>
