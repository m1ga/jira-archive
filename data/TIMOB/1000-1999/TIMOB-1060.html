<p>we need to figure out how this should work from an API
perspective (i.e., which one should be the parent container)</p></div>

   <div><p>Split views are very picky, and will throw an exception if not
   the root view. It might be possible to set up tabs within a split
   view, but this will take R&amp;D outside of Titanium to get split
   views to play well with others.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>It's worth mentioning that the sample provided in the helpdesk
   ticket is not actually a split view. Screenshots of what we presume
   the app to be reveal that it's a rather clever mockup of split:

   <p>From the documentation:</p>
   <blockquote>
   <p>The split view controller&#8217;s view should always be
   installed as the root view of your application window. You should
   never present a split view inside of a navigation or tab bar
   interface.</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>This is pretty clear. Blain is correct about split view
   controllers throwing a hissyfit if they're not the root; our own
   code confirms this. Now, we may be able to present tab controllers
   inside of a split view, but that comes with its own can of worms
   (including that the tab group controller we have relies on the root
   view controller being our own, and not the split view root
   controller).</p></div></li>

   <div><p>Marking invalid. If the user really wants tab controllers inside
   a split view they can open a new bug and we'll evaluate that
   then.</p></div></li>

   Closed as invalid.</li>
