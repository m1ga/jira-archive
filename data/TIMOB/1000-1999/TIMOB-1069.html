   <div><p>Mail that was sent to the customer:</p>
   <p>It appears that, for some reason, UITableView (The underlying
   iPhone class) treats the strings in the ClassName as identical. I'm
   not sure why this is, (It might be that it stops looking at the
   string after a set number of characters) and I'll look into it, but
   in the mean time, here's a workaround:</p>
   <p>Remove the custom className from the tableRow's creation. When
   the className property is missing, Titanium actually generates a
   classname of its own internally (Using the memory pointer as the
   unique key -- which is faster than UUIDs as a bonus), and the
   warnings and crashes went away.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>Hey Blain,<br>
   Thanks for getting back to me. I tried the workaround (eliminating
   the className property altogether) and I still get the "different
   layout than expected error" and a crash if I scroll all the way to
   the bottom and all the way back to the top in the app.js I attached
   to my ticket (I've attached it here as well). I also tried manually
   specifying a short, unique className and still got this behavior in
   the attach app.js.</p>
   <p>It's strange, I believe I've only seen this behavior when a
   ScrollView is present in a table row, but with it in there
   className seems to be totally ignored.<br></p>

   <div><p>Meant to attach the app.js file.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>Okay, I did a regression test. App.js crashes in 1.3, and does
   fine in HEAD. The difference being the fix/test for un-named
   classes happened some time since then. (I need to write these
   things down)</p>
   <p>A few solutions: 1) Either pull from HEAD and build a fresh
   post-1.3 build of Titanium, or 2) have Nolan provide you with
   same.</p>
   <p>Another workaround would be that the identifier doesn't need to
   be wholly unique, just unique within that table view. So if you
   were to simply have the row number (With no preceeding common text)
   as the className, or a counter if you intend to modify rows later
   on, that should be sufficient for unique rows.</p></div></li>

   Closes <a href="/projects/32238/tickets/1069" title=
   "Ticket #1069">#1069</a> , with debugging cleaned up: TableViewRows
   were looking at the TiUIView's subviews, instead of the views of
   their proxy's children. Most times, this is okay. But things get
   very confused very quickly with scrollable/scrolling views.
