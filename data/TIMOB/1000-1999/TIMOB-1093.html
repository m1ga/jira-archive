   <div><p>I found a potential issue with setInterval and setTimeout,
   though it may related or operating as designed the documentation
   does not mention this caveat on usage</p>
   <p>In simple app.js<br>
   1. use setInterval(testFunc,100) 2. in the testFunction just use
   Ti.API.info('interval fire'); to verify operation 3. create a
   heavywieght window by setting navBarHidden:true property and then
   open it.</p>
   <p>You should see that the timer fires until the heavywieght opens,
   remove the navBarHidden property and the event continues to fire
   even after the open.</p>
   <p>Not sure if this is a context issue or what but seems like it
   should work both with heavywieght and non-heavywieght windows since
   app.js continues to execute other in line code just fine after the
   open.</p></div></li>
