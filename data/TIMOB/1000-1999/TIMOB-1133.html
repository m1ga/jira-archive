<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>Right now view properties are set in any order because of how
-[TiProxy allKeys] works (namely, it returns the properties in any
generic order). For some classes, properties need to be set in a
very specific order, since some properties rely on others being
pre-set; so far we've had to jury-rig systems which take this into
account. Maybe a -[TiUIView propertyConfigurationOrder] function or
something that will handle this?</p></div>

   <div><p>Actually, there are two scenarios where this would be
   needed:</p>
   <p>(1) Changing those properties which are order-dependent after
   creation would damage things anyway, and so they must be
   written</p>
   <p>(2) -[TiProxy allKeys] can be overloaded to handle those
   properties which should only be set at creation time (or are
   order-dependent at creation time) as in the case of
   TiUITableViewRowProxy.</p>
   <p>Marking this invalid as a result but it's good to keep in
   mind.</p></div></li>
