<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>After taking a photo, or choosing a photo from the gallery on a
the device WITHOUT using imageEditing to crop the photo, the
orientation is always wrong.</p>
<p>To test, see the KS demo in: Phone &gt; Save To Gallery &gt;
Background Image</p>
<p>Select a photo which was taken with the iPhone and you'll see
that photos taken in portrait are set to the background rotated
right 90 degrees. Also, photos which are taken in landscape-upside
down (camera at the bottom) are rotated 180 degrees when applied to
a background.</p>
<p>This works on the simulator fine, but not on the iPhone.<br>
Also, it works OK after imageEditing has been used to make the
square version.</p>
<p>The only photos which appear correctly are those which are taken
in landscape (with the camera at the top of the phone as you hold
it)</p></div>
