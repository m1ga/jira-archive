   <div><p>Unfortunately, the helpdesk ticket does not load, so I'm not
   sure what is being asked.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>There is no way to programmatically change the volume using the
   AudioPlayer. I really need this feature myself. For example, I am
   playing a live radio stream in the AudioPlayer, and I want to
   control the volume with the slider control. There is no way to do
   this right now with the AudioPlayer. It can be done the Sound
   object (get/setVolume), but the Sound object does not work with
   streams, only audio with fixed length. Basically, We need
   (get/setVolume) on the AudoPlayer.</p>
   <p>I have been tracking this ticket, because I need the for a
   streaming radio app I'm writing...</p></div></li>

   <div><p>There has been a few questions asked in the community around
   support for this feature - would be good to add since it's a pretty
   important feature for any apps needing to do streaming audio.
   "bigdoggy007" describes the current issue - we provide
   <code>volume</code> for the Sound object, and the same is needed
   for AudioPlayer.</p></div></li>

   +1 for this feature.</li>
<li>Joel Hulen 2011-12-16

   +1 for this feature as well.</li>
<li>Frank Eijking 2012-04-05

   +1 for this feature as well.
   Can we do anything to prioritize this feature?
   
   I would like to control the volume of multiple (at least 2) AudioPlayer instances separately (just like a Sound object). In this way to be able to create a crossfade between two streamed remote audio files.
