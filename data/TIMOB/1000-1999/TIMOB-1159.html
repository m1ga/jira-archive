<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>Consider an app using a TabGroup, opening windows with
Tab.open(), and setting Window.backButtonTitle. We'll nest 3
windows inside each other - call them A, B, and C. It is possible
to cause strange behavior and even crash such an app:</p>
<p>1) starting at A, tap a button to open B<br>
2) tap a button in B to open C<br>
3) before C opens, tap B's back button<br>
4) A will appear immediately<br>
5) C will appear when it is ready<br>
6) C's back button now leads to A</p>
<p>This also works if C is just a complex View. In that case C will
render OVER A. In other cases C is doing something complex and the
app can crash.</p>
<p>Expected behavior would be for C to be canceled completely after
step 3 so that steps 5 &amp; 6 above are prevented.</p></div>

   <div><p>By the way, you won't be able to click that fast on the
   simulator, but with our app on an ipod touch, there is more than
   enough time to do it.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>I had the same problem with 1.3.0, but the "1.3.1" or 1.4.0 (?)
   from git not produce this in my application.</p>
   <p>I don't know if it was the same problem or not, but my app had
   crashed if I switched windows fast, or clicked to a not fully
   loaded view and back to previous window.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>This is very likely a race condition which may have been solved
   by certain kinds of property ordering if it is no longer
   reproducible.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>I really want to revisit this in the future of what is the
   'correct' behavior. Possibly related to opening sequence</p></div></li>

   <div><p>This merits discussion with Jeff, after talking with Blain.</p>
   <p>Added the design tag.</p></div></li>

   Closing ticket due to time passed and irrelevance. </li>
