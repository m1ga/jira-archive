<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>I would like my iPad application to support displaying content
to an external device using Apple's VGA adapter. It would be great
if Titanium Mobile exposed UIScreen to make this easy.</p>
<p>See the section on "Support for External Displays and
Projectors" at <a href=

   <div><p>This is also supported on iPhone 4 and iPod touch 4G. Its also
   not just for the VGA cable, its for the composite and component
   cables as well.</p>
   <p>I would love to see this added soon!</p></div></li>
<li>Stephen Tramer 2011-04-15

   <div><p>Need to know if there's ongoing work for supporting this.
   Assigning to Ralf so he can handle the needs-more-info.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>I would also LOVE, LOVE to see this added to Titanium Mobile</p></div></li>

   <div><p>I think it would go a long way to even just support a simple
   "mirror display" feature that mirrors the current display to the
   external display connected via the Apple VGA adapter.</p>
   <p>I just found 3 different approaches (with source code!).
   Possible you guys could just pick one of these approaches and
   implement it! Please, please! One of the approaches simply takes a
   screenshot every 0.25 seconds and pipes it to the external display,
   which is kind of a novel approach and seems conceptually
   simple.</p>
   <p>3 different ways to do mirroring, with source code:<br>

   <p>You guys should offer a bounty/sponsor option for features like
   this! I know some people that would drop $1,000 to sponsor this
   feature in a heartbeat!</p></div></li>

   <div><p>A simple mirroring is all i need, too. I have teachers who want
   to hook their device up to a projector to teach a whole class at
   once.</p></div></li>
<li>Jason Stahl 2011-04-15

   <div><p>I would imagine mirroring would satisfy a significant majority
   of needs. I would vote that it's a good first step as well.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>I saw that Kincy Clark updated this helpdesk ticket: <a href=
   "<a href="http://developer.appcelerator.com/helpdesk/view/49781#c326911" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://developer.appcelerator.com/helpdesk/view/49781#c326911</a>"><a href="http://developer.appcelerator.com/helpdesk/view/49781#c326911" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://developer.appcelerator.com/helpdesk/view/49781#c326911</a></a>
   and said you guys have a module for this? any idea when it will be
   released? Thanks.</p></div></li>
