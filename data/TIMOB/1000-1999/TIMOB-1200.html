<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>Our animation system needs to transition to the 4.0 block-based
animation style where possible. We'll need to leave in the old 3.1
code as long as we can, but block-based has better guarantees about
animations completing with the correct DidStop delegate (since it's
a block) and we can implement our own autoreverse with it that will
get rid of flicker on autoreversed animations that we currently
experience sometimes.</p></div>

   <div><p>Managed to fix the current code to allow concurrent animations a
   while ago. Autoreverse flicker is still a problem and will remain
   so until we figure out how to manage it.</p></div></li>
