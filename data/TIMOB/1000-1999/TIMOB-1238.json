(TiApplication.onTerminate never hit breakpoint). When\nuser launched the application again, it was more like a resume,\nsince it had never terminated. This meant that the same instance of\nTiApplication was being used, and singletons such as those\nmaintained in TiModule's <code>modules</code> hashmap were still\nalive. This leads to weird stuff, since the application \"kinda\"\nterminated but didn't really.</p>\n<p>To be very specific regarding that helpdesk issue: when user\nbacked out of program, AppModule's onDestroy removed itself from\nTiApplication's appEventProxies collection. When the app started up\nagain, the AppModule singleton was still alive, which means its\nconstructor did not run again, which means it was never added back\nto the Application's appEventProxies collection. So no calls to\nTi.App.fireEvent worked.</p></div>{html}",
