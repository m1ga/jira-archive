<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>There are several issues that appear when a custom
AndroidManifest is used to specify that any density is supported.
Tab Widget doesn't display correctly and text fields / fonts don't
play well with others. The attached project shows some of the
issues.</p>
<p>Marking as a feature since we don't currently include this in
testing. There may be other issues once we do.</p>
<p>Also, See <a href=

Ticket 25771</a> for more information wrt to edit fields and
layout.</p></div>

   <div><p>The specific test you included looks fine on my Evo. The
   TextView has a built-in margin around it's border that makes it
   look artificially small compared to a guide that's only slightly
   bigger. If you expand the size to a few hundred pixels, it scales
   with the size of the guide (keeping the same margin size). I've ran
   KitchenSink with anyDensity="true" and I don't notice any glaring
   problems other than smaller tab and tableview images, which should
   be expected. Marking as needs more info. We should probably open
   separate tickets for each defect that we run into that instead of
   having one all-encompassing issue like this anyway.</p></div></li>
