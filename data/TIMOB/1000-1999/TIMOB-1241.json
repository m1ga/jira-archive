The\nTextView has a built-in margin around it's border that makes it\nlook artificially small compared to a guide that's only slightly\nbigger. If you expand the size to a few hundred pixels, it scales\nwith the size of the guide (keeping the same margin size). I've ran\nKitchenSink with anyDensity=\"true\" and I don't notice any glaring\nproblems other than smaller tab and tableview images, which should\nbe expected. Marking as needs more info. We should probably open\nseparate tickets for each defect that we run into that instead of\nhaving one all-encompassing issue like this anyway.</p></div>{html}",
