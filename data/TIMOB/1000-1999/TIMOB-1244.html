   <div><p>I need this as well! Need to be able to scrub through a
   streaming song for my music player but there's no way at all to do
   it.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>Implementation on iOS is doubtful.</p></div></li>

   as the videoplay supports seeking it and playing mp3 files would it be possible to add play-in-background to the videoplayer and use it for playing audiofiles with the possiblity of seeking?</li>
