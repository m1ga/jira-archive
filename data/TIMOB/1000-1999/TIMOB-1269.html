<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>Splash Screen is the first that needs support and it needs to be
done in the Theme. Multi-D/R images are needed through out to
gracefully handle apps running on many different devices.</p></div>

   <p>For resource layout:</p>
   <p>res/drawable-ldpi/foo.png (for 120dpi)<br>
   res/drawable-mdpi/foo.png (for 160dpi -- default)<br>
   res/drawable-hdpi/foo.png (for 240dpi -- nexus 1, droid)</p>
   <p>In general it'll be most important to have native high-DPI
   images (scaling down to low-res usually doesn't look as bad as
   scaling up to high-res).</p>
   <p>I'm not sure what the full implications for say loading things
   into ImageViews would be, but it should be pretty straightforward
   for the splash screen, since that's using native Android
   layout/theme stuff. For now in StatusNet Mobile we're manually
   selecting high-res alternate images based on reported DPI, and
   letting the ImageViews "scale" them back to their native size from
   logical coordinates.</p>
   <p>For developer-provided resources... could have 'android-hdpi',
   etc subdirs in Resources alongside the 'iphone' and 'android' dirs,
   and have those copied into the correct res/whatev dirs ?</p></div></li>

   <div><p>Bill is actively working this ticket. We're still working
   through it. At the moment, images will going in
   android/images/[low|medium|high] and put put in the appropriate
   place. Scaling hi density down to medium fails if there is a
   gradient in the high density image for a photo it's probably
   ok.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>What about other images rather than splashscreen and icon? Such
   as some window or button background image, how would you target
   device with diff screen sizes and dpi?</p>
   <p>Thanks</p></div></li>

   <div><p>@Daniel please use Q&amp;A or Helpdesk for support. We do not
   provide it from our ticketing system.</p></div></li>
