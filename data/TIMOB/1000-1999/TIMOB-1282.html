<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>A customer reported that with SDK 1.3.2, after adding a picker
to a window, using the setSelectedRow worked and this does not work
in 1.3.3 from HEAD.</p>
<p>I was able to reproduce this with picker_basic.js in the Kitchen
Sink. I was able to get it to work with a setTimeout of 100ms
though which leaves me to believe that there is a delay in
component creation and being able to use methods on a component. My
picker_basic.js is attached and the setTimeout is at the bottom of
the file.</p></div>

   <div><p>It's obviously a known bug (since June 10th) as a work around
   was added to the end of contacts_groups.js here:</p>

   <p>Maybe you could ask your developers to raise tickets when they
   find bugs - rather than waiting for your clients to find them?</p></div></li>

   <div><p>I create a view, then a picker, add the picker to the view, then
   create a window and add the view to the window.</p>
   <p>THEN I call Ti.Ui.currentTab.open(win, { animated: true });</p>
   <p>Calling setSelectedRow BEFORE the open doesn't work, calling it
   AFTER does.</p>
   <p>So not sure this is 100% fixed - much better though - thanks</p>
   <p>p.s. you may want to update your contacts_groups.js example</p></div></li>

   <div><p>We are currently working on some internal changes which will
   likely go in post-1.4.0 that may be able to solve this problem. For
   now, I recommend that you call setSelectedRow() in an event
   listener for win.open().</p></div></li>
<li>ranguard 2011-04-15

   <div><p>Great thanks - could you open a new ticket for '1.5' to that
   effect - just so others can find out it is a know problem.</p></div></li>
<li>Stephen Tramer 2011-04-15

   <div><p>Re-opening. This can probably be fixed by Blain's changes to the
   view loading system; we'll need to look into it. Right now it looks
   like a view can attach before a window is properly opened, a little
   more work is necessary.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>Hey guys - Worked on this for about an hour and can't really
   find a way to get this to work when opening a Picker in a Popover.
   The Popover and Picker are instantiated within an Event
   Handler.<br></p>
   <p>Picker populates just fine, but setSelectedRow won't work. Tried
   fireEvents and timing changes. Bringing this up as Picker in
   Popover are part of the HIG.</p>
   <p>"Present a picker or date and time picker only within a
   popover."</p>
   <p>Cheers! :-)</p></div></li>

   <div><p>I'm quite sure I fixed this one due to a different bug, but I'll
   have to look after 1.5.0</p></div></li>
<li>Stephen Tramer 2011-04-15

   <div><p>Appears to be an Apple bug involving when a picker row can be
   set (it must, apparently, be attacked to the topmost level view).
   Going to look into a workaround.</p></div></li>

    <div><p>TESTING THIS BUG:</p>
    <p>The behavior for the Popover test on KS-iPad has changed. The
    behavior should now be:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Click on 'Show popover 2' (display picker in popover)</li>
    <li>The selected row should be the second row</li>
    </ul></div></li>
