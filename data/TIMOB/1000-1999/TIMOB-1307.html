   <div><p>Not seeing this described behavior in any of the movie tests.
   Please provide some more information, including exactly which test
   is failing and what state you're seeing.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>sorry Steve, there not even close to enough info here. The issue
   is with 3.1.2 devices, and the button which scales the video to the
   edges of the screen.</p>
   <p>Using a device with 3.1.2 and kitchensink:<br>
   1.phone&gt;play movie&gt;local<br>
   2.when the movie UI loads, tap the button in the top right hand
   corner of the window</p>
   <p>results: the button changes state, but nothing occurs to the
   video</p>
   <p>3.tap it again</p>
   <p>results: move changes to fit screen</p>
   <p>It seems we shows the wrong default state for the button on
   3.1.2.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>Bumping from M07. Will return to it if there's time.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>I had a novella here but lighthouse ate it. I'm not typing it
   all up again, but here's the gist:</p>
   <p>This is an apple bug. Either MPMovieScalingModeFill doesn't work
   or is functionally equivalent (for whatever reason) to
   MPMovieScalingModeAspectFill in this case. Regardless, because it
   is, when we click on the box in the upper right, it transitions to
   the "other" aspect mode which, for us, looks exactly the same as
   MPMovieScalingModeFill in this event.</p>
   <p>Going to tag needs-more-info while we figure out how to deal
   with apple bugs that will never be resolved.</p></div></li>
<li>Stephen Tramer 2011-04-15

   <div><p>Bumping back into M07 as well.</p></div></li>
<li>Stephen Tramer 2011-04-15

   <div><p>Tagging resolved as per Thom.</p></div></li>

   Additional behavior to record for posterity: On iPad 3.2 the tap to bring up the movie control is not reliable. Since this issue related to the native behavior on the video playback, I am commenting here to track.</li>
