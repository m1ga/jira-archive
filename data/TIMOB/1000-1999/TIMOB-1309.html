<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>Please add this easy function in automatic mode: Sharing Files
with the User</p>
<p>From SDK documentation.<br>
Applications that want to make user data files accessible can do so
using application file sharing. File sharing enables the
application to expose the contents of its /Documents directory to
the user through iTunes. The user can then move files back and
forth between the device and a desktop computer. This feature does
not allow your application to share files with other applications
on the same device, though. To share data and files between
applications, you must the pasteboard or a document interaction
controller object.</p>
<p>To enable file sharing for your application, do the
following:</p>
<p>1.Add the UIFileSharingEnabled key to your application&#8217;s
Info.plist file and set the value of the key to YES.<br>
2.Put whatever files you want to share in your application&#8217;s
Documents directory.<br>
3.When the device is plugged into the user&#8217;s computer, iTunes
9.1 displays a File Sharing section in the Apps tab of the selected
device.<br>
4.The user can add files to this directory or move files to the
desktop.</p>
<p>Applications that support file sharing should be able to
recognize when files have been added to the Documents directory and
respond appropriately. For example, your application might make the
contents of any new files available from its interface. You should
never present the user with the list of files in this directory and
ask them to decide what to do with those files.</p>
<p>Important: In iTunes, users can manipulate only the top-level
items in the Documents directory. Users cannot see the contents of
subdirectories but can delete those directories or copy their
contents to the desktop. You should take this into consideration
when deciding where to put files in this directory.</p>
<p>To make it work manual:<br>
If you edit plist.info in /Library/Application
Support/Titanium/mobilesdk/osx/1.3.X/iphone<br>
works perfect!<br>
Just be carefull to set "YES" the UIFileSharingEnabled key in the
plist as boolean value type, otherwise xcode get it as string and
filesharing won't work.</p></div>

   This is such a trivial fix it would be really great if this could be done. There are many requests and questions about this in the Q&A</li>
