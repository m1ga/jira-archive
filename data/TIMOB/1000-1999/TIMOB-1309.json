		"description": "{html}<div><p>Please add this easy function in automatic mode: Sharing Files\r\nwith the User</p>\r\n<p>From SDK documentation.<br>\r\nApplications that want to make user data files accessible can do so\r\nusing application file sharing. File sharing enables the\r\napplication to expose the contents of its /Documents directory to\r\nthe user through iTunes. The user can then move files back and\r\nforth between the device and a desktop computer. This feature does\r\nnot allow your application to share files with other applications\r\non the same device, though. To share data and files between\r\napplications, you must the pasteboard or a document interaction\r\ncontroller object.</p>\r\n<p>To enable file sharing for your application, do the\r\nfollowing:</p>\r\n<p>1.Add the UIFileSharingEnabled key to your application&#8217;s\r\nInfo.plist file and set the value of the key to YES.<br>\r\n2.Put whatever files you want to share in your application&#8217;s\r\nDocuments directory.<br>\r\n3.When the device is plugged into the user&#8217;s computer, iTunes\r\n9.1 displays a File Sharing section in the Apps tab of the selected\r\ndevice.<br>\r\n4.The user can add files to this directory or move files to the\r\ndesktop.</p>\r\n<p>Applications that support file sharing should be able to\r\nrecognize when files have been added to the Documents directory and\r\nrespond appropriately. For example, your application might make the\r\ncontents of any new files available from its interface. You should\r\nnever present the user with the list of files in this directory and\r\nask them to decide what to do with those files.</p>\r\n<p>Important: In iTunes, users can manipulate only the top-level\r\nitems in the Documents directory. Users cannot see the contents of\r\nsubdirectories but can delete those directories or copy their\r\ncontents to the desktop. You should take this into consideration\r\nwhen deciding where to put files in this directory.</p>\r\n<p>To make it work manual:<br>\r\nIf you edit plist.info in /Library/Application\r\nSupport/Titanium/mobilesdk/osx/1.3.X/iphone<br>\r\nworks perfect!<br>\r\nJust be carefull to set \"YES\" the UIFileSharingEnabled key in the\r\nplist as boolean value type, otherwise xcode get it as string and\r\nfilesharing won't work.</p></div>{html}",
