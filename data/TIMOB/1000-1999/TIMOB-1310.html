<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>dasher: I think the streetView issue is an artifact of the view
not being invalidated. If you switch to hyb view - it doesn't
invalidate - and therefore doesn't show streetView until you move
or zoom. If you do nothing else but use the menu to
removeAllAnnotations - it invalidates and suddenly you're seeing
the streetView and it appears to be related</p></div>

   <div><p>Steps to replicate:</p>
   <p>1) Open KS in the simulator or an Android device<br>
   2) Base UI Tab<br>
   3) Select Views<br>
   4) Select Map View - map should display ok<br>
   5) Zoom in 7 times (to remove any latency assoc with having too
   much data to retrieve that might cloud the test)<br>
   6) Wait until the display has loaded<br>
   7) Press the Menu Button (carefully) &amp; Select Hyb (Street
   View)<br>
   -&gt; Map will remain the same without any street overlay</p>
   <p>8) Gently Touch the map (simple touch/click or a small move)<br>
   -&gt; Map will update with street overlay</p>
   <p>Repeat the above steps up to and including stage 7.<br>
   8) Press the Menu Button (carefully), Select More, Select Remove
   All<br>
   -&gt; Map will update with the street overlay</p>
   <p>There's an underlying problem with the streetView flag - using
   invalidate doesn't actually invalidate the view and cause a
   redraw.<br>
   I'm not sure there is an easy way to fix this issue without a hack
   wrt to annotations - but it might just need more thought &amp;
   further investigation.</p></div></li>

   I'm unable to reproduce the actual issue itself, but as soon as you try to load in the hybrid view, nothing happens. Tested on a Samsung Galaxy S2 using TiSDK 2.2.0v20120814103312. All the other map types seem to work, except the hybrid.

   Resolving ticket as Invalid as there is now a new version of Kitchen Sink available and we no longer support the version which relates to this ticket.</li>
