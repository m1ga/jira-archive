<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>You can see this using KitchenSink (the regular, non iPad
version)</p>
<p>1.Start in portrait orientation, and lock the screen orientation
by way of the hardware switch on the ipad<br>
2.KS&gt;Phone Tab&gt; Orientation<br>
3.Tap "set landscape"</p>
<p>results: the ipad UI and the apps UI changes to landscape</p>
<p>expected: should we not respect the lock?</p></div>

   <div><p>Unfortunately, we're unable to even detect the lock, and Apple's
   apps all make this moot by never setting orientation or restricting
   orientation.</p>
   <p>I guess the analogy I can use is playing video in 3.1.3, where
   the screen rotates despite the device's orientation. Other issue is
   that I know others will think this fix would be a bug in their
   eyes. Simply put, on iPad, the end developer should not be
   restricting or setting the orientation either way.</p>
   <p>Suggesting to mark as 'invalid', but deferring to Tom and Nolan.
   Suggesting also that we note to end developers to not set
   orientation unless they really really really have a good reason, as
   it goes against Apple's guidelines.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>No update, still no way to detect the lock. Marking invalid.</p></div></li>

   Closing as invalid.</li>
