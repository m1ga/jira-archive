<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>Platform: Android</p>
<p>Currently the hasChild graphic (and hasDetail, when it is
implemented for Android) is shown at a set distance from the right
hand edge of the table, and it is currently not affected by the
"right" property. A way to line these up with graphics in other
rows would be useful.</p></div>

   <div><p>I have to mark this as invalid. The indicators are not part of
   the "content" region of the row. It's a feature we inherited from
   iphone. You cannot adjust the placement. So when an indicator is
   added what it does is shrink the content region however much it
   needs to.</p>
   <p>It might be best if you hop on IRC or open a Q&amp;A issue first
   before creating tickets or feature requests. We really only want
   committed items to be tracked in lighthouse.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>OK, Don, I understand the need to close this ticket.</p>
   <p>I also appreciate what you are saying about feature requests. To
   be fair, this is the first of my tickets that have been marked as
   invalid, from what I can tell.</p>
   <p>Have you considered something like <a href=
   "<a href="https://uservoice.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://uservoice.com/</a>"><a href="https://uservoice.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://uservoice.com/</a></a> (or better
   still, something similar that is integrated into your current user
   accounts) to allow users to raise feature requests without diluting
   your other systems while at the same time helping you to better
   understand popular user needs?</p>
   <p>Cheers</p></div></li>

   <div><p>It doesn't get used often but the Google Group is used for
   features. Q&amp;A is probably the next best place. There are
   usually several people in #titanium_dev on irc.freenode.net where
   we talk about dev related issues as well.</p></div></li>
