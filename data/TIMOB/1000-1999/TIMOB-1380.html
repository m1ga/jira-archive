   <div><p>Not seeing this on simulator. Is it only reproducible on
   device?</p></div></li>
<li>Stephen Tramer 2011-04-15

   <div><p>Passing back to Blain. Simulator runs 4.0 only, and 4.0.1 is a
   fix for 3G/3GS/iPhone 4 devices only. Can't test on my 3GT.</p></div></li>
<li>Jeff Haynie 2011-04-15

   <div><p>i'm running 4.0.1 and not seeing this right now.</p></div></li>
<li>Dave Morehouse 2011-04-15

   <div><p>I have seen this issue when using the simulator. See my bug
   <a href="/projects/32238/tickets/1418" title=
   "Ticket #1418">#1418</a>.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>I am affected by this using the iPhone simulator (and also
   device IIRC).</p>
   <p>Titanium SDK 1.4.0 and iOS SDK 4.0.1.</p>
   <p>Workaround: Opening the project in XCode, it prints to
   <em>its</em> console when run from inside XCode. The turnaround
   time between each code change and when it can run in XCode is very
   long, because I'm forced to do a Clean and complete rebuild in
   XCode for it to pick up changed js files in Resources.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>Recently I'm seeing messages like app events printed, but not my
   own debug statements. To work around it, I do something like</p>
   <p>tail -f /Users/dae/Library/Application\ Support/iPhone\
   Simulator/4.0.1/Applications/4F82A24E-BF69-4903-8BBC-9C6CD9038A9F/Documents/810049d2-a099-457c-923d-ec1c3930dd6f.log</p></div></li>
<li>Blain Hamon 2011-04-15

   <div><p>Not sure what can be done at the Titanium engine side, since
   it's still just outputting to stderr, and there's no redirection.
   Is this something that's Titanium Developer-side?</p></div></li>
<li>ctredway 2011-04-15

   <div><p>Doing what Jeff added to the bottom of this blog post fixed this
   for me.</p>

   <div><p>Okay, so are we marking this fixed in QA, pending Jeff's fixes
   for Titanium Developer?</p></div></li>
<li>gero 2011-04-15

    <div><p>Maybe a hint: Logging was broken for me (the fix from the blog
    post did not help) until I explicitely deleted the app on the
    simulator. Since the next installation/run it worked again.
    Obviously this is a reason why many testers can reproduce the issue
    and others can't.</p></div></li>
<li>Thomas Huelbert 2011-04-15

    <div><p>Using 1.4.1 f88b9e, I am able to log app events and custom
    statements on devices with 3.1.2. 4.0 and 4.0.1 running. I also
    checked simulators without issue. Good note above about deleting
    old instances of the app.</p></div></li>

    This is still broken on 1.6.2 - an accurate description (and workaround) for the problem was posted by a community member here:

<li>Kevin Whinnery 2011-05-12

    This is a reproducible issue in 1.6.2 - see this community Q&A thread, an the necessary fix.  I was experiencing this with my Xcode install.
