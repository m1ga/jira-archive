<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>Facebook has switched to using OAuth 2.0 for it's authentication
see (<a href=
"<a href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/authentication)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://developers.facebook.com/docs/authentication)</a>"><a href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/authentication)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://developers.facebook.com/docs/authentication)</a></a>.
This new authentication strategy has several significant benefits
over the old way of authenticating.<br>
1) The client only needs the App Id and not the Secret Key. No more
exposing your secret key or proxying authentication calls through
your servers.<br>
2) The session object that is returned now holds enough information
for the server to validate that the response came from Facebook (so
only the application server has the secret key)<br>
3) Extended application permission control has been added to the
Facebook Connect authentication. (<a href=

4) You can now use the access_token to easily call the graph API
without the need to calculate signatures</p></div>

   <div><p>+1 for moving this one up the list, would be nice to have
   this</p></div></li>

   <div><p>+1 for this. Seems like this needs an overhaul pretty badly.
   Many posts in Q&amp;A and Helpdesk are related to the
   currently-very-broken implementation (When using extended
   permissions such as offline access and requesting multiple
   permissions at a time).</p>
   <p>More-so, the ability to request all permissions at login time
   (preventing multiple windows) would be nice.</p></div></li>

   For iOS 1.7.2 AND 1.8 CI dialog posts are breaking.  1.7.2 seems to work for android, but 1.8 does not work for android or iOS.  It seems that the login is working, and graph APIs, but dialog posting does not work.  This can be tested in Kitchen Sink.</li>
