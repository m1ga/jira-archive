   On the iOS side, ActivityIndicator is a view that can be used anywhere, and there is no pre-built indicator that blocks UI, like ActivityIndicator does on Android. This means the usage of ActivityIndicator is very different on both platforms.
   
   Perhaps there should be a blocking ProgressDialog on both platforms, with ActivityIndicator used as a indeterminate progress view and ProgressBar as a determinate progress view? This would break some things in the short term, but bring the programming model into closer alignment.
