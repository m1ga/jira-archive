<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>The following code runs fine on the iPhone 3GS, the iPhone
simulator and the iPad simulator when the app is built with SDK
1.3.2. When building the same code with SDK 1.4.0 it renders
extremely slow on the iPhone 3GS. You can see the individual rows
becoming visible one after the other and when you try to scroll
right after the first rows have been painted, you can see that it
takes really long for the next rows to show up. I can see the same
behaviour in the iPad simulator (another issue is that you have to
click somewhere in the simulator to make the table visible at all).
Only the iPhone simulator works fine with SDK 1.4.0 as well.</p>
<pre>
<code>Titanium.UI.setBackgroundColor('#000');
var win = Titanium.UI.createWindow();
var rows = [];
for (var i = 0; i &lt; 200; i++) {
    rows[i] = Titanium.UI.createTableViewRow({className:'test'});
    rows[i].add(Titanium.UI.createLabel({text:'row ' + i}));
}
var table = Titanium.UI.createTableView({data:rows});
win.add(table);
win.open();</code>
</pre></div>

   <div><p>I'm seeing similar drop offs in tableView performance with 1.4.
   Noticeable lags when setting data.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>I also found this performance issue!!!!</p></div></li>

   <div><p>I also have seen this (was this reported previously under
   another ticket?) Also, rows in the TableView will not be painted as
   long as the screen is moving, so if you "flick" the screen to move
   down, nothing appears until the motion stops, then the rows appear,
   one-by-one. Really annoying and confusing to the user, since they
   cannot see where they are for some time.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>Ran into this recently.</p>
   <p>I have a TableView with no more than 10 rows. The rows do store
   a bit of data (I used JSON.stringify() on some objects to store
   them in a DB and I parse them to populate each row.<br>
   When I open the window that has the TableView it can take between
   10-20sec to load. Once rendered performance is OK.</p>
   <p>Hope this helps.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>jbermudez: I'd make sure that the loading time isn't due
   primarily to the JSON-related operations you're doing. JSON parsing
   with Titanium can take a LONG time if you're dealing with a lot of
   JSON.</p></div></li>
<li>jbermudez 2011-04-15

   <div><p>Robby:<br>
   I will remove the JSON parsing from my table view operations and
   run them after. I will post test results.</p>
   <p>Thanks.</p></div></li>
<li>jbermudez 2011-04-15

   <div><p>Robby:<br>
   Removing the JSON.parse() from the operations in my tableview do
   speed up the process but I still get a 2 second delay before the
   TableView gets rendered. I had another project with similar
   tableview setup and before 1.4 did not have that type of delay.</p></div></li>
<li>Michael Descher 2011-04-15

   <div><p>The 10 lines of simple code in the original post clearly show
   that there must be a non-json-parsing related problem with table
   views in 1.4.0 which was not there in 1.3.2. It was reported about
   6 weeks ago and nothing has been done. I am sure the people at
   Appcelerator have many issues to look at and to solve, but table
   views are an essential feature used in many apps, so I wonder why
   this bug is not fixed yet. I will most likely start native iPhone
   programming soon since I cannot rely on a framework with such
   problems. I am still on 1.3.2 which I patched myself with the
   latest video player code since the one in 1.3.2 had too many
   problems for my app.</p></div></li>

    <div><p>yes,I agree to Michael Descher, The talbleview's problem is very
    hard for us, please solve it!!!!</p></div></li>

    Tested on an iPhone 3GS using TiSDK 2.2.0v20120814103312, there does seem to be a bit of a lag when scrolling. </li>

    Resolving ticket as Invalid as we are now on SDK 6.0.4 GA and this ticket hasn't been touched for a number of years.</li>
