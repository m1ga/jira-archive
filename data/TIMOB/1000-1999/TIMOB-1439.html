<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>A customer reported today that if he puts a slider in a table
row, infinite change results occur. I have verified this in his
code by removing the slider from the table row and the events are
not fired. Attaching his files as they are test files.</p>
<p>This happens on iOS 4 and sdk 1.4</p></div>

   <div><p>Note to self/update. This is happening because the label is
   height 'auto', and as such, triggers childWillResize in the table
   row, which triggers a reload. The reload aborts the dragging.</p>
   <p>The workaround is to have the label height be constant, which
   wouldn't trigger this, or to have the label outside of the
   table.</p>
   <p>This needs addressing in the layout refactor; doing a reload is
   too heavy handed when there's no actual row size change, yet
   currently the row won't change the layout otherwise.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>This may have been fixed in the layout refactor, but circle back
   to TBS.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>Somehow slipped through the cracks; there's a test in bugtests
   for <a href="/projects/32238/tickets/1439" title=
   "Ticket #1439">#1439</a>.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>Tested with the code provided and works as expected.</p>
