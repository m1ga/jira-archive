<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>Since internal storage is very small on many Android phones,
users are pretty leery about large app packages. A new feature in
Android 2.2 (Froyo) is allowing applications to be installed to the
SD card / mass storage instead of internal storage, or later moved
there:</p>

<a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/appendix/install-location.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://developer.android.com/guide/appendix/install-location.html</a></a></p>
<p>The application manifest needs to declare support for this:</p>
<p>'To allow the system to install your application on the external
storage, modify your manifest file to include the
android:installLocation attribute in the element, with a value of
either "preferExternal" or "auto".'</p></div>

   <div><p>To support this feature we will have to move to API-8 tooling
   and leave minSdkVersion at 4. This could cause some backward
   compatibility issues so we'll need a full regression pass if we do
   it. We might also need to find a way to force using API 4 tooling
   so we can verify we haven't tried to use any new APIs in a
   non-backward compatible way.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>More and more android devices are shipping with 2.2 in India
   with low memory on board. Most people install the apps on the SD
   card because of this issue. Can you pls push this 1.5.1? Otherwise
   it would be a missed opportunity. We are already hearing complaints
   of crashing :(</p>
   <p>Thoughts?</p></div></li>
<li>Don Thorp 2011-04-15

   <div><p>@Taazza you might be able to accomplish it with 1.5.0. You'll
   need to set the api tooling level to 8 in your tiapp.xml and add
   the declaration to enable it as well. I'll move it to 1.5.1 for
   consideration, but it may slide further out</p></div></li>

   <div><p>Nathaniel, verify if this can be done via configuration with
   1.5.0. If not figure out what we need to do to support the
   feature.</p></div></li>
<li>Taazza 2011-04-15

   <div><p>We will check it at our end. Meanwhile any updates from
   Nathaniel which pushed this to 1.6? Thank you!</p></div></li>

   <div><p>We are working on scheduling and tickets will be moved around as
   we finalize schedules and adapt to resources.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>This is supported without and changes required as of 1.5.1. I
   tested with KS by adding the following entries in
   <code>tiapp.xml</code> in the <code>android</code> section.</p>
   <pre>
   <code class="xml"> &lt;tool-api-level&gt;8&lt;/tool-api-level&gt;
       &lt;manifest android:installLocation="auto"&gt;
           &lt;uses-sdk android:minSdkVersion="4" /&gt;
       &lt;/manifest&gt;</code>

   <p>Setting to resolved since I basically did the testing during the
