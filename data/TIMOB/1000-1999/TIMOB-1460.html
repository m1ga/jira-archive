<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>I just upgraded my version of Titanium to 1.4.0 and for some
reason, my custom app is not working with the Android emulator, the
iPhone on-device testing or for Android Market distribution.</p>
<p>The Android tab isn't there at all on the Run on Device page and
it says that my "project is not configured to run for Android" on
the Distribution page's Android tab. This wasn't happening before I
upgraded.</p>
<p>I can run KitchenSink fine and everything there (on-device and
simulator) works fine for Android, but only on the KitchenSink
project; not on my custom project. For reference, my Android SDK
path is set to
/Users/*/Downloads/android-sdk-mac_86/platforms/android-8 .</p></div>

   <div><p>the path should be set to
   /Users/*/Downloads/android-sdk-mac_86</p>
   <p>in the future please use Q&amp;A or helpdesk for bug reports.
   Thanks!</p></div></li>

   <div><p>I've changed the path and created a QA item (below). I also
   checked with another QA item and it talked about replacing the
   Android.py file, which I did and that did not help. The previous
   ticket/bug (<a href=
   "<a href="http://go.grantd.net/c03iDv" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://go.grantd.net/c03iDv</a>"><a href="http://go.grantd.net/c03iDv" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://go.grantd.net/c03iDv</a></a>)
   report said the issue had been fixed, but that's not the case.</p>
   <p>I can't compile for Android on my custom app at all. I really
   don't know why I downloaded v1.4 because it has been nothing but
   trouble for me.</p>
