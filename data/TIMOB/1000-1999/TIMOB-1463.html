   <div><p>I'm still seeing this behaviour on 1.6.0 - it's quite
   frustrating because there's no way to tell whether an attempt to
   play a movie was successful or not (i.e. the movie file exists, but
   for some reason iOS can't play it). This can cause usability
   problems, since the movie controls don't display until the movie
   has started; if the movie fails to play the user is effectively
   locked out of the application, as there is no way to return to the
   previous screen.</p></div></li>

   Changing ticket to feature request; docs indicate that "preload" is not available on iOS. We may not be able to offer it due to the way that the media player behaves.</li>
