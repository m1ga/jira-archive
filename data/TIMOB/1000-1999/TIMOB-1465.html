<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>I have a text field and some code to focus the next text field
on the screen when the return key is tapped:</p>
<pre>
<code class="javascript">var txt = Titanium.UI.createTextField({
  height: 35,
  width: 200,
  right: 10,
  borderStyle = Titanium.UI.INPUT_BORDERSTYLE_LINE,
  autocorrect = false
});
txt.addEventListener('return', function()
{
  nextTextField.focus();
});</code>
</pre>
<p>The problem is that about 60-90% of the time, the keyboard
bounces down and up just a little bit before the next field is
focused. I don't want this to happen; the keyboard should not move
while the next text field is receiving focus because it's very
distracting to the user.</p></div>

   <div><p>I'm having this same issue on my iPhone 4 device (but not in the
   simulator).</p>

   <div><p>I have tested android for this issue and, as of the latest build
   1.4.x, android is <em>not</em> affected.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>Adding suppressReturn=false to the textfield seems to fix the
   problem. No idea why this works.</p>
   <p>I would think that suppressReturn=false would mean "No, do NOT
   suppress the default handling of the Return key, which would be to
   unfocus the text field" and suppressReturn=true would mean, "Yes,
   please DO suppress the default handling of the Return key. Do
   nothing when return is pressed, instead relying on the application
   to provide an event handler via the 'return' event on the
   textfield."</p></div></li>

   Fixed as part of TIMOB-628 fixes. See docs for behavior of suppressReturn</li>
