<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>Community member reported the following issue with table views
which I have confirmed on a 1.4.0 and 1.4.1 pre-release build.
Here's the Q&amp;A issue:</p>
<p><a href=
"<a href="http://developer.appcelerator.com/question/48511/tableview-without-a-tabgroup--no-rows-bug" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://developer.appcelerator.com/question/48511/tableview-without-a-tabgroup--no-rows-bug</a>">

<p>To see it in action, try to open this window standalone in
app.js (i.e. not in a tab group), and you will notice that the rows
added to the table view section do not display. If you add the same
window to a tab group, the rows are displayed fine.</p>

   <div><p>Hi,</p>
   <p>Is there any update on this issue? I can't seem to find a
   workaround to get custom layouts happening in a table view that
   doesn't belong to a window inside a tab group. This seems like a
   pretty important bug no?</p>
   <p>I also notice this problem (with table views and tab groups)
   manifests itself in the KitchenSink. You might have to try a few
   times - go to Phone, Camera, one of the camera examples and then
   back to the examples list. You find in some cases the table is
   re-rendered without any of the tab groups. At this point the table
   no longer accepts events and the app effectively is dead. There is
   no way to navigate. The only way to recover is to kill the app via
   the iOS 4's background tasks.</p>
   <p>Is there a workaround?</p>
   <p>thanks,<br>

   <div><p>Is this not being fixed for 1.5? It's a huge bug, reported 4
   months ago, and confirmed by an Appcelerator dev. I'm using a
   continuous build from yesterday and it's still broken.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>I can't even begin to describe the amount of suffering this bug
   has caused and is still causing me to this day. I can't believe
   it's not being addressed for 1.5.</p></div></li>

   rollback wrong update</li>
<li>Neeraj Gupta 2012-06-25

   This issue has probably been fixed as a part of some other fix. We cannot reproduce it with the 2.1.0 release.</li>

   Closing ticket as the issue cannot be reproduced.</li>
