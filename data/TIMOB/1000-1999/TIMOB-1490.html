<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>Not sure how to address this one. It appears that the Android OS
doesn't guarantee when it will call events on activities. For
example it's possible for a hidden activity to have onStart called
before onStop. Or it at least appears that way. It doesn't provide.
Therefore it's not possible to successfully destroy a single
resource like MapView.</p>

   I have this problem. Focus and blur seem to only fire when the window is initially opened/closed, and not after that point. I have to synthesize focus/blur events like so:
   
   <code><pre>
   open: function(params) {
   	var self = this;
   	self.win.open(params);
   
   	if (Ti.Platform.name == "android") {
   		self.focus(); // run focus callback to workaround Android/Ti issue.
   	}
   },
   close: function(params) {
   	var self = this;
   
   	if (Ti.Platform.name == "android") {
   		self.blur(); // run blur callback to workaround Android/Ti issue.
   	}
   
   	self.win.close(params);
   }
   </pre></code>
   
   Note that these functions are members of a map/object, which is why their syntax is sort of weird.</li>
