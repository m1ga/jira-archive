<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>When I open KitchenSink application in Eclipse (JavaScript
edition) it shows 151 errors and 427 warnings. As the baseline
sample app, this seems like it should be fairly clean as it could
add subtle errors to users code as they use elements of this code
as a starting point. Also, I have found a number of files in the
kitchensink application which are no longer used.</p></div>

   <div><p>I have created a patch to reduce the number of warnings down to
   three, a more reasonable number. I agree, having a kitchensink app
   with so many warnings is not very confidence-inspiring.</p></div></li>
<li>Rich Baughman 2011-04-15

   <div><p>How do we apply this patch to KS project files on Mac OS
   X/Titanium?</p></div></li>
<li>Matt Bishop 2011-04-15

   <div><p>This is assuming you have cloned the git project.</p>
   <ol>
   <li>Put the kitchensink.diff file in
   KitchenSink/KitchenSink<br></li>
   <li>git-apply --check kitchensink.diff</li>
   </ol>
   <p>If that says the patch is OK then apply it:<br>
   3. git-apply kitchensink.diff</p>
   <p>NOTE: I created a new, separate project called
   PatchedKitchenSink and copied the patched KitchenSink/Resources dir
   into it, overwriting the base Resources dir that Titanium created.
   The files around the checked-out version (like what is in build/)
   are not well.</p></div></li>
<li>Matt Bishop 2011-04-15

   <div><p>Step 1 should read:</p>
   <ol>
   <li>Put the kitchensink.diff file in KitchenSink/</li>
   </ol>
   <p>Sorry about that.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>I get the following errors. Can you just put a zip of the
   updated files up somewhere?</p>
   <pre>
   <code>$ git apply kitchensink.diff

   <div><p>And just to be verbose, here's what happens with a --check:</p>
   <pre>
   <code>
   $ git apply --check kitchensink.diff 
   error: patch failed: KitchenSink/build/iphone/Resources/.version:1
   error: KitchenSink/build/iphone/Resources/.version: patch does not apply

   error: KitchenSink/build/iphone/project.xcconfig: patch does not apply</code>
   </pre></div></li>
<li>Matt Bishop 2011-04-15

   <div><p>It may be that the current version is newer than what is in the
   patch.</p></div></li>
<li>Stephen Tramer 2011-04-15

   <div><p>Do we even care about this? Going to put in Ralf's bucket.</p></div></li>
<li>Rich Baughman 2011-04-15

   <div><p>I would like to request that, as the <em>primary</em> coding
   model and de facto Ti reference and teaching piece for all current
   and aspiring Titanium developers, Appcelerator should make it a
   priority item for improving the quality of the code and its
   embedded documentation. There is really no excuse for providing a
   reference app that generates hundreds of errors and warnings, since
   they can be avoided. Many of the examples need to be more robust,
   and the code quality is less than optimal, to say the least.
   There's little use of user-defined classes, the examples are in
   some cases overly trivial and unhelpful, there's a lot of redundant
   code with hardwired coordinates, etc. I would think that
   Appcelerator would want this to be a "best foot forward"
   advertisement for the platform, using coding best practices. It's
   been 6 months since this was raised, and I'm still getting 155
   warnings from KS in 1.6.0.</p></div></li>
<li>Sindre Sorhus 2011-04-15

    <div><p>I couldn't agree more. KitchenSink is a mess, both in structure
    and coding style.</p>
    <p>It is important. Every new user use KitchenSink as a reference.
    So you're essentially promoting bad coding style.</p></div></li>

    reassigning</li>
<li>Lee Morris 2017-04-28

    Closing ticket as invalid as this version of Kitchen Sink is no longer in use.</li>
