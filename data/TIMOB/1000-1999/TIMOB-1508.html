<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>We need to implement a remote Image cache so images aren't
unnecessarily reloaded when scrolling a TableView up/down.</p></div>

   <div><p>Nathaniel please verify this. If it was fixed with 1.5.0 please
   change the Milestone to 1.5.0 and mark resolved. Also add a test in
   bug test or explain how to test in KS.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>So the way that this works is by using Java's built-in cache
   support. This makes it difficult to test since the caching is done
   transparently. Its even more difficult because the request may
   actually be modified internally by Java before forwarded into the
   cache module. However, with a little manual work, you can verify
   the caching with wireshark. Just have wireshark capture packet data
   going out from the emulator to ensure that a request is only being
   sent once.</p>
   <p>It should also be noted that the rules for when an item may not
   be cached (see the various HTTP RFC) are quite complicated. This
   caching module errs on the side of not caching. However, generally
   speaking, if you don't have a Cache-Control header in your
   response, its probably going to be cached.</p>
   <p>This feature actually shipped in 1.5.0.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>Verified on G1/1.6 and Nexus One/2.2.1 using build #e1cb22a</p>
   <p>Used the XML RSS test, downloaded all the images then
   disconnected from the network.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>Hi Don,<br>
   I just tested this with the latest build from today on my Galaxy
   (Android 2.2). The images now show up but the table performance
   while scrolling is odd. Using the KS RSS XML example: You'll see
   the images there but when scrolling it jitter-scrolls down slowly
   and then rapidly scrolls to the end as if it's catching up to where
   it is supposed to be. Sometimes doing a slow scroll it will stay in
   place or just jump to where it should be making it look like a
   scroll didn't happen.</p>
   <p>I'm debugging an HD ticket that is having the issue as well.
   I'll get specifics from him on how his table is performing.

   <div><p>Rick. Please open a new ticket wrt to performance. This ticket
   is specifically about not re-downloading images.</p></div></li>

   I'm having this problem with 2.1.1GA and 2.2 CI. If I cache the images manually and load as a blob then it works, but if I set a remote image url for the image property on an image view it disappears and reloads every time you scroll the table.</li>

   @Michael - Please provide a complete test case that reproduces this issues with the master build.</li>
