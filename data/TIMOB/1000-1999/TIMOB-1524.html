<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>1.BaseUI&gt;animation&gt;3d transform<br>
results: about 3 seconds in, the image flashes larger than it is,
then continues the animation. Not seen in the simulator, seen on a

   <div><p>More information on this one. It's a VERY SPECIFIC race
   condition that happens between the animation subsystem and our own
   layout mechanisms. It looks like it has to do with the OS
   scheduling a relayout of the view at an odd time in between
   animation frames (later iOSes probably have different scheduling
   with animations, as evidenced by the fact that the original
   solution to this created bug <a href="/projects/32238/tickets/2348"
   title="Ticket #2348">#2348</a> - under later iOSes).</p>
   <p>Either not fixable as a result, or needs to be scheduled in the
   run loop in a different way. Either could be bad.</p></div></li>
<li>Stephen Tramer 2011-04-15

   <div><p>May never be fixed. Code would be 100% in support of legacy
   3.1.x systems (at best, 3.x) and could complicate matters for later
   devices.</p></div></li>
<li>Thomas Huelbert 2011-05-17

   changed to won't fix based on stramer comments</li>
