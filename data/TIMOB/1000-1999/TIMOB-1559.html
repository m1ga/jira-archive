   <div><p>I'm still having this issue using the latest Oct 7th 1.4.2
   build. I've also had other user comment that it's happened to him.
   Any ideas what is causing this or a work around to prevent
   this?</p></div></li>

   <div><p>This ticket is the workaround for the android os defect.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>MUCH better than crashing, but this dialog still seems to scare
   users &amp; I keep getting reports about it being a "bug". Users
   seem to view this as roughly equivalent to the app crashing.</p>
   <p>This is a fairly uncomfortable situation since it happens
   without-fail the first time the user runs the app after installing
   it (and as far as I can tell, any time you click "open" from the
   app page in the Marketplace app).</p>
   <p>Is there any harm in just making this into a toast notification
   saying that the app needs to do some initialization or something,
   and restarting automatically?</p></div></li>

   I want to ask if this message "An application restart is required" is really necessary?.
   
   Users thinks that this bug is very common but in reality it is not.
   
   We need more information about this problem to explain them that this
   
   isn't a crash system.</li>

   Have this issue in 2.0.1, except the issue is not limited to the installation success activity.</li>
<li>Ygor Lemos 2013-08-07

   This is still happening on 3.1.1.GA</li>
<li>Billy Tetrud 2013-10-10

   This is still happening on the most recent versions of titanium. Please reopen</li>
<li>Joshua Quick 2019-01-11

    This issue has been resolved in Titanium 8.0.0. Please see: [TIMOB-26075]</li>
