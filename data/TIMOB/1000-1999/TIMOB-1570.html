<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>Workaround: don't use _ as the leading character of filenames.
This appears to be an Android OS issue, not a Titanium issue. Add a
warning to builder.py if these type of directories are seen.</p></div>

   Resolving as invalid because in Titanium 3.1.1.GA, directories that start with _ are copied to the build assets folder as expected. However, there is a bug (TIMOB-1480) that is preventing files from being require()'d that are in a directory that starts with an _.</li>
