<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>The use case is you have a question that needs/allows for
multiple selected items. A good example is a poll question. Pick 3
of 15 items that are your highest priority.</p>
<p>The expected result is an array of selected indexes instead of a
single selected index.</p></div>
