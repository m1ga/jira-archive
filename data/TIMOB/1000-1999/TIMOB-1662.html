<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>I have a project in which I use Ti.include('filename.js') to
keep the app design modular. So here's the scenario.</p>
<p>app.js declares variable mySetting<br>
app.js includes file doSomethingWithSetting.js</p>
<p>The code in doSomethingWithSetting.js cannot find the variable
mySetting.</p>
<p>A Q&amp;A has also been created previously by someone else
experiencing the same problem: <a href=

   When vars are declared and files included outside of a function (or eventListener), it works as expected on Android AND iOS (see testVar1 and testVar2 in the code below). However, on Android, when vars are declared and files included *inside* a function, an exception is generated as the variables are not known. According to Don, it seems that the incorrect scope is being used.
   
   Tested on:
   Android 2.2, Titanium 1.7.0 (06/02/11 11:34 c951553...) - passes 2 out of 4 tests
   iOS 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, Titanium 1.7 latest build (June 2011) - passes 3 out of 4 tests
   
   See inline comments for pass/fails:
   
   <code><pre>
   var win1 = Titanium.UI.createWindow({
     title:'Window 1',
     backgroundColor:'blue',
     fullscreen:false
   });
   
   win1.open();
   
   var testVar1 = "succeeded";
   Ti.include('include_test1.js');
   
   Ti.API.info("testVar2 which was defined in include_test1.js and output in app.js: " + testVar2);
   
   win1.addEventListener('click', function(){
     var testVar3 = "succeeded";
     Ti.include('include_test2.js');
   
     // exception: testVar4 is not defined on Android, but **works** on iOS
     Ti.API.info("testVar4 which was defined in include_test2.js and output in app.js: " + testVar4);
   });
   </pre></code>
   
   <code><pre>
   Ti.API.info("testVar1 which was defined in app.js and output in include_test1.js: " + testVar1);
   var testVar2 = "succeeded";
   </pre></code>
   
   <code><pre>
   // exception: testVar3 is not defined on both Android and iOS
   Ti.API.info("testVar3 which was defined in app.js and output in include_test2.js: " + testVar3);  
   var testVar4 = "succeeded";
   </pre></code>

   Testing against 1.8.0 beta, it appears that the iOS behavior is more in line: testVar 4 is undefined for both platforms.

   Note, however, that things work differently if this doesn't occur inside an event handler. For example, if we include test2 inside an ordinary function:
   
   <code>
   var win1 = Titanium.UI.createWindow({
     title:'Window 1',
     backgroundColor:'blue',
     fullscreen:false
   });
   
   win1.open();
   
   var testVar1 = "succeeded";
   Ti.include('include_test1.js');
   
   Ti.API.info("testVar2 which was defined in include_test1.js and output in app.js: " + testVar2);
   
   var test = function(){
     var testVar3 = "succeeded";
     Ti.include('include_test2.js');
   
     // exception: testVar4 is not defined on Android, but **works** on iOS
     Ti.API.info("testVar4 which was defined in include_test2.js and output in app.js: " + testVar4);
   };
   
   test();
   </code>
   
   And change include_test2.js to:
   
   <code>
   var testVar4 = "succeeded";
   Ti.API.info("testVar1: " + testVar1);
   Ti.API.info("testVar2: " + testVar2);
   </code>
   
   All of the variable references work. If we add the reference to testVar3 back in, however, it breaks--testVar3 is out of scope in the include file.
   
   Conclusion: include file has access to the current root execution context. But: trying to include a file from an event handler has unpredictable results.

   <code>Ti.include()</code> has been deprecated since Titanium SDK 3.3.0 in favor of CommonJS modules and <code>require()</code>.</li>

   Closing ticket as the issue will not fix.</li>
