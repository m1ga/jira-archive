   <div><p>The docs say we support it (at least reference properties that
   are Android only): <a href=

   <div><p>There is no way currently to selectively remove common view
   properties in the documentation.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>A lot of apps are moving to the dashboard navigation paradigm.
   This is something we really need for android. Can we include this
   in 1.6?</p></div></li>
<li>Andre Carregal 2011-04-15

   <div><p>Any plans for an Android dashboard component?</p></div></li>

   Bump. This is something NEEDED on a whole bunch of apps. Not having it on Android is a pretty bad thing.</li>

   I looked into this recently.  It looks like the only code available to possibly base an implementation on is the Android home screen itself.
   
   For those of you in need of this control on Android, would something like the Android home screen fit your needs?  Or, do you need *precisely* the same functionality as exists on iOS?</li>
<li>Juan G. Hurtado 2012-06-07

   I think it would be easier to use if the behavior is the same across platforms. Think about how Android's dashboard implements the "remove icon" stuff, loading a bottom "drop zone" to trash the icons. That could collide with app's UI in some cases.</li>

    Bump. Any news on this?</li>

    I ended up just writing a grid view in javascript that will do what I need.  The Android home screen would be pretty hard to port since it's got a ton of resources (which can't be bundled with a module project) and it uses a bunch of renderscript stuff.  Also, it's made to have a fixed number of pages.
    
    Additionally, the Android UI isn't fast enough without hardware acceleration for this UI to look smooth (particularly, following touchmove events with an icon when it's been 'picked up').  Therefore, OpenGL/Renderscript would have to be used to achieve a smooth ui, which makes this non trivial to implement in either native code or JS.</li>
