<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>This has been a thorn in the side for many (myself included) for
awhile: See <a href=
"<a href="http://developer.appcelerator.com/questions/search/button%20backgroundcolor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://developer.appcelerator.com/questions/search/button%20backgroundcolor</a>">
<a href="http://developer.appcelerator.com/questions/search/button%20backgro..." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://developer.appcelerator.com/questions/search/button%20backgro...</a></a></p>
<p>Here's a testcase to reproduce. It doesn't work both if the
button is on the navBar and if it is just in the window. In the
window..the color is set on the edges around the button (which is
not what 99.9% of people want I'd think :)</p>
<pre>
<code class="javascript">var win = Ti.UI.currentWindow;

var btn1 = Titanium.UI.createButton({
    title:"Test",
    backgroundColor:'#0d8d00',
    width:70,
});
win.rightNavButton = btn1;

var btn2 = Titanium.UI.createButton({
    title:"Test",
    backgroundColor:'#0d8d00',
    width:70,
    height:120
});
win.add(btn2);</code>
</pre>
<p>Blain: I'm not sure of the ticket triage procedure at
Appcelerator, so I assigned it to you as it is an iphone related
bug. If this isn't right, sorry about that. (I just didn't want it
to langish around.)</p></div>

   <div><p>Oh, one more thing. This was tested with 1.4.0, and with the
   9/2/2010 nightly.</p></div></li>
<li>Robby 2011-04-15

   <div><p>And setting backgroundImage: 'none' fixed the main window
   button, but not the navbar button. In any case, it's a hack. :)</p></div></li>
<li>Stephen Tramer 2011-04-15

   <div><p>Ticket is still valid. Test in bugtests.</p></div></li>
<li>Brian 2011-04-15

   <div><p>Seriously. How has this not been fixed yet? It still doesn't
   work in 1.6 or the latest nightly 1.6.1</p></div></li>
<li>Norm 2011-04-15

   <div><p>Bump for this also - rather silly this doesn't just "work" -
   rather core to the way buttons behave.</p></div></li>
<li>Blain Hamon 2011-04-15

   <div><p>Trying to clarify here: do you mean a rounded rectangle button,
   and how background color defines the corners behind the rounded
   rectangle, and not the rectangle itself? If so, that actually is
   Apple's design. Included (And hopefully Lighthouse will actually
   keep it) is an example outside of Titanium, in Apple's own
   Interface Builder.</p>
   <p>In order to have a custom look to a button, you'll have to use a
   background image. Take a look at the button example in Kitchen
   Sink, namely the section that goes
   <code>Titanium.UI.createButton({backgroundImage:'../images/BUTT_grn_off.png',
   backgroundSelectedImage:'../images/BUTT_grn_on.png',
   backgroundDisabledImage: '../images/BUTT_drk_off.png'})</code>
   .</p>
   <p>With regards to the nav bar, the class behind that (when no
   custom background image is used) is UIBarButtonItem. As per
   <a href="<a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIBarButtonItem_Class/Reference/Reference.html%23//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40007519" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIBarButtonItem_Class/Reference/Reference.html%23//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40007519</a>">
   <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/UIKit/Referen..." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/UIKit/Referen...</a></a>
   , there's only three styles for a barButtonItem:</p>
   <p>Plain: In the nav bar, this is treated as bordered.<br>
   Bordered: The background color is determined by the tint of the
   navbar containing it. This is not editable.<br>
   Done: The background color is blue, like a Done button. This color
   is not editable.</p>
   <p>Again, for a custom button style, use a backgroundImage.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>Marking as invalid. Blain has explained how to the client can
   implement custom button UI.</p></div></li>
<li>dit k 2011-12-06

   setting Image, color etc.. is very buggy and still not fixed :(</li>
