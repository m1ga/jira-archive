   [<a href="/projects/32238/tickets/1733" title=
   "Ticket #1733">#1733</a> state:fixed-in-qa] moved up creation of
   VideoView and if play : true is passed as a creation arguement kick
   of a high priority background thread to start trying to stream.
   Tested on droid, n1, eris, and emulator and didn't run into any
   issues. <a href=

   <div><p>g1 1.6, seemed to load pretty quickly over wifi</p></div></li>

   <div><p>It's fast over WiFi, but over 3G it's still too slow (around
   10-20 seconds to start).<br>
   It seems to buffer like almost 50% of the video before starting to
   play. So the "start trying to stream" is happening fast now, but
   the kick off for "start trying to play it" is at fault.</p>
   <p>The other issue is that it's not only slow, the user hasn't a
   way to know that a video is loading (no indicator) so it looks like
   its frozen. (Should I open another ticket about this?)</p></div></li>
<li>Don Thorp 2011-04-15

   <div><p>The SDK does not provide buffering control at this time. I'm not
   even sure we get a notification as to when it starts loading. I
   added <a href="/projects/32238/tickets/1853" title=
