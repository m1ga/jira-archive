<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>The following test cases require the user to tap the screen
before the focus rect appears by way of the trackball. In some
cases, if I use a tap to get to the test, the track ball works, but
if I use the trackball to to make the selection, the resulting test
wil not show the focus rect.</p>
<p>so,<br>
trackball to make selection in list&gt;trackball fails in test<br>
finger tap in list&gt;trackball works. That make any sense? :-P</p>

   [<a href="/projects/32238/tickets/1748" title=
   "Ticket #1748">#1748</a> state:fixed-in-qa] Code cleanup to not
   request getLayout() more than once. Fixed trackball focus. Since
   Android has the concept of touchable focus, your action on a
   preceding window in KS has an effect on the next window. For
   example, if you touch select a test, trackball focus will work on
   the next window. This seemed to be working before. If you
   trackball/dpad select, then it failed to let you use the
   trackball/dpad on the next activity. After the fix you should
   notice distinct behaviors. If you touch select and go to the next
   test, you will not see a focused item in most cases. If you
   trackball/dpad select then you will see a control with focus on the
   next Activity. <a href=

   <div><p>These still fail (in that trackball does not give focus, wether
   its touch or trackball that invokes the window):</p>
