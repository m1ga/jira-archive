<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>Hello,</p>
<p>I'm using the childNodes property for iPhone and Android. On
iPhone, it works fine and return the children nodes correctly. But,
on Android, it returns something very strange. According DOMNode
documentation to childNodes property: "Returns a DOMNodeList that
contains all children of this node. If there are no children, this
is an empty DOMNodeList". You can see the Ti.DOMNodeList object for
both (android and iPhone) but if you call childNodes.length on
Android it returns a "magic" number different of the real number of
childrens that is returned properly on iPhone. In other words, on
iPhone is everything fine, on Android the childNodes property
doesn't works properly.</p>
<p>Regards.</p></div>

   <div><p>Gilliard, is this simply because on Android the parsed DOM tree
   includes whitespace which appears to be stripped out by the parsing
   on iPhone?</p>
   <p>Please go ahead and iterate over the nodes and check what they
   are. You should find the same element nodes on both systems.
   (childNodes <em>DOES NOT</em> only include elements! It also
   includes text nodes, comment nodes, etc.)</p></div></li>

   It appears that it was a whitespace issue and not a platform issue. Please reopen this ticket if you can provide a test case or better description to reproduce this issue.</li>
