<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>On iOS 4, if internet connectivity is disabled and the app is
opened and closed repeatedly quickly, the app becomes unresponsive.
KS was used as the test app, Titanium SDK 1.4.0 and 1.4.1
builds.</p>
<p>As a note: I was able to do this same thing with non titanium
apps as well so it <em>could be</em> an iOS issue.</p></div>

   <div><p>Possibly a dupe of <a href="/projects/32238/tickets/2628" title=

   <div><p>OK, going to mark this fixed-in-qa. Can't reproduce and Clint
   has said that it may have been fixed by an earlier analytics bug.
   However when testing this I discovered a new analytics crash.</p>
   <p><a href="/projects/32238/tickets/2628" title=
   "Ticket #2628">#2628</a> appears to be different.</p></div></li>
