   Now that iOS has widgets and are gaining lots of traction....it would be really nice to finally bring parity here.  Any chance we can bring this back to the top for consideration?</li>
<li>Shawn Lipscomb 2020-09-29

   I'll second that request.  I have an app that needs a home screen widget badly.  Both for Android and iOS.</li>
<li>Michael Gangolf 2020-09-29

   you can do that with a module: 
   !<a href="http://migaweb.de/Screenshot_20200930_001721.png" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://migaweb.de/Screenshot_20200930_001721.png</a>!
   I just followed this tutorial: <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/create-simple-android-widget-608975/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.androidauthority.com/create-simple-android-widget-608975/</a>
   
   [Video example](<a href="http://migaweb.de/ti_widget.mp4)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://migaweb.de/ti_widget.mp4)</a>
   
   You just require the module and it works. I think the iOS part is a module too. So there is already parity for this :)
   
   BTW: I've tried it with hyperloop first. The whole XML part works (even without HL) but I wasn't able to make the AppWidgetProvider connection. So the module was a lot faster</li>

   @Michael Gangolf, that's great, but I'm not a Java develoer...I'm a Titanium developer.  So we're looking for cross-platform support for widgets in Titanium.
   
   Now if someone wants to write and publish generic modules for Android and iOS that support any view as a widget, that'd be fantastic.</li>
<li>Michael Gangolf 2020-09-30

    [~bitshftr] of course I would like to have that in javascript, too! But at the moment this is like other framework handle this too (e.g. [react native](<a href="https://medium.com/better-programming/react-native-how-to-build-a-home-screen-widget-for-ios-and-android-8b2d7db343cb))." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://medium.com/better-programming/react-native-how-to-build-a-home-screen-widget-for-ios-and-android-8b2d7db343cb)).</a> I'll try to see if there is a possibility to create a more generic plugin for Android.
    
    BTW: I'm not a native developer and it was my first widget where I just copied to code from the tutorial (as you can see just intents) and the Layout part can be done using the WYSIWYG editor :) There is currently no connection between the app and the widget.</li>

    @Shawn: That's very very impolite to ask for. First, if you are a Titanium developer and are not willing to extend your skills, you should hire someone to help you fill your knowledge gaps instead of pushing for a technology update that you likely don't even pay for and/or contribute to. Second, technically, iOS and Android widgets work completely different. Both in the configuration, activation and even the data consumption. So if you're not even willing to use provided copy paste code and spend some hours to personalize it for your use case, these new technologies are likely not meant to be used by you.</li>
<li>Shawn Lipscomb 2020-09-30

    @Hans, I was not being impolite. I know there are developers out there who are looking for opportunities to write modules that can be used by Titanium developers.  I would even pay a reasonable amount for such a module (not the development of one, but rather as one of many users).  My apps are free so there's no chance of hiring someone.
    
    As far as "pushing for a technology update", I think that Appcelerator needs some pushing to catch up.  Titanium is presented as a cross-platform mobile app rapid application development language.  It should support all of the features of both Android and iOS devices out of the box.  Yet there are many common mobile app features that Titanium lacks and/or has abandonned (e.g. in-app purchases).  IMO, they wasted a lot of time on Blackberry and then Windows Phone support, when it was clear that those were fringe devices.  That time could have been better spent making Titanium better for Android and iOS devices.  Other cross-platform languages, like Delphi and Xamarin, are eating Titanium's lunch.
    
    I take offense to your statement about "not willing to extend your skills", as you know nothing about me.  I program in several languages and use several technologies, and I have a high-level full-time job that requires that I prioritize my time for the maximum benefit of my company's profits.  It's a simple cost-benefit analysis -- one that easily tells me that my limited time is best spent on things other than Java for an Android module, and then something entirely different for iOS, that I would use exactly once.
    
    As you stated, "iOS and Android widgets work completely different(ly)".  That's why we need Titanium to present us with a cross-platform object...a Ti.Widget if you will.  So that Titanium projects can make a widget without worrying with the individual OS implementation details.  Conceptually this is no different than a Titanium button.
    
    The Java code posted by Michael doesn't address iOS at all, so I can't just "copy paste code".
    
    This Jira entry is a feature request, which is exactly what we're doing...requesting a feautre be added to Titanium.</li>
