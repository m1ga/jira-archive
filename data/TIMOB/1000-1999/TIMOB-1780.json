Second, technically, iOS and Android widgets work completely different. Both in the configuration, activation and even the data consumption.

					"body": "@Hans, I was not being impolite. I know there are developers out there who are looking for opportunities to write modules that can be used by Titanium developers.  I would even pay a reasonable amount for such a module (not the development of one, but rather as one of many users).  My apps are free so there's no chance of hiring someone.\r\n\r\nAs far as \"pushing for a technology update\", I think that Appcelerator needs some pushing to catch up.  Titanium is presented as a cross-platform mobile app rapid application development language.  It should support all of the features of both Android and iOS devices out of the box.  Yet there are many common mobile app features that Titanium lacks and/or has abandonned (e.g. in-app purchases).  IMO, they wasted a lot of time on Blackberry and then Windows Phone support, when it was clear that those were fringe devices.  That time could have been better spent making Titanium better for Android and iOS devices.  Other cross-platform languages, like Delphi and Xamarin, are eating Titanium's lunch.\r\n\r\nI take offense to your statement about \"not willing to extend your skills\", as you know nothing about me.  I program in several languages and use several technologies, and I have a high-level full-time job that requires that I prioritize my time for the maximum benefit of my company's profits.  It's a simple cost-benefit analysis -- one that easily tells me that my limited time is best spent on things other than Java for an Android module, and then something entirely different for iOS, that I would use exactly once.\r\n\r\nAs you stated, \"iOS and Android widgets work completely different(ly)\".  That's why we need Titanium to present us with a cross-platform object...a Ti.Widget if you will.  So that Titanium projects can make a widget without worrying with the individual OS implementation details.  Conceptually this is no different than a Titanium button.\r\n\r\nThe Java code posted by Michael doesn't address iOS at all, so I can't just \"copy paste code\".\r\n\r\nThis Jira entry is a feature request, which is exactly what we're doing...requesting a feautre be added to Titanium.",
