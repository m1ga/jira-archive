<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>Have tried to email this twice (replying to diff issues
earlier), and use previous helpdesk links (which now just seem to
go to get_help - what system shold I be using for my premium
support???)</p>
<p>Have downloaded continuous build of 1.4.1 (as suggested by Bill
to resolve an Android issue) now titanium has lost all my apps,
I've tried importing them again but they won't build/run the
simulator or on the device (even tried creating new project and
copying the resource folder across) - no errors, just stops with
the following...<br>
<a href="/projects/32238/changesets/INFO" title=
"Changeset [INFO]">[INFO]</a> One moment, building ... <a href=
"/projects/32238/changesets/INFO" title=
"Changeset [INFO]">[INFO]</a> Titanium SDK version: cont-1.4.1
<a href="/projects/32238/changesets/INFO" title=
"Changeset [INFO]">[INFO]</a> iPhone Device family: ipad <a href=
"/projects/32238/changesets/INFO" title=
"Changeset [INFO]">[INFO]</a> iPhone SDK version: 3.2</p>
<p>If I try to go back to 1.4.0 in the edit tab the sdk box on Test
page just gets "loading..." (had this problem before) - tried
removing the cont-1.4.1 directory and restarting, but makes no
difference</p>
<p>Help (first sent this in on 13th - was urgent then as can't
develop anything!) - have assigned to Nolan simply as he helped
with the last time something similar happened - not sure this is
the right place to raise this, but am desperate!</p></div>
