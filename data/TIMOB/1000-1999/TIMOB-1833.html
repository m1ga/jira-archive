<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>On both the iPhone and iPad, right before the apps initial
window is shown, the splash screen image jumps up the height of the
status bar. I found a work around to increase the size of the image
to the full size of the device screens and the jump goes away. The
KS shows this on both.</p></div>

   <div><p>Actually I tried to have an hi-res image full size and with 40px
   less but still the image is jumping.</p>
   <p>Doesn't happen if splash image is lo-res 320x480</p></div></li>

   <div><p>I also have this problem.</p>
   <p>It's an issue for anyone who follows Apple's human interface
   guidelines and tries to display a picture of their app UI instead
   of having a full-screen commercial splash screen with the status
   bar hidden.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>if not completely wrong I resolved making sure to have two
   different img for the retina display and not...</p></div></li>

   <div><p>Just use one image for retina and one for older devices display.
   It is the Apple HIG recommendation and standard way to do it.
   Titanium will properly setup your @2x image when compiling the
   app.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>D'oh. Forgot to update this bug. This has been since fixed, but
   under bug <a href="/projects/32238/tickets/2633" title=
   "Ticket #2633">#2633</a>. Since that has the commit history, let's
   mark this one duplicate.</p></div></li>

   Closing issue due to time passed and irrelevance of the ticket.</li>
