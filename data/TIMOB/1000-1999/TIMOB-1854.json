The\nversion that runs in the simulator loads app.js by using a relative\npath that goes outside of the actual application and it runs.\nHowever a compiled application for the device has the images and\nother resources but not app.js. I set a breakpoint in\nKrollBridge.mm / didStartNewContext around line 482 and noted that\nstartURL is expecting that app.js is in the apps folder but the\nfile is missing. The XCode project does not have app.js listed as a\nresource of the target either.<br></p>\n<p>I do have a crash log if you need one.</p></div>{html}",

This recompile is known as TiJSCore v8.\nHowever, because the newer mmap functions, despite having the same\nargs, doesn't allow for readwrite and execute on the same memory\npage in iOS 4.0.2 and later, v8 would crash on newer OSes. More\nspecifically, the OS would force the app to quit as a security\nmeasure. I never saw this because, when running from\nxCode/debugging, the debugger overrides this security, so it'd run\nfine for me.</p>\n<p>Since then, I reverted back to v7, so we have scary but harmless\nwarnings again, but the code works. HOWEVER, the way scons works is\nto see that the library had been downloaded in the past. Since it\nsees 7.txt, it won't replace v8 with v7.</p>\n<p>Since 1.4.1.1 was based on 1.4.0 with changes into the python\nused by Titanium Developer, and not the runtime, 1.4.1.1 was\nblissfully unaware and unaffected by this issue.</p></div>{html}",
