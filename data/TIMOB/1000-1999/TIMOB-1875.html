<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>4th gen iPod (4.1) with mobile sdk build 1.4.2.dc7b90</p>
<p>this is a little tricky to reproduce. if you don't see it right
away, try tapping an object a few times, then tap another
object</p>
<p>1.BaseUI&gt;Views&gt;Event Propagation<br>
2.tap the objects and look at the bottom right of the screen</p>
<p>results:labels appear on the bottom right then are drawn in the
correct location.</p></div>

   <div><p>Unable to reproduce in 1.5.0.aa98ab, but do occasionally see an
   empty window pop up with no text. Probably due to the fact that the
   value for messageLabel.text is being reset (and potentially
   released) many times over with fast clicking.</p>
   <p>Thom, can you confirm that this no longer appears, and/or the
   empty windows? Not sure what we can do about the latter.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>Ok - got better repro steps (and I made Blain watch it happen
   :-P)</p>
   <p>1.BaseUI&gt;Views&gt;Event Propagation<br>
   2.tap D and wait until for the label to appear then disappear.<br>
   3.tap it again</p>
   <p>this reliably shows the "misplaced" label issue on the 4th and
   3rd gen ipod touches running 4.1 and 4.0.2 respectively.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>this should have gone back to STephen, d'oh.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>May be fixed by a layout refactor</p></div></li>
<li>Stephen Tramer 2011-04-15

   <div><p>Unable to reproduce, after following the listed steps, after the
   layout refactor was merged in.</p></div></li>
