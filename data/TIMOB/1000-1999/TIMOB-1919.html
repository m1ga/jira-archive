<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>Right now Ti.Network.registerForPushNotifications only works
with iPhone.</p>
<p>Android 2.2 (Froyo) just added push notifications, called C2DM:

Problem is this only works with v2.2 devices and up.</p>
<p>Urban Airship has an approach that works with almost all android
devices...but I'm not sure how much you want to marry to them:<br>

<p>In any case, some kind of built-in support for push on Android
would be great.</p></div>

   <div><p>Don, I have an Android push module written and lightly tested
   and would be willing to give you guys the code if that'd help you
   create an officially-supported module quicker; let me know if
   you're interested.</p></div></li>
<li>Don Thorp 2011-04-15

   <div><p>@Matthew I think there is going to be a module in the
   marketplace for Urban Airship. We have enough features left for 1.5
   that I don't think we're going to get any more modules done before
   Q1. Would you have any interest in adding yours to the market when
   it ships?</p></div></li>
<li>Matthew Lieder 2011-04-15

   <div><p>Possibly; we don't have resources to support it beyond our needs
   though so someone else will likely need to take over support for
   it.</p></div></li>
<li>Anthony Webb 2011-04-15

   <div><p>@matt, I'd be interested in taking over support for it if you
   guys will post it. Most of my upcoming projects require C2DM, and
   installing a 3rd party app like urban airship isnt kosher with my
   clients.</p></div></li>
<li>Matthew Lieder 2011-04-15

   <div><p>Would it be acceptable if I released the code under LGPL?</p></div></li>
<li>Chris Nelson 2011-04-15

   <div><p>Please do! :)</p>
   <p>My application that I'd like to implement will involve a heavy
   use of push notifications, so I could get a good amount of testing
   done for anyone interested.</p></div></li>
<li>Peter Sweeney 2011-04-15

   <div><p>I'm really interested in this. Can you explain please how you're
   doing a push in this instance, as the application would surely have
   to be inactive - so is the push a secondary application running in
   the background, low memory footprint? Can you explain further
   please. Is it true push?</p></div></li>
<li>Matthew Lieder 2011-04-15

   <div><p>Chris: I'm going to try to get the code out soon; sometime
   between tomorrow and the end of the month :p</p>

   <div><p>Matthew, do you have twitter or somewhere I can follow the
   progress?</p></div></li>

    <div><p>How about GitHub? :)</p>

    <p>I haven't done any development on it for a few weeks so it may
    be broken with the latest 1.5.0 build, but changes should be minor.
    You'll definitely want to update build.properties to the paths in
    your local environment though. Feel free to change the package name
    from com.findlaw.titanium.c2dm to something else. Instructions on
    how to build and test the module can be found here: <a href=

    <div><p>Looks good! I'll see what I can do about implementing this
    sometime this week and give you some feedback. Thanks for your
    contribution!</p></div></li>
<li>chrisbratlien 2011-04-15

    <div><p>Looking forward to using C2DM in Titanium in current and future
    apps.</p>
    <p>Attempting to build this module. I've changed build.properties
    to reflect my environment. When I try to build with ant, or with
    Eclipse, I get the following error:</p>
    <p>/Library/Application
    Support/Titanium/mobilesdk/osx/1.5.0/module/android/build.xml:10:
    java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: Bad version number in
    .class file</p>
    <p>Maybe something to do with Java version?</p>
    <p>$ javac -version javac 1.6.0_22<br>
    $ java -version java version "1.6.0_22"<br>
    Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_22-b04-307-9M3263)<br>
    Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 17.1-b03-307, mixed
    mode)</p>
    <p>Eclipse is set to use 1.5</p>
    <p>Line 10 of that build.xml is:</p>
    <pre>
    <code>&lt;taskdef classname="org.appcelerator.titanium.ant.StringTask" name="ti.string" classpath="${ti.module.support.dir}/android/ant-tasks.jar"/&gt;</code>
    </pre>
    <p>Does anyone have a pre-built zip of this module (if that would
    help), or any suggestions?</p></div></li>
<li>chrisbratlien 2011-04-15

    <div><p>Just a follow up. I'm now able to build titanium-c2dm in Eclipse
    if I tell Eclipse to use Java 1.6</p></div></li>

    Our push notification support is specific to ACS module and not generic.</li>
<li>Shawn Lipscomb 2012-06-29

    Android C2DM has just been deprecated in favor of the new "Google Cloud Messaging" ([<a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=2663268" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=2663268</a>]).  Please add support for "Google Cloud Messaging".</li>
<li>Muhammad Adnan 2012-10-23

    Push Notifications using C2DM are deprecated now, GCM is used now a days for this Purpose

    Resolving as a duplicate of the linked issue and module</li>
<li>Neville Dastur 2013-08-10

    Ingo, I think this should be re-opened. It is great having modules on GitHub but this is such a core feature of apps and has been supported for ages on iOS. I think this is an important parity issue and really should be "built into" appcelerator without the need for a separate module build process</li>
<li>Ingo Muschenetz 2013-10-29

    [~ndastur] Our ti.cloudpush module (delivered with the SDK) supports GCM. Is there an issue with using that approach?</li>
<li>Neville Dastur 2013-10-29

    @Ingo. It looks to me that the ti.cloudpush methods only support push notifications via ACS which is obviously quite vendor specific. If that is not the case then can the docs be updated.
    
    Thanks</li>
