   <div><p>Works for me on both iPhone 2G (3.1.x) and iPod Touch 3G (4.1).
   The issue may be that accelerometers in more recent devices may be
   more precise than the original calibration values for 'shake'
   (which appear to be for 2G devices). Had to give the iPod a pretty
   good shake, but the iPhone took a love tap.</p>
   <p>We really need a "works-for-me" setting in Lighthouse. Marking
   this invalid for now.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>must be device specific - I can get the 3rd gen ipod to work,
   and the iphone 3g I have, but no matter how much I wail on the 4th
   gen ipod, no alert appears. As this is device specific and we have
   a a 4th gen ipod at the mothership, switching to Blain as
   assigned.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>Worth mentioning that there's a strong possibility this is an
   Apple bug - we're just trapping an iOS/device-generated event and
   using it to send our own notification.</p></div></li>
<li>Blain Hamon 2011-04-15

   <div><p>So wait, the MV office is the mothership? I thought that was
   reserved for talking about Apple.</p>
   <p>It could be an apple bug, or it could be a case of gaining
   focus. I recall that a view has to have focus in order to receive
   the shake event.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>Hunh. Turns out the bug's always been there, but it's subtle.
   The first shake that is listened for will fire correctly always,
   but after that, a shake event will be fired only if it was within 1
   second of a previous shake. So testing with shaking fast would get
   the event (for all but the first shake in a group), but a proper
   single shake would not fire.</p>
   <p>Removing the regression tag, but checking in a fix.</p>
   <p>Note that issue 2048 still is unfixed, so that all testing has
   to be done on the first time the shake window is opened (until 2048
   is fixed), as later window openings will exhibit 2048's symptoms,
   and block the fix from working properly.</p></div></li>
