<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>iPod (4.1) with mobile sdk build 1.4.2.e6bd67</p>
<p>1.Phone&gt;Sound&gt;Local (or any of the first 3)<br>
2.tap and watch the as the window animates out, when the new window
draws in</p>
<p>results: the animation is still occuring when the new window
draws in, there is a brief period where both windows appear (though
only in a small part of the left side of the screen - unable to
grab a screenshot during the short period it happens).</p>
<p>seen in 1.4.0</p></div>

   Still valid SDK 2.2.0.014b86f. The behavior seen is that the new window draws over the old window while it's animating out; you may need to go back and forth between Phone>Sound and Phone>Sound>Local via the navigation bar a couple of times to see this.</li>

   Closing ticket as Invalid as this version of Kitchen Sink is no longer supported.</li>
