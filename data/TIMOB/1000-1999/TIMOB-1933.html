<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>The app I'm trying develop is for a collection of hiking and
biking trails. Each trail may have multiple offshoots or different
surface types (which would require a different route color), but
currently adding multiple routes to the same mapview only shows the
one. Couldn't there be an addRoutes like the working
addAnnotations? I have tried loading the route as part of SQLite
return while and as part of an array, but neither work.</p></div>

   This appears to work on iOS in 1.8.1. 
   
   Android does not support addRoute yet. See linked bug.</li>

   For parity, Android should support multiple routes when it supports addRoute.</li>
