   <div><p>Strongly recommending that the engineering team discuss this
   behavior. There is a major problem with resolving this bug, namely
   that we need to make sure that behavior is consistent across both
   iPhone and Android platforms when dealing with event listeners at
   the module level.</p>
   <p>Secondly, we will need to retain any possible contexts which
   involve event listeners, and listeners will affect ONLY those
   contexts, i.e. they may not work as expected for variables with the
   same name across contexts. Resolving this issue could take major
   changes to how Kroll callbacks work within Titanium and will
   require that some critical resources are never released (contexts
   for closed pages).</p>
   <p>Going to mark needs-more-info and begin discussion with
   engineering.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>Two separate things here:</p>
   <ol>
   <li>What appears to be at least part of the bug described in the HD
   ticket has been confirmed as fixed. Closing a context which
   originally contained a gesture listener, then adding a new gesture
   listener in a different context, works as expected. This is bug
   <a href="/projects/32238/tickets/2048" title=
   "Ticket #2048">#2048</a>. I have independently confirmed that the
   sample code provided by the customer is functional off of the
   latest master/HEAD.<br></li>
   <li>The issue described above, handling when module event listeners
   can be added and how long they should be expected to persist, has
   been agreed upon by engineering to have the correct behavior at
   present.</li>
   </ol>
   <p>Marking this ticket resolved as a result.</p></div></li>
