   <div><p>This is also occuring in the continuous 1.4.2 build on Oct 5
   2010 09:50 r3f1d49ee</p></div></li>

   <div><p>Yup. Getting this too in the latest build.</p>
   <p>Is this worrying? ie: Is this anything that would prevent an app
   submission?</p></div></li>

   <div><p>Caused by using wrong version of TiCore.</p></div></li>

   <div><ul>
   <li>Caused by using wrong version of TiCore*</li>
   </ul>
   <p>Can you explain what that means? Is it something I did
   wrong?</p></div></li>
