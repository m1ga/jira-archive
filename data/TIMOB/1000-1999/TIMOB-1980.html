<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>Created an android SDK module using the titanium.py create
command. Had to create the module under MacOS b/c I got an python
exception under win32 creating it (will make a ticket for that most
likely as well...something about %1 not being valid on a process
fork operation). I then went into .classpath and build.properties
of the module and changed the paths over to the equivalent win32
paths.</p>
<p>I then put ant on my win32 box, cd'ed over to the module's
directory, and built it. titanium.py creates a build.xml file with
a line like:<br></p>
<pre>
<code>&lt;pathelement path="${android.platform}/android.jar" /&gt;</code>
</pre>
<p>However, build.properties set android.platform to the base
android SDK directory, something like:<br></p>
<pre>
<code>android.platform = C:\progra~1\android-sdk-windows</code>
</pre>
<p>Thus the build fails as the android.jar file is not in that base
directory. Are we supposed to copy it there manually, or is this a
bug? What .jar should we use, the newest one for Froyo (android-8)?
Or, should the script automatically find the newest one and adjust
the default build dir to something like:</p>
<pre>
<code>android.platform = C:\\progra~1\\android-sdk-windows\\platforms\\android-8</code>
</pre>
<p>The IOS module SDK dev guide PDF is real nice and covered a lot
of my questions about module development, but obviously doesn't
cover the android module building and the differences between the
two.</p></div>

   <div><p>Robby,</p>
   <p>The ticket system is for confirmed bugs, please use the Q&amp;A
   or Helpdesk for determining if we need to add a LH Ticket. You'll
   also want to get onto IRC during irc.freenode.net #titanium_dev
   that's where we discuss SDK issues.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>No followup on this in the ticket, Don's comment indicates that
   it should be marked invalid (HD request, not bug).</p></div></li>
