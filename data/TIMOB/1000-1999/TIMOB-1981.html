<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am using the latest build from Oct 1 2010 10:34 r763b1ded and
found out that disable autocapitalization does not work. Neither on
URL-Keyboard nor on Default-Keyboard. It does not work even in
latest KitchenSink.</p>
<p>I attached an example which demonstrates this. It includes 5
different text fields. 2 url keyboard fields and 3 default keyboard
fields. They all set autocapitalization in different ways (as a
param on creation or later dynamically).</p>
<p>I am using Titanium Developer 1.2.1, Mac OS X 10.6.2, Xcode
3.2.4, iPhone SDK 4.1.</p>
<p>This is a real showstopper cause the end-user will have trouble
to enter their url's and usernames. I already got some feedback
from end-users about concern. Many users think the app doesn't work
but it's just the enabled autocapitalization which changes their
username and url.</p>
<p>@jhaynie Would be great if you or somebody else could have a
look at this before 1.5 will be released.</p>
<p>Greetings</p></div>

   <div><p>Should autocapitalization = NONE also disable
   autocomplete/suggestion/T9? Or is it possible to disable this
   separately? Did not find something in the sources.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>Damn, found that therefore is a special autocorrect property.
   Sorry for this invalid ticket. Please close as invalid.</p></div></li>
