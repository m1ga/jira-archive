<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>Just picked the Tmobile/HTC G2 (2.2) up today and find the
Titanium app I'm working on crashes on this phone when i select any
item from a table view, this is setup like the general Kitchen Sink
navigation, calling other .js files.</p>
<p>I then installed Kitchen Sink on the device and am finding the
same results, none of the table views are browsable, all crashed
the app when any item is selected. Switching between tabs is fine,
though it crashes if anything is selected from the table view in
the tab.</p>
<p>"The application Kitchen Sink(process
com.appcelerator.kitchensink)has stopped unexpectedly. Please try
again."</p>
<p>Also to note, both my app and the Kitchen Sink install and work
fine on a Verizon Droid with 2.2 that I have here and also run fine
in the 2.2 API Emulator.</p>
<p>I'm Using Titanium SDK 1.4.1.1 on mac snow leopard 10.6.4</p>
<p>The info from the g2:</p>
<p>Android Version:<br>
2.2</p>
<p>Kernel Version:<br>
2.6.32.17-g814e0a1<br>
htc-kernal@and18-2 <a href="/projects/32238/tickets/1" title=
"Ticket #1">#1</a></p>
<p>Build Number:<br>
1.19.531.1 CL255798 release-keys</p>
<p>Sorry I don't have more technical detail, new to Titanium, but
please let me know if there anything I can check more closely.</p></div>

   <div><p>Also tried Installing Kitchen Sink onto the phone from Titanium
   SDK 1.4 on a Vista PC, confirmed same behavior.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>I don't have a G2 yet, but I hope to get one tomorrow. In
   general, it's best to bring these issues through support first. I
   just happened to be browsing tickets today and saw this. You might
   try a newer Continuous Integration build to see if the same error
   occurs, document is in the Program Guides section of the developer
   website.</p>
   <p>fwiw, 1.4.1.1 is the same as 1.4.0 as far as Android is
   concerned. It includes none of the fixes we've made since 1.4.0. It
   be a big help if you could try the CI build and let us know if it
   still occurs.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>Don,</p>
   <p>Sure, I'll try to get the CI build going first thing tomorrow
   and I'll let you know what I find. The "support first" route is
   also noted for next time/issue. This one just seemed critical
   enough that I thought the dev community might want a heads up on
   these findings with this new and high profile Android device,
   although do I understand your point on going through support first
   and I'll be sure to take that route next time should I encounter
   any additional issues with Titanium.</p>
   <p>Thanks for picking this one up!:)</p></div></li>

   <div><p>Ok, just couldn't go to bed untill I gave it a swing...</p>
   <p>mobilesdk-1.4.2-20101005192627-osx.zip does in fact seem to
   resolve this issue for the G2!</p></div></li>
<li>Don Thorp 2011-04-15

   <div><p>Great I'm going to close this as resolved. I verified it on my
   G2 as well.</p></div></li>
