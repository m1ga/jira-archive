<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>iPod (4.1) with mobile sdk build 1.4.2.4c5cd4a</p>
<p>1.Sound&gt;Audio Session Mode<br>
2.Tap "play streaming audio" (by default you should be in ambient,
but also saw it in Playback Mode as well. There behavior is
somewhat intermittant)<br>
3.Tap the back button "Sound"<br>
4.Sound&gt;Background Audio<br>
5.tap start button<br>
6.press home button once<br>
7.double click home button, swipe left to show sound controls
(bottom task bar for lack of the correct term), note appearance of
play button, try to pause sound</p>
<p>results: sound is unaffected by controls. You need to quit the
app at this point to get it to work correctly</p></div>

   This ticket is invalid because the controls on the springboard/task bar are intended to only affect the system audio player (iPod). The audio being played by streamers, etc. in Kitchen Sink do not use this audio player and so are unaffected by these controls.</li>
