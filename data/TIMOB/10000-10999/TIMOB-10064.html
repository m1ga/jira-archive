<h3>Description</h3>

This is not a regression.

Steps to Reproduce:
Make sure the desktop or laptops used for testing are on staging.
1. Make a default app in the studio.
2. Copy the app.js file from analytics app from 'mobile test internal' which we can get from git-hub to the resources folder of the newly created app.
3. Replace it with the already present app.js file.
4. Publish it for mobile web.
5. Sign in to your right scale account.
6. Click on 'APPC:UAT'.
7. Click on the small monitor icon against 'Net 1-Staging' in rightscale.
8. It will open up a new SSH console to view the analytics events.
9. In the console use command 'cd /local_storage/event_store/p/hourly/<current_date>' & navigate to the present day by giving in the date.
10.Now type in 'tail -f mobile-web_events.json.txt | grep <app-guid>' and hit enter.
11.Now type in the ip address of your apache server user to host mobile web app in the test browser. 
12.The analytics app will fire up in the IE 9 browser.
13.Click on any of the events buttons in the app.
14.You will get a pop at the bottom of IE9 saying "Internet Explorer has modified this page to help prevent cross site scripting".

Actual Result:
1. In IE,Cross-Site scripting is blocking analytics events to show up in rightscale.

Expected Result:
1. The analytics events should not be blocked by IE9.
