<h3>Description</h3>

This is not a regression.

Steps to Reproduce:
Make sure the desktop or laptops used for testing are on staging.
1. Make a default app in the studio.
2. Copy the app.js file from analytics app from 'mobile test internal' which we can get from git-hub to the resources folder of the newly created app.
3. Replace it with the already present app.js file.
4. Publish it for mobile web.
5. Sign in to your right scale account.
6. Click on 'APPC:UAT'.
7. Click on the small monitor icon against 'Net 1-Staging' in rightscale.
8. It will open up a new SSH console to view the analytics events.
9. In the console use command 'cd /local_storage/event_store/p/hourly/<current_date>' & navigate to the present day by giving in the date.
10.Now type in 'tail -f mobile-web_events.json.txt | grep <app-guid>' and hit enter.
11.Now type in the ip address of your apache server user to host mobile web app in the test browser. 
12.The analytics app will fire up in the IE 9 browser.
13.Click on any of the events buttons in the app.
14.You will see that the first button you tap on after launching the app remains in the pressed state till we relaunch the app again.

NOTE : We are getting the analytics events in analytics as expected in spite of this issue.

Actual Result:
1. Tapping on any one of the buttons first after launching analytics app in chrome,keeps the button in pressed state till the app is relaunched.

Expected Result:
1. The button should not stay in the pressed state.
