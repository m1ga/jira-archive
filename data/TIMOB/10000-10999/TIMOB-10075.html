   I need more information to set the correct priority on this feature. Please provide the use cases and what exactly needs to be supported for Exchange and iCloud groups. </li>

   Neeraj,
   
   In the current version of Titanium it is possible to retrieve the list of groups and the contacts in those groups.  Apple now provides access to the Microsoft Exchange Groups in IOS 4+.  My application needs to be able to read these Exchange groups and the contacts that are in each group so that I can use them in my application. My application is a CRM type of application and relies upon the contacts and groups that someone sets up in their iPhone/iPad when they use Microsoft Exchange.  Since Titanium already supports groups as provided by Apple in IOS 3 I wouldn't think it would be too difficult to add the Exchange groups from IOS 4 and their support.  Does this make sense or do you need more?</li>

   Stephen - Thanks for your explanation. Makes sense.</li>
