<h3>Description</h3>

Due to a restriction in the SDK, you cannot have the name of a project and a folder it contains have the same name. This restriction is case-insensitive.

<h4>Use following steps to reproduce.</h4>
1. Click on HTML-based Application from Titanium Studio Dashboard > Develop
2. Name the project <code>HTML</code>
3. Try building it. 
4. The build fails with the following [log](<a href="https://raw.github.com/gist/3166071/6670effbe58ff87ffd317081d6ded213d562417d/build.log)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://raw.github.com/gist/3166071/6670effbe58ff87ffd317081d6ded213d562417d/build.log)</a>

This seems like a wide spread developer problem and it seems to well talked about in [here](<a href="http://developer.appcelerator.com/question/119869/ios)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://developer.appcelerator.com/question/119869/ios)</a>

<h4>NOTE: This is not a template bug. </h4>

Suggested fixes:
<h4>On project creation, alert the user if a subfolder of the project conflicts with the name of the project. Unsure how to do this with templates, since the hierarchy of the template is somewhat unknown at the point of naming the project.</h4>
<h4>Warn the user if they attempt to create a folder in a project named the same as the project.</h4>

   Cannot reproduce with:
   
   Studio 2.1.1.201207171343
   SDK 2.2.0.e41ba84
   SDK 2.1.1.1bf6fbd
   SDK 2.1.1.v20120723111609 (CI build)</li>

   This is not a regression. Occurs in all versions of Titanium but can demonstrate with 2.0.1.GA2. Problem is caused by a directory (HTML) having the same name as the app (HTML).
   
   Solution: Do not name your app the same thing as a directory it contains. We cannot reasonably mangle either without causing issues so if this is encountered iOS build scripts will now print an error and abort.</li>

   Moving back to TIMOB and assigning to Core Sprint 15</li>
