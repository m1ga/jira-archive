<h3>Description</h3>

A customer has asked that we provide the "organization" attached to a certificate to display in the iOS packaging dialog. The information about the current certificates Studio derives from prereq.py.

It is suggested that the certificate JSON string be amended to include:

* Organization
* Organizational Unit

It is suggested we do this as part of prereq.py as perhaps there is other uses for this information in the context of the CLI

   This should only be applied to the new CLI</li>
<li>Chris Barber 2016-08-24

   This was fixed in the unified Appc CLI. Simply run <code>appc whoami</code>.</li>
<li>Lee Morris 2017-03-24

   Closing ticket as fixed with reference to previous comments.</li>
