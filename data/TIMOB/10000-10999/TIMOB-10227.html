   Saw an identical crash while testing TIMOB-9285. Caused by the tab group
   activity getting finished off before post open has completed (due to invalid activity detection).</li>
<li>Josh Roesslein 2012-08-06

   The Java NPE seen in the logcat has been resolved.</li>
<li>Tamila Smolich 2012-08-15

   Closing as fixed.
   Tested and verified on:
   Titanium Studio, build: 2.1.1.201208091713
   Titanium SDK, build: 2.2.0.v20120813184911
   Devices: Nexus 7 tab (4.1), HTC Evo (4.0.3), Android Emulator (2.2)</li>

   I think this was reopened due to the "comments reopen" JIRA issue. Closing.</li>
