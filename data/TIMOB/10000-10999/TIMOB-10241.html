<h3>Description</h3>

Added a deprecated version of Ti.UI.3DMatrix, but Ti.UI.create3DMatrix shows up as non-deprecated.

We could add it back in manually and deprecate it, but it seems like it should be deprecated automatically.

There might be some issues here with producing the correct documentation, however. If the deprecation annotation
included an alternate field (or something like that) identifying the Ti type replacing the object, we could generate
the appropriate summary text automatically. Have to think on that, but I'm noting the issue now before I forget it.

   Would like to propose adding information a text field to the deprecation tag.</li>

   <h4>Testing Notes</h4>
   
   * Open apidoc/Titanium/UI/Button.yml in an editor.
   
   * Add ...
   
   <code><pre>
   deprecated: {since: "2.2.0"}
   </pre></code>
   
   ... near the top (like under <code>summary</code> would be fine.)
   
   * Run <code>python apidoc/docgen.py</code>
   
   * When it's finished open dist/apidoc/index.html in a web browser.
   
   * Navigate to Titanium.UI and to the list of methods therein.
   
   * Find the <code>createButton</code> method in the list and click on it.
   
   * At the <code>createButton</code>'s documentation page you should see that the method has been deprecated since 2.2.0.</li>
