<h3>Description</h3>

Description:
When I first packaged an application using Studio, the app icon did not appear in Xcode archive. We restarted Xcode but this had no effect. Some time later, the app icon started appearing, so this may be a one-off or intermittent issue.

I am unable to determine if this is a regression as it seems to affect only Xcode and may be an Apple issue.

Steps to reproduce:
1) Create a mobile project in TitaniumStudio
2) Right click on project, choose 'Publish' > 'Distribute - Apple iTunes Store'
3) Go through dialog window, choose correct options.
4) Push 'Publish' button.

Actual result:
There is no application icon image in opened Xcode organizer window.

Expected result:
In opened Xcode organizer window should be an application icon image.

Note:
After one of the subsequent times relaunching Xcode the problem didn't occur again.
