<h3>Description</h3>

When creating a Switch control, and trying to set or view the switch 'value' attribute (which should control switch's On/Off state) It i snot working.
In KitchenSink by clicking 'Change Switch' button you can only turn off the switch.
Also tried logging switch.value, and in the log get the following result:
'Switch Value = undefined'

   This is a regression. It was working several days ago and now it is really broken.</li>
<li>Jean-Philippe Lemieux 2012-08-22

   Getter for value is not implemented.
   
   Also is seems that the apidoc for switch has never been updated.</li>
<li>Hayk Zakaryan 2012-08-22

   switch.setValue() working properly (above comment is not correct).
   Apidoc - it is mentioned that Titanium.UI.Switch.change event is implemented, but it also not working</li>
<li>Jean-Philippe Lemieux 2012-08-28

   Not quite complete the value needs to be updated when the user changes it through the UI</li>
<li>Lee Morris 2017-03-03

   Closing ticket as Blackberry is no longer supported.</li>
