<h3>Description</h3>

While running some tests for Mountain Lion, the Mac App store app discovered the Xcode installation on my Lion partition. I updated. When trying to build, I encountered various errors that were cleared up when I copied the Xcode.app locally and reset my xcode-select path to the local copy. (It seems that Xcode 4.4 now once again sets Xcode-select when launched)

Steps to reproduce:
1) Create a Mountain Lion partition on system with Lion partition
2) Boot into Mtn. Lion and configure.
3) Attempt to install Xcode (it should update your existing Lion copy)
4) Try to launch and build a project in studio

Result:
Generic errors when trying to build

Expected:
Normal build and install to iTunes

   TIMOB-10582 might have some insight, as it mentions it being on a different partition and a workaround of changing ${SDKROOT}/usr/include/libxml2 to "${SDKROOT}"/usr/include/libxml2. Because of how OSX/Unix in general handles boot and nonboot partitions, a partition named "Snow Leopard" will mean the SDKRoot path will be /Applications/XCode/Contents/Developer... while OSX is running on that partition, but "/Volumes/Snow Leopard/Applications/XCode/Contents/Developer" if OSX is running off a different partition. The space in Snow Leopard will be moot in the first case, and break the second case if not put in quotes.</li>
