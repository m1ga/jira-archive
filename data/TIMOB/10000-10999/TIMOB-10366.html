<h3>Description</h3>

The mobilesdk/osx/iphone/builder.py script has a hardcoded value for the minimum iOS deployment target (IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET) set to "4.0".  This is a reasonable default, but there are times when a developer needs to specify a higher version.  For example, in my own case, I use a module that requires iOS 5.0 and above, so my application needs to be 5.0+ or I get linker errors.

The workaround is to open the app's project file in XCode and change the setting.  This is not ideal for less-experienced developers, especially since it has to be done each time the build directory is removed.  It would be better if we could specify the minimum OS version in tiapp.xml.

   This would also help solve compiling issues when deploying to a device, since Titanium automatically compiles a new Xcode project when invoked.
   
   Currently, you have to modify the build.py file and manually force IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET and armv6,armv7 settings.</li>

   @Terry - We recently improved this use case as part of TIMOB-2999 implementation. Please take a look at this ticket and see if the latest 2.1.2 or master build helps you with your application.</li>

   Hi,
   
   Same request for me.
   Because of this problem, I can't automatize easily my builds.</li>
<li>Ingo Muschenetz 2013-06-25

   [~romain.salles] Have you looked at the fixes available in TIMOB-2999?</li>
<li>Romain Salles 2013-06-25

   No, I hadn't seen this fix and indeed, it solve the issue.
   Thanks !</li>

   It appears that the linked issue addresses the need (for now) for this feature. Marking as a duplicate. If there are related edge cases not solved by TIMOB-2999, please let us know.</li>
