<h3>Description</h3>

Many times, a single stimulus (Such as a user pressing a finger on the screen, then lifting said finger) can trigger multiple events. Which events, and the sequence of these events need to be addressed for parity.

BEHAVIOR:

Given two events that bubble, A and B, and a view hierarchy where events to view1 bubble to view2:
*Events A and B will be processed in the same order in view1 as in view2. That is, for view1, A then B, then for view2, A then B.
* Because of rules of bubbling, event A for view1 will happen before A for view2, and event B for view1 will happen before B for view2.
* Because of rules of bubbling, event A does not affect event B. For example, if A's bubbling is cancelled, B will continue to bubble.
* However, the behavior between the views and different events are undefined. Both are valid sequences:
*# View1 A, View1 B, View2 A, View2 B.
*# View1 A, View2 A, View1 B, View2 B.

Action items:
<h4>Enumerate all situations where multiple events are called</h4>
#* Eg, Click and tap, focus and open
<h4>For each, determine sequence that should happen</h4>
<h4>For each sequence, generate subtasks to implement on respective OSes.</h4>

   Situations where multiple events are called:
   <h4>Focus, blur, open, close: Window and tab Lifecycle events</h4>
   <h4>Focus and blur for textfields: Keyboard/trackpad events</h4>
   <h4>Click, tap, touchup, touchdown, swipe: touch events</h4>
   </li>
<li>Blain Hamon 2012-08-21

   Added proposal for window and tab lifecycle events. Will need to determine where blur/focus happen, and possibly propose a third pair to represent the other case.</li>
<li>Blain Hamon 2012-08-23

   Arch meeting notes: Window FSM agreed upon for open/close, and focus/blur for when a window is the primary receptor of user events (THIS IS A BEHAVIOR CHANGE). Action item for Blain was to propose a name for the event pair in the middle.</li>
<li>Blain Hamon 2012-08-27

   Text fields: Blur on old field happens before focus on new field. This happens in the same action at the OS level.</li>

   This issue should address the issue raised in TIMOB-11573.</li>
