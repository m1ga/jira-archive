   Might be something that got broken after R6. Will check this out while we are revisiting all UI controls based on R6.</li>

   This is actually something completely different. The dialog is implemented as a combo box and does not look the way it is supposed to be, and behaves odd causing this issue. There is no such thing as OptionDialog in Cascades. This will have to be implemented as a custom dialog.
   
   I don't think there is a point in trying to fix this. We need to confirm with Appcelerator if a custom implementation is needed for Beta.</li>

   Confirm this is fixed once the control is properly implemented.</li>

   This should be done post GA</li>
