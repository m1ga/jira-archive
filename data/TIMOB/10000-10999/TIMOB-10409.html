<h3>Description</h3>

With the advent of applyProperties, the value of applyLayout lessens. For several reasons, the promise of delayed/batched UI had never reached fruition. There may be ways to do this more elegantly, to re-approach this situation.

In the mean time, it is suggested that we deprecate for 2.1.2 and remove the dead code afterwards.
