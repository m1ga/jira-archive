   The workaround is to manually scale the emulator to 50% or 75%, as the default scale is 100%.
   
   75% would be consistent with previous behavior.
   
   iOS Simulator > Window > Scale (e.g., command + 1, command + 2, command + 3).
   
   Can we set these when the emulator is launched?</li>

   This is the default behavior of Xcode to bring up the iPad Simulator with maximum scale (i.e 100%) and adding the a new argument in our build scripts to manually control the size of the window of the Simulator seems like lot of work for no added advantage, when this can be done manually from the simulator itself(as described above).
   
   Marking this bug as won't fix.</li>

   It is not an acceptable workflow to manually resize the iPad simulator every time it is launched. As per discussion, it is desirable to have this argument and a corresponding Titanium Studio run configuration setting.</li>

   Will revisit this issue post 3.0 release. </li>

   I cannot reproduce with Titanium SDK master (6.1.0) using an iPad Air or iPad Air 2 simulator.</li>
<li>Lee Morris 2017-03-24

   Closing ticket as the issue cannot be reproduced and with reference to the previous comments.</li>
