<h3>Description</h3>

Scrollbars are created even if showHorizontalScrollIndicator et al is false (or perhaps once created they aren't destroyed if showHorizontalScrollIndicator is later set to false). This currently causes a crash because of TIMOB-10470, although once that bug is fixed the code will work fine. It will still be inefficient though.
