<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Problem description</h4>
When trying to build an app for iOS, if the computer's date is moved back after a succesful build, the process won't work anymore


<h4>Steps to reproduce</h4>
1. Change the computer's date to a future date (even 1h later is ok)
2. Perform a clean build of any project in Studio to iPhone Simulator
3. Change back to the current date

From now on, the build won't work anymore for that project and that SDK version, giving the error:

<code><pre>
[ERROR] fatal error: file '/Users/username/Titanium/TestApp/build/iphone/TestApp_Prefix.pch' has been modified since the precompiled header was built
</pre></code>

I tried to clean the project from Studio and to delete the directory DerivedData, but none helps.
