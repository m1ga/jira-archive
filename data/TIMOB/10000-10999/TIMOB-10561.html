<h3>Description</h3>

Steps to reproduce:
1.From IOS 6 we can view console logs from mobile safari using remote debugging using USB cable on to our desktop safari.
2.Setup the remote debugging for Iphone.
3.Package kitchensink for mobileweb & host it on to your apache server.
4.Host it on your apache server.
5.Launch the kitchensink app on mobile safari.
6.Launch the console window on your desktop machine or laptop through desktop safari.
7.In the kitchensink app execute tests like ,KitchenSink:Views>Web Views>Inline HTML w/Trans Bg ; KitchenSink:Views>Web Views>Inline HTML w/Color Bg etc.
8.You will see that tapping on them freezes the app & we have to refresh the page to load the app again.
9.If we do not launch the console & execute the same tests they work perfectly fine.

Actual result:
1.Testing kitchensink with safari remote debugging console(IOS 6) open in your laptop,causes some tests to freeze while executing.

Expected result:
2.The tests should not freeze.

   This issue is seen on IOS6 beta 4 device with app packaged using iOS SDK version 5.1.
   
   Tested using:
   Ipad 3 iOS 6 beta 4
   Iphone4S iOS 6 beta 4
   SDK : 2.1.3.v20120904163110
   Kitchensink built with iOS sdk 5.1

   I've only ever used the Safari remote debugging stuff once and it worked just fine once you got past the horrible new web inspector in Safari 6. I don't remember if the app I was testing was KitchenSink or not. I don't really see this as a blocker. I was doing some testing with the iOS6 betas and noticed significant changes and fixes as the betas progressed. I'd be curious if this is still an issue given that the gold masters of iOS 6 are now available.</li>

   Update : This issue is also seen on the iOS 6 GM on both Iphone 4S & Ipad 3.
   
   Tested using kitchensink built with:
   Titanium studio : 2.1.2.201208301612
   SDK version : 2.1.3.v20120920154617</li>
