<h3>Description</h3>

Ever since 0.9, we expose properties based on key value coding and checking for method selectors. The problem is that this inadvertently expose items that:
<h4>Internal proxy properties not designed to work with JS</h4>
<h4>NSObject properties and methods not designed for JS</h4>

For example, TiWindowProxy has an internal method _window pointing to the App's UIWindow. Or even more comically, the -[retain] and -[autorelease] meet the signature of a property. JS can refer to these false properties and crash the app. This is bad.

This was part of the design, dating back to 0.9.

Steps:
<h4>Come up with new protocol that is not KVC-discoverable</h4>
<h4>Implement secondary protocol</h4>
<h4>Transition to secondary protocol</h4>
<h4>Phase out older KVC-based ones</h4>
