<h3>Description</h3>

On some of our test systems, attempting to run Studio-produced Xcode projects fails to compile.

This is hard to determine if a regression as it is restricted to certain systems.

We have limited information on why this is occurring, but Sabil has found that placing a set of quotes around the $SDK root entry in the header paths resolves the issue for affected systems. For example, changing ${SDKROOT}/usr/include/libxml2 to "${SDKROOT}"/usr/include/libxml2.

This may be related somehow to the images used to create our Mountain Lion partitions.

Also of note, on the affected systems the Studio build for device and for simulator function as expected.

Steps to reproduce
1) Have IT install your Mountain Lion image
2) Install Xcode 4.4.1
3) Create a new project using Studio
4) Build the project (simulator or device)
5) Navigate to the build folder
6) Double-click the Xcode project file
7) In Xcode, attempt to build the project

Result:
Compile fails, please see screenshot

Expected:
Compile functions as expected.

   This may be a dual-partition issue related to Xcode being installed and run from the Mountain Lion partition while running Lion. It is known that this configuration is not ideal and causes problems.
   
   I expect we will be setting this as invalid after a little more investigation.

   This seems to be a limitation of Xcode. When xcode is installed on a non-boot partition it has problems building. The launch of Xcode 4.4.1 will set the xcode-select -path regardless of which partition xcode is installed on and will have build failures when opening studio projects and trying to build within xcode. We will verify wether or not this configuration with Xcode-created projects will fail as well.</li>

   Possibly related to TIMOB-10360.</li>
