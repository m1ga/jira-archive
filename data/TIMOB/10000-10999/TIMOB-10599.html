<h3>Description</h3>

This ticket relies on the linked Ti Studio ticket. Once the new JSCA format has been defined, we need to support it.

   Per the linked issues, in the short term, we're going to place the deprecation warning (if any) into the JSCA description.
   
   We should probably append it after the description, like:
   
   <p>\{summary}. <b>Deprecated since {version}. {deprecation note}</b></p>
   
   I've tried several variations on this, and it appears that Studio ignores most formatting (except the <b>), so Adding it as a separate paragraph isn't useful.
   
   We will also need to add the deprecation flag for members, which Studio does not support yet. Need to find out whether this change will require a rev of the JSCA version #.</li>

   <h4>Testing notes</h4>
   
   <h4>Build and release the test branch.  Be sure _not_ to build it with <code>scons build_jsca=0</code> since obviously we need the JSCA to be built. :)</h4>
   <h4>Get the latest nightly of Titanium Studio.</h4>
   <h4>Open Titanium Studio.</h4>
   <h4>Create a Titanium Project and target the version of the mobile sdk you are testing.  That should be either 3.1.0 or 3.0.0 (the latter would be when you are testing the backport Pull Request).</h4>
   <h4>Open app.js.</h4>
   <h4>Begin typing <code>var x = Ti.UI.Android.LINKIFY_ALL;</code>.  Once you type past <code>Ti.UI.Android.</code>, be sure to pay attention to the code completion's description of <code>LINKIFY_ALL</code>.  It should include deprecation information in it.</h4>
   <h4>Finish typing that line and hit Enter.  After a few seconds the yellow warning indicator should show on <code>LINKIFY_ALL</code> and if you hover over it you should see the warning that it is deprecated.</h4>
