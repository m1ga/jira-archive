   I can't seem to run "titanium status" if I'm logged out, which kind of breaks the ability of us using as a means of determining our current login status. It interactively prompts me for my username and password.</li>

   Strange, it works fine for me. Did you recently pull from titanium and node-appc master branches? These changes were added just a few days ago.</li>

   I just pulled and reinstalled titanium package from master. Now status seems to work fine for me both online and offline. However, if I run logout while already logged out I get interactively prompted for my username/password (like status used to be doing).
   
   I'm assuming I should be using "titanium status --no-colors --no-banner -o json" as a means for Studio to be able to easily query our login/logout status?</li>

   @Chris, this was fixed last night in this commit: <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium/commit/71d9694484ad7f347d8a4206728a40dbd17935b8." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium/commit/71d9694484ad7f347d8a4206728a40dbd17935b8.</a> Make sure you are constantly pulling the latest updates.
   
   Yeah, you should probably pass --no-colors --no-banner to all commands and --output json to the config, project, and status. We will probably add --output json to more commands in the near future, but let me know what commands you'd prefer json output for.</li>

   Closing ticket as fixed.</li>
