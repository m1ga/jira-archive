<h3>Description</h3>

The run hook is responsible for opening the app in a web browser.

Optionally, it can start an HTTP server to host the files. The HTTP server must support static file sharing. It can listen on any non-privileged port and would shutdown when the build command finished.

When no browser is specified, then it will use the system default. We should support all installed desktop browsers as well as Android and iOS. For Android, there would be a <code>--device-id</code> of the emulator/device to open the browser on. iOS Simulator may not be possible. iOS device should be possible once the node-ios-device module add support for opening URLs.
