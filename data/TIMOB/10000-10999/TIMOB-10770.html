   Why is this in core?
   
   Clearly the problem is that the app includes Google Maps code in it and google maps libraries are *not* on the Nook.</li>

   Sorry, that was a bit rude.  Obviously it wouldn't be "clear" to anyone who hadn't had experience with that error before.  But either way, it seems odd that this is in "core".</li>

   @Bill Dawson- i have no idea why it was labelled a core issue. This issue was not resolved yet as we don't have a nook in house to test or verify the fix for it. Sorry about the confusion.  :D </li>

   Thanks @Sabil Rahim, I heard later in the day that it was a mistake with a bulk update of tickets that accidentally put it within core.  :-)</li>

   Still no devices. Moving to next sprint</li>

   Marking as hold till we get devices in house</li>
