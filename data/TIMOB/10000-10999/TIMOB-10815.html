<h3>Description</h3>

Currently there is a property on TabGroup called "activeTabBackgroundColor" which
allows you to specify the tab's color when that tab is activated. Currently there is no
property to set the active color per a tab.

A proposal to the architectural community should be made to approve for adding
a property to Tab called "activeBackgroundColor". This property controls the color
of the tab when it is active.

Note: Android currently implements this active color behavior using Tab.backgroundSelectedColor.
This creates a parity issue with MobileWeb which uses this property to control the color when
the tab is pressed down (much like a button would change color when pressed and held down).
We should probably change Android to implement this press down behavior and map the active color
behavior to the new "activeBackgroundColor" property.

Do NOT implement this feature until it is approved by the architectural counsel.

   -FWIW, we implement the activeBackgroundColor property such that it sets the active background color of the tab, so basically exactly what this ticket is asking for.-
   
   Nevermind, I was thinking of something else.
   
   So really we need to implement 8 new properties: [active , active disabled , active focused , active selected] X [color, image] so that it matches the 8 active* properties on TabGroup.</li>
