<h3>Description</h3>

Description:
Application exits from Simulator with iOS SDK 6.0 on every launch if /Library/Application Support/iPhone Simulator/6.0/Applications is not empty. The only way to get the simulator to work again is by deleting everything under /Library/Application Support/iPhone Simulator/6.0/Applications, the app will run in simulator only if this folder is empty.

Works fine for iOS SDK 5.1 Simulator in Xcode 4.5.

Note: there is some information pointing to the simulator or iOS 6 SDK itself at:
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9702201/xcode-compiles-my-app-but-cant-run-it-in-the-simulator" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9702201/xcode-compiles-my-app-but-cant-run-it-in-the-simulator</a>

Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a new project for iOS
2. Run the new project on Simulator with iOS SDK 6.0

Actual result:
The app exits from Simulator

Expected result:
The app should be successfully run on Simulator

   Make sure Xcode 4.5 is installed properly.</li>

   For this issue, we had dev investigate with us and somehow through our experiments, despite making no changes, the configuration began working as expected. It is unclear what the root cause was, and we will watch for this issue as the rest of the team transitions to Xcode 4.5.

   This is happening consistently on my system.
   
   OS: Mac OS X 10.7.4
   Titanium Studio, build: 3.0.1.201210141904
   Titanium SDK, 2.1.3.GA
   Device: iPhone Simulator 6.0
   XCode, 4.5.1
   
   *If I clean out the application folder in the simulator then the application successfully runs in the iPhone 6 simulator. If I have any applications in the simulator's application folder then the simulator starts but immediately closes when trying to run the application.*</li>

   * OS.X 10.7.4
   * Titanium Studio 3.0.0.201210220122
   * SDK mobilesdk-3.0.0.v20121019153308

   I'm going to resolve this again since this appears to be working for me, and I would like someone to confirm.</li>
<li>Ingo Muschenetz 2012-10-22

   I definitely have applications in "/Users/ingo/Library/Application Support/iPhone Simulator/6.0/Applications" and this does not cause an issue for me.</li>
<li>Jeff English 2012-10-22

   Downgraded my installation of Ti Studio to 2.1.2 and then upgraded to 3.0.0 and now it works fine, even with applications installed on the 6.0 simulator. Perhaps an issue with 3.0.1, but not exactly sure.</li>
<li>Ingo Muschenetz 2012-10-23

   So, I just had this issue myself. Deleting the contents of the above folder fixes it. After experiencing that and deleting the folder, I couldn't reproduce again.</li>
<li>Olga Romero 2012-12-04

    Closing as fixed,
    Tested with:
    Titanium Studio, build: 3.0.0.201211301903
    Titanium SDK, build: 3.0.0.v20121130200208
    iOS simulator: 6.0</li>
