<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Problem</h4>
When you create a New | Titanium Mobile Project, <iphone> and <mobileweb> sections get added to the initial TiApp.xml file, even though the project is Android only (iPhone and Mobile Web were unchecked).

<h4>Expected Behavior</h4>
No <iphone> or <mobileweb> sections should be added to the initial TiApp.xml file when creating a new Android-only project.

Likewise, no <android> or <mobileweb> sections should be added when creating an iPhone-only project.

<h4>Actual Behavior</h4>
<h4>Create a New | Titanium Mobile Project.</h4>
<h4>Uncheck Mobile Web and iPhone.</h4>
<h4>The resulting TiApp.xml file will have <iphone> and <mobileweb> sections in it.</h4>

   Resolving ticket as "Won't fix" as MobileWeb has been deprecated.</li>

   Lee, that doesn't address the issue though.  If a project is Android only, no iPhone section should be added to TiApp.xml either. And vice versa.  And if MobileWeb is going away, then no MobileWeb section should be created at all, under any circumstances.</li>

   I agree with [~bitshftr] that this ticket should not have been closed because "MobileWeb has been deprecated", however it's pretty safe to say we are not going to fix this ticket. The <code>tiapp.xml</code> is just a static file that we copy into new projects. The <code><deployment-targets></code> is a Studio thing that the CLI doesn't care about.
   
   We intentionally leave the platform specific sections in there in case you are developing your app on multiple machines (or in a team) and targeting machine-specific platforms. For example, you create your project on a Mac, but then check it out on Windows to build for Windows Phone.
   
   In any case, the <code><mobileweb></code> section of the <code>tiapp.xml</code> will get ripped out as soon as we have the green light to rip it out of the Titanium SDK.
   
   To make this even less of an issue, there's going to be discussions in the coming months about the shortcomings of the <code>tiapp.xml</code> and the future of project settings file.</li>
