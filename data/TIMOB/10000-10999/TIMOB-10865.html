<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Issue</h4>

If i build my project:
builder.py adhoc ...
then the resources of my project are not copied in the app folder

It works with 2.1.2.GA

<h4>Steps to Reproduce</h4>

1. Create a templated tabbed application in Studio.
2. Publish using adhoc license.
3. Look in the app generated. The package contents do not have KS_nav_ui and KS_nav_views.png files

   Hi Martin,
   
   Could you please provided more info i.e. a minimum fail case (a project that shows this) and the exact commands you used.
   
   Thanks,
   Varun

   It happens with the template examples in TStudio (on what is now 3.0.0).
   Create a tab based example for iphone.
   Publish it for adhoc distribution
   Look at the payload: Ks_nav_ui.png and KS_nav_views.png wont be there</li>

   Any news on this one? This is a critical bug as i cant make a release anymore
   THanks</li>

   @Martin - This issue is scheduled to be fixed for the next release (3.0.0).</li>
<li>Martin Guillon 2012-09-19

   @Neeraj: thanks for letting me know. I am working on the master branch as i do a lot of modification on Ti sources. So for me no more release until it s fixed (not even released) :s
   That s kind of bad but that s my fault.
   
   Thanks</li>

   i found the reason for that bug. it s due to that commit
   <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/commit/b96d1f810381eba1f567437a069a0b9b92010bc5" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/commit/b96d1f810381eba1f567437a069a0b9b92010bc5</a>
   I added a line comment.
   i hope mstepanov can look at this
   adhoc and distribution is broken in the way that any external ressource not in iphone is not copied to the package</li>

   Is there any workaround available? I'm also having this problem with current 3.0 SDK from continuous builds...
   </li>
<li>Martin Guillon 2012-10-06

   Yes there is. see my line comment
   <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/commit/b96d1f810381eba1f567437a069a0b9b92010bc5#L0R648" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/commit/b96d1f810381eba1f567437a069a0b9b92010bc5#L0R648</a>

   I use the current continuous build for 3.0 SDK (with your commit already included) and  still have the same problem. When run in simulator or by "run on device", everything's fine. When I build for enterprise build, the images are missing in the app. So the problem is probably also caused by another part of the build script / process.
   iOS SDK 6.0 with current Xcode version, iOS 6.0 on iPad 2.</li>

    My commit is not included! This is not my commit, this is just a line comment!
    I just commited an ugly fix in my own branch.
    It works, i already published apps with it!
