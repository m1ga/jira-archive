<h3>Description</h3>

We need to run the code processor against some well known, complex code samples. We can use the data for debugging and planning new features in the code processor.

<h3>Comments</h3>

   Most complex samples rely on modules, so we can't validate until module support has been implemented.</li>

   The unknown/ambiguous reporter will be essential in determining why the known samples are not being fully analyzed</li>
<li>Bryan Hughes 2012-12-03

   The updated analysis coverage plugin will be really useful in narrowing down what is not being analyzed</li>

   Changing this ticket to a placeholder ticket that will eventually contain subtasks. The nature of the subtasks will be dependent on how other tickets go.</li>

   This seems like an open ended ticket for a product that is dead.</li>
