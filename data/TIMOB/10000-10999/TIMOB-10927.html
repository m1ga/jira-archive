<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Issue</h4>

Currently, in Ti SDK, if we use "get directions", the application opens up google maps web interface. 

It is requested to have the feature to open the native (Apple) maps application as was the case with iOS 5.1.1.

Related native method: openMapsWithItems:launchOptions: or openInMapsWithLaunchOptions: method of MKMapItem

   Probably going to create this as a module, as there is no ties or relations to existing classes, and MKMapItem does not inherit from any of the other maps classes.
   
   Also, this moots parity issues because there's nothing similar in other OSes.</li>

   The way to do this in iOS 6 is as easy as always:
   iOS 5
   <code><pre>
   Ti.App.openUrl('<a href="https://maps.google.com/?q=1200+Pennsylvania+Ave+SE" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://maps.google.com/?q=1200+Pennsylvania+Ave+SE</a>,+Washington,+District+of+Columbia,+20003');
   </pre></code>
   
   iOS 6
   <code><pre>
   Ti.App.openUrl('<a href="https://maps.apple.com/?q=1200+Pennsylvania+Ave+SE" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://maps.apple.com/?q=1200+Pennsylvania+Ave+SE</a>,+Washington,+District+of+Columbia,+20003');
   </pre></code></li>

   Talked with Pedro and with Ingo on this. Now that there's a workaround, the need has lowered and this no longer is required for 3.0. Moving back to backlog.</li>

   Workaround in comments. No longer any immediate requirement for this. TBS </li>
