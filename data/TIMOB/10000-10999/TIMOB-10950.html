<h3>Description</h3>

Contacts display google synched contacts also when fetched through id whereas it doesn't while picking contacts through display people or contacts picker.
This is not regression as this issue occurs as far as 2.1.0.

Steps to reproduce:
Add some contacts to contacts list and sync google account with some contacts.
1. Go to Kitchensink> Phone> Contacts.
2. Click on display people. 
3. Click on search by Id. enter ids.

Actual:
2. Contacts are displayed but google account contacts are not displayed. 
3. It extracts the google contacts and phone contacts both.

Expected:
Same contacts should be retrieved while fetching through 'display people' and ' Search by Id'.
