<h3>Description</h3>

Design the module framework that will be used for implementing both our core modules (ex: UI, Network) and third party modules.

<h4>Requirements</h4>
  - Each module should be contained in its own folder (Ex: modules/ui)
  - Use the CommonJS API for loading both JS and native modules.
  - Define a native API for exporting modules. When a native module
    library is loaded and "init" method should be invoked providing
    an exports object. This is simliar to how JS modules export APIs.
  - Provide an ABI stable interface to maintain module compatibility with platform releases.
    While providing ABI safety across all platform versions may be impractical,
    we should still provide compatibility at least between minor version releases
    (ex: compile module against 3.0 remains compatible with 3.1, but not 4.0).
  - Build system to compile modules and package for deployment.
  - Ability to export asset files (ex: images) for use at runtime.

<h4>Architectural Designs</h4>

References to any architectural documents and diagrams
that will serve as guidelines during the project.
