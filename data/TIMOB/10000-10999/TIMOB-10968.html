<h3>Description</h3>

Clicking on 'Enable' toggle button does not disable the textfield and does not bring keyboard down. This issue occurs on the devices with Android version lesser than 3.0. 
This is not regression since the issue occurs on 2.1.2 GA as well.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Go to Kitchensink> Controls> Textfield> The Rest.
2. Click on the textfield. The textfield should be enabled and keyboard should pop up.
3. Click the button 'Enabled' two times(another bug is logged for it). The textfield seems disabled(opacity changes).

Actual:
The keyboard is up and if you type something, it's being typed into textfield.

Expected:
The textfield is disabled. So, keyboard should be down and user should not be able to type anything into it.
