   We do need to solve this for 2.1.4. Updated as appropriate.</li>

   The problem here is that some cameras, specifically Samsung Galaxy S2 and Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1, will always take the picture in landscape, and then store the orientation inside the EXIF data.  This is the case when you take a picture in the native camera app (without any Titanium code). Inside the native gallery app, they most likely check for the EXIF data and rotate it accordingly which is why you see it 'rotated' correctly.  In titanium, we have added a property to do this inside the image view, called 'autorotate'.  The example in the ticket is exhibiting the correct behavior since that's how the image was stored and the height/width will reflect on those values accordingly.  Titanium does not currently support looking up the EXIF data but I have linked a ticket that's related to the feature.

   Marking as won't fix for now. Please refer to the ticket about exposing EXIF data.</li>
