<h3>Description</h3>

Right now the Blackberry platform uses a native hashing method for dispatching
proxy method calls to their associated native method. This isn't the most efficent
means of dispatch and bypasses the performance of V8's "class" optimizations.

We should look into what work would be required to use V8's template API
for creating the proxy native prototypes.

   Do write-up of spec for review</li>

   Open tickets for later release</li>

   This is sorely needed as the current setter getter designs (macros) are really bad. Moving this to a later sprint however to know off a few more key features.</li>

   This should be post GA</li>

   In TiObject.cpp we are using ObjectTemplates so I believe we are doing what what is described in the embedder's guide as far as ObjectTemplate creation. We are not using SetAccessor which is nice but at this point I don't believe adds value worth the effort.</li>
