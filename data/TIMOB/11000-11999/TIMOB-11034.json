		"description": "E-mail thread with Russ:\r\n\r\n\r\n I don't need anything fancy and code snippets are really helpful. Once I see the code I can usually figure it out. Here are a list of items I would like to understand better. Also we can video Skype chat if that would be helpful. \r\n\r\n1) MSBuild and VisualStudio\r\n   1) How does the current CLI integrate with the Microsoft develop tools\r\n   2) How do you plan to separate WinPhone from Win8 solutions and projects but keep shared components like SpiderMonkey\r\n   3) Are there WinRT vs WinPRT that I need to be aware of?\r\n   3) How will we deploy to device?\r\n2) What are the steps to take the open source SpiderMonkey project and use for Windows\r\n   1) What version of SpiderMonkey are we using? Any notes on why future versions? Will they cause trouble?\r\n   2) Are there any unit test around SpiderMonkey to make sure it plugs into Windows? If not maybe some thoughts on how those would look?\r\n3) What are some key debug locations? Once the new repo is setup and I can run on my laptop where are some areas I can set breakpoints and see the guts and glory.\r\n   1) Where is the app loop what does it look like\r\n   2) What is the threading model\r\n   3) Are there event queues? How do they work?\r\n4) Titanium Bindings\r\n  1) Where are they?\r\n  2) A simple example of hooking up a button and properties would be great\r\n5) How should multiple resolutions be implemented going forward.\r\n\r\nWe could put the list and answers in the docs section of the new repo, it can be a real rough draft just something to get me started.\r\n\r\n",
