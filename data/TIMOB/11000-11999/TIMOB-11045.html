<h3>Description</h3>

While verifying splash screens for iPhone 5 simulator, we encountered a small visual problem: the splash seemed to change color on some of the app launches. When using HTML 5, it was more obvious what was happening since the iPhone 5 splash (Default-568h@2x.png) has no HTML5 badge, while the iPhone 4/4s splash has the badge. 

With this test you can see there is no badge, then the badge appears and the app loads. THe issue is the "@2x" screen is being scaled to fit the screen and so has its content distorted.

This is not a regression.

Steps to reproduce:
1) Create a new studio project with either SDK listed using HTML 5 template
2) Run in iPhone 5 simulator
3) Watch for splash screen changes

Result:
Iphone 5 splash shown, then replaced with @2x version

Expected:
No change in splash prior to launch

   there is maybe more to do :
   what if we want to set background for a View with 'Default-568h@2x' ? 
   
   the path will not be found because we have to search in the  Main Bundle.
   
   please have a look at :
   
    TiUtils.m
   +(UIImage*)loadBackgroundImage:(id)image forProxy:(TiProxy*)proxy
   
   and
   
   UIModule.m
   +(UIImage*)loadBackgroundImage:(id)image forProxy:(TiProxy*)proxy
   
   in both methods we have :
   
   if (resultImage==nil && [image isEqualToString:@"Default.png"])
           {
   
               // special case where we're asking for Default.png and it's in Bundle not path
   
               resultImage = [UIImage imageNamed:image];
           
   }
   
   btw this should also not work with Ipad Default-*.png

   There is some change in splash prior to launch, looks like the appcelerator logo is repositioning or the image is scaling.
