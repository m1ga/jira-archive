<h3>Description</h3>

This is not a regression. It occurs since 2.0.1.

Animation changes are reverted, if orientation of device is changed except for 'Full Window'.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Launch refactored Kitchen Sink (Kevin Winnerey/Developer relations version) > Base UI > Animation > Transitions
2. Click the button 'Full view' and change orientation of device

Actual result:
1. After step 2, a view is displayed which disappears on orientation change.

Expected result:
1. After step 2, a view should be displayed which should not disappear on orientation change.

The same goes for below displayed image view,buttonbar,button and toolbar. Their animation also revert in case of orientation change.
