<h3>Description</h3>

This is not a regression. It occurs since 2.0.1.

If the window orientation is changed while Animate(Scale) and Animate(Custom), the window do not comes back to the screen size. A white space is left out (white spcae below for portrait and at side for landscape)

Steps to reproduce:
1. Launch refactored Kitchen Sink (Kevin Winnerey/Developer relations version) > Base UI > Animation > Windows
2. Click the button 'Animate(Scale)' and quickly change orientation of device

Actual result:
1. After step 2, a view is displayed which do not covers the entire screen.

Expected result:
1. After step 2, a view should be displayed which should cover the entire screen.

The same goes for Animate(Custom) from the time its working (around 2.1.1). It also leves white space if device is rotated while animation.

   This seems to be an animation timing issue. Allowing the animation to complete then rotating will not show any poor behavior. Rotating during animation results in the window not filling the screen.
   
   This is easily reproducible in iPad simulator (6.0)
   This also occurs with master SDK 3.0.0.v20120921051359
   This occurs with iOS 5.1 devices
   This occurs with SDK 2.1.1GA and 2.1.2GA (Xcode 4.4.1)
