<h3>Description</h3>

Apparently there is a requirement to the build process that a project cannot have the same name as a commonjs module in the Resources directory. Alloy projects all have an "alloy.js" module in Resources. When you create a project named "alloy" and attempt to run it, you get the following errors:

<h4>ios</h4>
<code><pre>
Project name alloy conflicts with resource named /Users/tlukasavage/Documents/Titanium Studio Workspace/alloy/Resources/alloy: Cannot build. Please change one.
</pre></code>

<h4>android</h4>
<code><pre>

</pre></code>

The above install statement never finishes for android as I assume the apk is never created.

We should allow developers to name apps whatever they want, or we should be giving them notifications in TiStudio letting them know before the project is even created that the name is not allowed.

   Unable to reproduce with Titanium SDK master (6.1.0) and Alloy 1.9.1. No idea when it was fixed, but now you can name all your apps "alloy".</li>

   Closing ticket as the issue cannot be reproduced and with reference to the previous comments.</li>
