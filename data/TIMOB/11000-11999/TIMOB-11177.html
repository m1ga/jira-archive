<h3>Description</h3>

Problem:
My app with a wildcard app-id failed validation during publishing to App Store in Xcode. It said the Bundle ID was invalid. It could be fixed by creating the non-wildcard app-id in Apple site and pubilsh it with the new provision.

   Hello Eric,
   
   I am going to try and reproduce this. Can you please provide a little more detail about your app setup? Are you trying to release a suite of apps with similar app IDs? Could you provide examples of the iTunes Connect and Apple developer portal settings you made for the app ID and provision?</li>
<li>Eric Merriman  2012-09-26

   I tried 2 scenarios:
   1) Xcode 4.5/iOS SDK 6.0, Titanium SDK 2.1.3.v20120925173111
   Developer portal settings:
   app id: com.eric.*
   Provision: Distribution- app store
   
   Studio settings:
   App ID: com.eric.*
   
   Attempted to build with provision, and Studio will not build, citing "*" as an illegal character. 
   <code><pre>
   [ERROR] (null): error: CFBundleIdentifier 'com.eric.*' contains illegal character '*' 
   [ERROR] 
   [ERROR] Error: Traceback (most recent call last):
     File "/Users/emerriman/Library/Application Support/Titanium/mobilesdk/osx/2.1.3.v20120925173111/iphone/builder.py", line 1541, in main
       execute_xcode("iphoneos%s" % iphone_version,args,False)
     File "/Users/emerriman/Library/Application Support/Titanium/mobilesdk/osx/2.1.3.v20120925173111/iphone/builder.py", line 1221, in execute_xcode
       output = run.run(args,False,False,o)
     File "/Users/emerriman/Library/Application Support/Titanium/mobilesdk/osx/2.1.3.v20120925173111/iphone/run.py", line 41, in run
       sys.exit(rc)
   SystemExit: 65
   </pre></code>
   
   Second scenario:
   2) Xcode 4.5/iOS SDK 6.0, Titanium SDK 2.1.3.v20120925173111
   Developer portal settings:
   app id: com.eric.*
   Provision: Distribution- app store
   
   Studio settings:
   App ID: com.eric.app1
   
   Failed with attached screenshot. Seems there is some info on this on the web. We will continue to investigate.</li>

   Do we have the project file? We should compare with a native app.</li>
<li>Eric Merriman  2012-10-17

   Blain, I do not have the community app. All you need to do is follow my steps above outside of titanium to test that scenario.</li>

   Please let me know if I need to create an additional ticket for this. I'm not certain this issue is related:
   
   I have an existing app that used a wildcard in the App Identifier. I need to update the App. When I Validate the build with xCode I received this error:
   
   This bundle is invalid. The application-identifier entitlement is not formatted correctly; it should contain your 10-character App ID Seed, followed by a dot, followed by your bundle identifier: xxxxxxxxxx.com.HHapps.WhatTheHunt*
   
   I came across this: TIMOB-11177 and attemtped the work around in it: I created a new App ID without the wild card and a new provisioning profile based on the new App ID. I then tried to build the app and it continues to give me the same error above.
   
   I also received this error on a sister app and followed the work around above and it worked fine. 
   
   The difference between the two apps:
   
   The app that Validates with the error mentioned above was the original App and its App ID is: com.HHapps.WhatTheHunt. When other Apps followed, they were specific to a state so they became: com.HHapps.WhatTheHuntIA (for Iowa). When I added a new profile for that app (Iowa) without the wildcard, the rebuild went fine. The original app has an App ID that is not longer than the bundle identifier with the wildcard.</li>
<li>Max Stepanov 2013-03-20

   I believe this could be Entitlements.plist validation issue.
   AppStore does not allow wildcard appIDs when certain entitlements are requested, such as push notifications, in-app purchases, game center.</li>
<li>Blain Hamon 2013-03-21

   Wait, rewind. They used an app ID with a wildcard? [From Apple's docs](<a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CoreFoundationKeys.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009249-102070-TPXREF105)." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CoreFoundationKeys.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009249-102070-TPXREF105).</a>
   
   {quote}
   
   The bundle ID string must be a uniform type identifier (UTI) that contains only alphanumeric (A-Z,a-z,0-9), hyphen (\-), and period (.) characters. The string should also be in reverse-DNS format. For example, if your company’s domain is Ajax.com and you create an app named Hello, you could assign the string com.Ajax.Hello as your app’s bundle identifier.
   
   {quote}
   
   "\*" is not a valid character in an app ID. Note that the entitlement allows for app IDs but also for wildcard searches which *are* *not* *app* *IDs*. I'd be like naming a picture file "\*.\*".
   
   Marking invalid.</li>
<li>Blain Hamon 2013-03-21

   A wildcard is not a valid app ID, per Apple's docs.</li>
<li>Eric Merriman  2013-07-29

   Hello, see attached image from the developer portal. Here is the text from the setting in the portal:
   Wildcard App ID
   This allows you to use a single App ID to match multiple apps. To create a wildcard App ID, enter an asterisk (*) as the last digit in the Bundle ID field.
   
   </li>
<li>Eric Merriman  2013-07-30

    Reopening for more investigation. I think it should be possible to submit a wildcard app ID providing push is not enabled, and other "fully formed" app ID requirements are not in place.</li>

    [~emerriman] Have you any new wisdom in the past 3 years about this?</li>
