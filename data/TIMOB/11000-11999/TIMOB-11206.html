   It would be awesome.</li>

   definitely seconding this</li>

   Hi guys,
   
   Please have a look at this: <a href="https://github.com/steipete/PSTCollectionView" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/steipete/PSTCollectionView</a>
   Its a 100% compatible version, meaning iOS5 could get support for UICollectionView as well. 
   
   UICollectionView for iOS and GridView for android would be great new UI components! </li>
<li>Joseph Sachs 2013-09-22

   Just a note: In iOS 7, we can have custom navigation transitions between UICollectionViews.

   All, we've been doing research into implementing this feature, but it does require us implementing Auto Layout. Currently, we are investigating that functionality for Ti.Next (TIMOB-14599). We will see if there is an alternate implementation possible, or the ability to do similar functionality with our existing infrastructure.
   
   In the meantime, someone might consider implementing a module utilizing <a href="https://github.com/steipete/PSTCollectionView" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/steipete/PSTCollectionView</a> as Mads suggested.</li>
<li>Rick Blalock 2014-08-05

   UICollectionView does not require auto-layout, fyi.</li>
<li>Joseph Sachs 2014-08-05

   @Rick I think for device Orientation it does require it... not sure.</li>
<li>Hazem Khaled 2016-02-23

   We really need this feature, specially we have auto layout now (if it required)</li>
<li>Joseph Sachs 2016-02-23

<li>Bert Grantges 2016-02-24

    As we look to add this API I would like to ensure that we look at it from a parity perspective with the inclusion of Android and Windows GridView classes as we can leverage Hyperloop now for one offs</li>
<li>Hans Knöchel 2016-04-24

    [~bgrantges@appcelerator.com] We should setup a wiki for 6.0.0 on how the different platforms handle GridView's/CollectionViews's in order to design an API that can work cross-platform. Very interested in doing this with Hyperloop.</li>
<li>Nuno Costa 2016-06-29

    Since "autolayout" is now in Titanium right?  The UICollectionView for ios and GridView/android should be a huge addition with Appc support.
    
    Community will appreciate for sure!
    
    The only Native-wise module out there is [<a href="https://github.com/mpociot/TiCollectionView" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/mpociot/TiCollectionView</a>] but very fast is out dated and not support "UI main thread" 
     I have been try updating best as I can,  but I'm not  an ios/android guru,  [<a href="https://github.com/nuno/TiCollectionView/commits/master" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/nuno/TiCollectionView/commits/master</a>]  
    
    @Hans Knoechel  any help with the module to work with "UI main thread" is great! :)
    
     I Still prefer Appc native one!
    
    
    P.S. Have you guys seen the What's New in UICollectionView in iOS 10? wow!!

    Quick update here: If you have Hyperloop and want to use the <code>UICollectionView</code> API today, please check out [this example](<a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/hyperloop-examples/blob/master/app/controllers/ios/collectionview.js)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/hyperloop-examples/blob/master/app/controllers/ios/collectionview.js)</a> in our Hyperloop Sample app that uses a native <code>UICollectionView</code> to display a threee-columned grid of 50 colors. It can easily be modularized (maybe something for loopmodules, [~rdperottoni] :-) and then be used across multiple projects. Thanks!</li>
<li>Carlos Henrique Zinato 2016-09-01

    +1 on it!
    nice work btw Nuno Costa</li>
<li>Joseph Sachs 2016-09-01

    +1 on for the Hyperloop example for UICollectionView!!</li>
<li>Hans Knöchel 2016-11-04

    Resolving this ticket, as advised in the previous comments. Using the hyperloop example we gave, the full Collection View API can be used in Titanium applications. And for those who want to stick to a proxy-based solution that already has some predefined API's abstracted, you can stick to the [Ti.CollectionView](<a href="https://github.com/nuno/TiCollectionView)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/nuno/TiCollectionView)</a> implemented by [~mpociot] and nowadays curated by  [~nunocostapt] (great work guys!). Thanks!</li>

    *Important note.*
    
    The original work was done by *Marcel [ <a href="https://github.com/mpociot" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/mpociot</a>] * he passed the module to me for me continue his GREAT work, he had not the time to continue!
    
    I will need all the help possible to keep that module great!</li>
<li>Nuno Costa 2016-11-04

    There are some memory leaks that we can't resolve yet, on issue tracker, all the helps is welcome!

    <a href="https://github.com/nuno/TiCollectionView" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/nuno/TiCollectionView</a> module works so good in iOS but there is little bug in android version and it doesn't works in Vanilla style project (Alloy version it seems works fine).
    Can someone try to solve it? I'm not able to do it.
    
    
    Best regards</li>
