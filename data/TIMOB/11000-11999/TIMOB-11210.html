   This scenario is most likely of no importance for the demo. I'd resolve this as "Won't Fix". Leaving it up to Russ to decide.
   
   FYI, there is a PR with a fix for this. However, we didn't have time to do proper post-commit testing. Therefore, it wasn't committed. Feel free to disregard it if you decide so.</li>

   Windows Hybrid is dead.</li>

   Closing ticket as Windows Hybrid is no longer supported.</li>
