<h3>Description</h3>

/ui/common/baseui/mapview.js uses an iOS-specific Toolbar so that there are no buttons for map controls on Android. The sample should enable the user to select map type (satellite, hybrid, etc.), change map location, and so forth. These need to be implemented as an Android menu or as standard buttons to be cross-platform. 

Sample as written currently will likely also fail on MobileWeb.
