<h3>Description</h3>

Kitchen Sink exists elsewhere now.  Smoke Test was an internal tool used by QE but not any longer.  ApiCheck has only been updated 3 times and the last time was 3 years ago -- no idea what it actually is.

   [~ingo], [~cng] Can we kill the demos folder in titanium_mobile? Isn't KitchenSink in another repo? Do we need it for the iOS team to have something to build from Xcode?</li>
<li>Chee Kiat Ng 2016-08-25

   Yes we need it for the iOS team to build and check changes they made to the SDK. It'll be less efficient if you remove it. Unless we can devise an alternate way to do that so that the SDK can be leaner. Android has such a demo/folder as well.</li>
<li>Ingo Muschenetz 2016-08-25

   [~cng] which of the demos do we actually need? All of them? You could use git submodules to pull in changes. Or make the build script pull the latest from Kitchen Sink.</li>
<li>Chee Kiat Ng 2016-08-25

   yes git submodules is a possible approach.</li>

   Resolving ticket as Invalid as there is now a new version of Kitchen Sink available and we no longer support the version which relates to this ticket.</li>
