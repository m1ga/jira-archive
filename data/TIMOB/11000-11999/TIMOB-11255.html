<h3>Description</h3>

Using the leftTrackImage, rightTrackImage properties for the slider, it does not render correctly on the new iOS6 as can be seen in the attached screen shots.
iOS Simulator Screen shot Sep 24, 2012 8.37.22 PM.png is running iOS6 while iOS Simulator Screen shot Sep 24, 2012 8.37.47 PM.png is iOS 5.1

The default slider renders as it should.

   Able to reproduce on:
   Titanium Studio, build: 2.1.2.201208301612
   Titanium Studio SDK, build:2.1.3.v20120925173111
   Devices:
   iPod iOS6, iPhone simulator 6.0
   Note: able to reproduce with KitchenSink> Controls> Slider> Basic.

   Going to blame this partially on Apple and partially on the developer.
   
   Seems like Apple has a problem resizing stretchable images that are larger than the bounds of the receiver which shows up in IOS6. 
   
   Was able to solve the problem by using smaller images (11x9 WxH). Going to mark this as HOLD </li>
<li>Vishal Duggal 2012-09-26

   Have sent PR to update KS images</li>
<li>Quentin CASACCI 2012-09-30

   Doesn't solve the problem for me here ...
   Tried smaller image, bigger image and image 11x9.
   With a smaller image the image (left) is ok, about 3/4 of the slider, then fill the rest of the slider,
   i think the problem is other than size.
   (Sorry for my english, i'm french).</li>

   Just come here to submit this bug but somebody did it before me...
   How come it is "resolved" tho?</li>
<li>Daniel Sefton 2012-10-01

   Re-opened: Workaround is not working for users, and needs more clarification.</li>
<li>Robert Baumgartner 2012-10-03

   I am seeing similar behaviour as Quentin. If I go with a smaller image (which isn't really an option in my case) it gets somewhat better, but the problem still occurs after maybe 50% of the slider. I hope this gets resolved soon, custom sliders look pretty bad like that.</li>
<li>Quentin CASACCI 2012-10-03

   Yes it's an important problem to solve ! all custom sliders are visible like a nose in full midlle of the face, i hear customers screaming !!! :(</li>

    Titanium SDK, build: 3.0.0.v20121025171611

    iPad3 ios 6.0 </li>

    It's a shame it's not available in earlier releases. We need to wait until December to have this officially available?</li>
