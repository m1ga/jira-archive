<h3>Description</h3>

From a customer, they feel the app is taking up way too memory (RAM) on device.

For a bare-bones app, investigate what takes up each slice of memory size, and then suggests possible ways in which this can be reduced. We will create follow-on tickets to work on size reductions where possible.

   I'm going to mark this as a duplicate of the analysis we did for the related tickets which decreased heap size substantially. If there are additional specific tickets to focus on, please link them here.</li>
