   Need to explain the difference in size.</li>

   @bhughes, would you mind investigating this quickly? It should be simple to confirm it is or is not an issue.</li>

   There were some bugs with copying resources over when this ticket was filed, but those have since been fixed as part of other bugs (sorry, don't know which ones). The remaining difference (about 500k net) is due to valid changes in the mobile web code base.</li>

   Distribution folder sizes do not vary now. Tested with following configuration
   Titanium SDK:3.0.0.v20121207120202 vs 2.1.4GA
   Titanium Â Studio:3.0.0.201211301903</li>
