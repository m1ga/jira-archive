   Reproducible
   Tested on:
   Titanium Studio: 3.0.0.201209171527
   Titanium SDK: 3.0.0.v20120918143313
   OS: OS X 10.8 (Mountain Lion)
   Device Tested: HTC EVO (4.0.3)</li>

   There is no special setup required to get the 'port forward' message, it's just a debugging in device process.
   
   Same comment for TISTUD-2290

   I believe this is a platform issue. The log messages are not available via the debug process. The messages do appear in the log cat through. One thing to note is we follow the same process for connecting to the debug for iOS, and the log messages are available.</li>

   Need TISTUD-2388 in order to work on this.</li>

   Studio will also need to be changed, but we also had to change something to give studio the ability to see the logcat on device.
   
   <h4>Testing Notes</h4>
   
   This is for testing without Studio changes, to "prove" that our new builder.py command named "logcat" (which does nothing other than make the device/emulator's logcat available as a separate process available to Studio) works fine.
   
   <h4>In a Terminal window, run the new builder.py like this:  (You'll need to provide the path to the builder.py of course):</h4>
   <code><pre>
   > builder.py logcat <android_sdk_location> -d
   </pre></code>
   So for me, for example, I run:
   <code><pre>
   > "/Library/Application Support/Titanium/mobilesdk/osx/3.0.0/android/builder.py" logcat /Users/bill/android/android-sdk-macosx -d
   </pre></code>
   <h4>The -d means device.  You could alternatively make it -e for emulator or -s <serial_number_of_device>. </h4>
   <h4>Leave it running.</h4>
   <h4>Use Studio to install an app that contains a <code>Ti.API.info("whatever you want");</code> statement in it on your attached device or running emulator.</h4>
   <h4>Run the app on the device.</h4>
   <h4>Check the terminal window that has logcat running -- it should show the info (or debug or whatever) statement.</h4>
   <h4>Go to a separate Terminal window.</h4>
   <h4>Run <code>ps -e</code> and find the PID of the python process running builder.py with the "devicelog" command.</h4>
   <h4>Run <code>kill -3 [pid]</code>.</h4>
   <h4>Switch back over to the Terminal window where logcat was running.  It should show a message that a signal 3 was received and it was terminated.</h4></li>

   Reopened the wrong ticket</li>

   Bill, this works fine, but can you return the messages from the builder.py process that launched the debug process? Currently studio has to hold on to two processes, one for the install on device and the other for logcat. The install on the device process does not output any messages.</li>
<li>Nam Le 2012-10-11

   On further inspection, the Debug on emulator workflow is very similar, so this is fine</li>
