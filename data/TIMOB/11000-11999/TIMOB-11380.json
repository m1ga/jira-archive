If there is a strong connection you don't notice it.  But when there's a poor connection, it will block UI interaction for a few seconds.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere's the scenario / overview:\r\nUser is in an area without a strong signal -> user taps a table view in a navigation group that opens the next window ->  in the click callback an analytic method is invoked ->  Nothing else in the callback gets invoked until the analytic method finishes.  On a poor connection this took several seconds.  When the analytic code is removed the issue is no longer there.",
