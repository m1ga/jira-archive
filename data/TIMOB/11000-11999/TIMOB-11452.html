<h3>Description</h3>

There's a number of things that are causing this to break. For starters, we simply do not allow bottom, right, and center to be animated. Second, even if we did, we don't query the current bottom, right, or center values properly.

The problem is partly solved by tinkering with the layout engine and part with the animation code. We may need to convert all bottom, right, and center animations to height/top or left/width based animations.

   This should work. The call to calculateAnimation() is what converts center, bottom, and right to left/top coordinates. The animation engine shouldn't be dealing with any position arguments passed in at all. It should only deal with what is returned from caculateAnimation(). It's probably just a bug in calculateAnimation(). Does this affect all layouts, or just composite?</li>
<li>Chris Barber 2012-10-13

   I've only tested composite layouts. While there may be issues in calculateAnimation(), there definitely are issues in the animation go() function where we simply ignore bottom, right, and center properties.</li>

   Resolving as "Won't Fix" as MobileWeb has been deprecated.</li>

   Closing as will not fix.</li>
