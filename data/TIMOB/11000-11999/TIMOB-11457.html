   Attached videos of me using it successfully in Android 3.2 (LG Slate) and Android 2.2 (HTC Desire) (I don't have ICS, only Jelly Bean, 3.2 and 2.2). </li>

   The code above does not work on Samsung Galaxy Tab (v3.2) with Talk Back ON and Eyes Free Keyboard. Also does not work on Galaxy Nexus (v4.0.4) and HTC Desire V (v4.0.3).</li>

   @Ingo: I guess someone in the office with access to a Galaxy Tab running 3.2, and a Galaxy Nexus with 4.0.4 or Desire V with v4.0.3 will need to confirm and work on this.</li>

   I'm sorry, apparently you need the latest version of TalkBack from the Play Store for this to work.  I apparently installed that on my older devices while I was first working on this, but I forgot about it.
   
   Satyam could you do that and try again?  Thank you.
   
   I will also update documentation and submit a documentation Pull Request for this ticket, so please keep this open even if you find out that it works.</li>

   Checked the issue with updated version of Talk Back. The issue does not exist after updating the Talk Back on Samsung Galaxy Tab (v3.2) and Galaxy Nexus (v4.0.4).</li>

   Needed the latest version of talkback for this to work.</li>
<li>Paras Mishra 2013-04-18

   Working as expected with latest talkback installed on device and cannot reproduce issue. Hence closing the issue.
   
   Verified on:
   Device: Samsung Galaxy Note, Android version: 2.3.6
   SDK: 3.1.0.GA
   CLI version : 3.1.0-cr
   OS : MAC OSX 10.7.5
   Titanium Studio, build: 3.1.0.201304151600
   XCode : 4.5.1</li>
