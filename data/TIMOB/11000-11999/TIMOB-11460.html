   Works fine for me on 3.1 (LG Slate) and 2.2 (Desire).  Video attached.  Would be weird if it worked on 3.2 and 4.1 but not 4.0.  I don't have ICS so I can't test.
   
   note that on 3.X and lower, you'll need a device that has D-PAD keys (or equivalent), or the "Eyes Free Keyboard" to test this stuff (you have to have some way to bring focus to the controls since these Android versions don't have explore-by-touch.):

   Works fine on Android 3.2 (Samsung Galaxy Tab) with Eyes Free Keyboard. However, on ICS device with Talk back and Explore By Touch ON, the accessibility does not work for picker.</li>
<li>Bill Dawson 2012-10-18

   @Ingo: I guess someone in the office with access to an ICS device and a Galaxy Tab running 3.2 will need to confirm and work on this.</li>

   Allen Yeung also tried with ICS and it didn't work.  But after installing Google's latest TalkBack from the Google Play Store, it does work.  Can you try that Satyam?  Thank you.</li>
<li>Satyam Sekhri 2012-11-07

   The issue does not exist after installing the latest Talk Back from Google Play Store.</li>
<li>Allen Yeung 2012-12-03

   Works after installing latest version of talkback</li>

   Accessibility does not work for Picker 
   Tested on:
   Android Version : 4.0.4
   SDK: 3.1.0.v20130327135307
   CLI version : 3.0.25-alpha
   OS : MAC OSX 10.8.2
   
   Steps to reproduce:
   1. Run Acceptance Access_1106 on Accessibility module.
   2. Touch the second picker (with LVH defined in sequence) 
   
   Expected:
   The device reads aloud the LVH - (Picker2 label , Picker2 value , Picker2 hint) 
   
   Actual:
   Device Just Read "alert Accessibility_module"
   </li>
<li>Allen Yeung 2013-04-01

   This works fine on a 4.X device and a 2.3 device.  For a 2.3 device, you need to install and use the eyes free keyboard app.
   
   Make sure you also have the latest version of talkback installed.</li>
