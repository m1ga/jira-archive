   Chris, what is the GUID used by the new CLI?</li>
<li>Chris Barber 2012-10-16

   @Ingo, cf5c67ed-1c3b-494b-afe0-01b958ef0f40.</li>
<li>Nika Jones 2012-10-16

   Is this in production or UAT?</li>
<li>Ingo Muschenetz 2012-10-16

   I believe this is production. Natalie can you confirm?</li>
<li>Chris Barber 2012-10-16

   No, Chung gave it to me. I have no clue how he created it.</li>
<li>Natalie Huynh 2012-10-16

   Here is GUID of the app that was created by CLI <guid>0af26ae6-1b62-4006-b42d-7762b8427125</guid></li>

   Natalie:
   
   Would it be possible to run this on staging? I need to see the full Request/Response cycle, which is difficult to do in Production.</li>
<li>Natalie Huynh 2012-10-17

   Here is the guid created in staging: <guid>693e26f4-4504-45c7-ab0e-06b7e4066e8e</guid>

    Tested with 3.0.0.v20121017192538 with CLI 3.0.6, creating the application in staging and production does not display on the my apps page. Guid below:
    Live: <guid>42afbf52-c520-4921-9cf4-8e27f143f8e0</guid>
    Stage: <guid>3b589c9b-7a77-4d09-b37d-a837364b85ab</guid></li>

    I was unable to reproduce in this environment:
    
    Titanium Studio: 3.0.0.201210172118
    Titanium SDK: 3.0.0.v20121017192538
    Titanium CLI: 3.0.6
    Node.ACS: 0.9.21
    GUID: a64548d2-94a2-4916-8d39-073d8124f895</li>
<li>Natalie Huynh 2012-10-18

    I can see the application when I create it in Studio, but from terminal running it in command line I do not see the application</li>
<li>Ingo Muschenetz 2012-10-19

    Nika: We want to push a developer preview tomorrow. Is there something Chris _has_ to do on his end before then, or can we make this work with tweaking the cloud side?
    </li>
<li>Nika Jones 2012-10-19

    @ingo - That's the deal. I'm not sure how the sessions and cookies stuff is working. So I don't know if it's something that I can fix, or if Chris does. Let me see if I can inspect the cookie passing. If that's not coming through. Then I suspect Chris will need to make some changes for that to happen.</li>
<li>Ingo Muschenetz 2012-10-19

    @Nika: Thanks. Please let us know ASAP.</li>
<li>Chris Barber 2012-10-19

    I verified that the CLI is NOT passing the cookie for analytics calls and that the data "type" was "app" instead of "mobile". Both have been fixed and are pending code review.</li>
<li>Nika Jones 2012-10-19

    @ingo I'd like to verify that users do NOT have to be logged in to use the CLI.</li>
<li>Natalie Huynh 2012-10-19

    @Nika, you have to be logged in to create an app through CLI, before the app is created you are asked for pwd to login.</li>
<li>Chris Barber 2012-10-19

    I think I fixed it on my end. There was a typo and it's fixed and pushed. CI builds are running.</li>
<li>Eric Merriman  2012-10-20

    looks fixed to me.
    Titanium CLI: 3.0.8
    Titanium Studio, build: 3.0.0.201210191411
    SDK: 3.0.0.v20121019153308</li>
<li>Natalie Huynh 2012-11-15

    Tested with 3.0.16 and 3.0.0.v20121113170203</li>
