<h3>Description</h3>

Right now, event listeners are parsed like any other callback passed to a Ti API function. We should do something more advanced like pre-populating the event object and, if possible, even running it with the actual values in e. For example, if a button has a click event handler, we can set e.source.

We will need to be careful though to make sure that the values are invariant before setting them in e.

Note: this issue is colloquially referred to as the "Kitchen Sink Problem" because it was first surface, and severely affects, Kitchen Sink.
