<h3>Description</h3>

Until 2.1.3.GA (ex 2.1.2) when you generate an AdHoc build, it came with the DSYM file builtin on the ipa.

Generating an ipa with the latest 2.1.3.GA version with min-ios-ver 5.0 don't generate the DSYM file anymore.

Specs on my tiapp.xml:

<code><pre>
&lt;ios&gt;
    &lt;ios-version&gt;6.0&lt;/ios-version&gt;
    &lt;min-ios-ver&gt;5.0&lt;/min-ios-ver&gt;
&lt;/ios&gt;
</pre></code>

   Cannot get DSYM packaged with 2.1.2 and Xcode 4.4 or 4.5
   Forwarding to QA for validation.</li>
<li>Natalie Huynh 2012-10-17

   Tested with Studio 2.1.2 with SDk 2.1.2 with xcode 4.4 on Mac 10.7.5. Do not see the DSYM in the package</li>
<li>Max Stepanov 2012-10-17

   DSYM files are generated but has never been packaged into IPA file.</li>
<li>Ygor Lemos 2012-10-17

   Yes it was, I have submitted hundred of builds to Testflight, generated on TiStudio and they've always got packaged inside the ipa files automatically. It stopped after last 2.1.3.GA update.
   
   I have all my previous builds with the DSYM files embedded automatically by TiStudio.
   
   This is not invalid.

<li>Ygor Lemos 2012-10-17

   Perhaps it is something with TiStudio? (an extra step that embedded DSYM files previously and now it doesn't ?</li>
<li>Max Stepanov 2012-10-17

   Ygor, could you provide an internal structure of your ipa file ? Rename it to zip and unpack.</li>
<li>Max Stepanov 2012-10-17

   Ygor, how did you submit builds to TestFlight ?</li>
<li>Ygor Lemos 2012-10-17

   Max, I've submitted them using the Testflight Mac client. (some of them using the web app).
   
   I have noticed that all builds built for "iOS 4.0 +" have the embedded DSYM file.
   
   All builds for "iOS 5.0 +" don't have the DSYM file. Guess it have something to do with the minimum iOS version!?</li>
<li>Max Stepanov 2012-10-17

   Ygor, it might be something Xcode package utility did for earlier SDK versions.
   If you will look at <project>/build/iphone/build/ you will see that DSYM is located next to ipa file.
   What was you previous Xcode version ? I tried 4.4 and DSYM is still not packaged.</li>
<li>Ygor Lemos 2012-10-17

    I believe it was 4.4.1
    
    So, for now if I want DSYM files on AdHoc builds I will need to generate the ipa, uncompress it, embed the file and recompress it?</li>
<li>Max Stepanov 2012-10-17

    Ygor, per TestFlight docs DSYM file is uploaded separately.

    It seems to be an Testflight problem and they are aware of it... their Mac App used to upload DSYMS automatically... sorry about this bug.

    Hi Ygor,
    
    Sorry you're having this trouble. We've had other reports like this, so we'll be investigating. For now, you should be able to upload your dSYM on the corresponding Crashes page on the TestFlight web site.
    
    Thank you for your patience and sorry for the interruption.
