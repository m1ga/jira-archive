<h3>Description</h3>

When created in a new-style tab group, the video appears briefly, then disappears. Audio is still audible.

Probably related to the activity handling for video player and the new-style tab group.

   When I was cleaning up the test case, I realized that this was user error--the test app I plugged this into had something else going on. It was actually opening up another window, but because of the action bar theme, it wasn't apparent that there was a new window in place.</li>
