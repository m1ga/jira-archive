<h3>Description</h3>

The playbackstate event has a property named playbackState. However, on Android, when the event was renamed from playbackState to playbackstate, the event *property* was renamed as well.

The property name should stay the same, as it is documented, as it worked on Android in 2.1.3, and as it works in iOS in 3.0.

   This is a regression as well, since the property was renamed in both the legacy playbackState and the new playbackstate events.</li>

   For FR, please run KS->Phone->Play Movie->Local and check the log in the console. Should see something like:
   <code><pre>
   I/TiAPI   ( 3788):  Event PlaybackState Fired: 1
   </pre></code>
   Without the fix, the log is:
   <code><pre>
   I/TiAPI   ( 4401):  Event PlaybackState Fired: undefined
   </pre></code></li>
