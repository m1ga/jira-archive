<h3>Description</h3>

If no connection(behind proxy and proxy not set for example) i cant even build my app

By the way it way mention in bold that every build is logged and sent to Appcelerator!
Personally i dont really like that, and will disable it. 
Also we MUST be able to build without connection or behind a proxy.

   Why does it say Status Resolved? I have latest Titanium and I can't start it without Internet connection, and if I connect and start it and then disconnect and try to build it doesn't work either. Why do we have to be connected? Can't we develope when we aren't at home?</li>

   @Javier, this ticket is resolved because the bug above was fixed. There have since been other bugs related to not being able to build without an internet connection. All of those bugs have been fixed and will be in the next upcoming release.
   
   FWIW, if you run "titanium login" at the command line, you will be logged in forever. So, just login at the command line when you hop online and you should be good to go.</li>

   Closing ticket as fixed.</li>
