On the other hand, if I launch the app in portrait, only the icon is displayed, even when I rotate into landscape.\r\n\r\nOn a related topic, the app icon is displayed larger when I launch in landscape mode. It appears that we use two different sizes, one for the stacked action bar and one for the ordinary portrait-mode action bar. I'm not sure if this behavior is correct in the first place--I can't see a reference to it in the Android docs. However, both versions seem to be scaled differently based on whether it's launched in portrait or landscape, which is definitely wrong.\r\n",

If you launch in landscape, you ALWAYS have the text, if you launch in portrait, you NEVER have the text. So it seems like there's something that we need to refresh when we change orientations (or else this is a bug in Android).\n\nTesting the built-in Google apps, NONE of them seem to follow the documented behavior. Settings, Notes, Gmail--wherever they use text with action items, they seem to use it consistently in both landscape and portrait. Maybe it'd be different on a different device, but it doesn't seem like they're following their own design guidelines.",

					"body": "OK, so for those viewers playing at home, here's the lowdown. The switching DOES work, in the following cases:\n\nBoth the <application> element and the launcher activity have to be declared with an action bar theme, such as \"@android:style/Theme.Holo\".\n\nTiActivity (and possibly also TiTranslucentActivity) need to be set to *not* handle the screenSize config change, like so:\n\n{code}\n<activity android:configChanges=\"keyboardHidden|orientation\" android:name=\"org.appcelerator.titanium.TiActivity\"/>\n{code}\n\nThis results in Android restarting the activity on orientation change. The bad news: this results in the original window being torn down and recreated, with a noticeable pause during which you can see whatever was under the current window (the desktop, another app, etc). I don't think we can recommend this course of action to users; it's a terrible user experience, and it occurs whether the app is native or Titanium.\n\nSo I'm going to create a new doc ticket recommending that users do *not* use SHOW_AS_ACTION_WITH_TEXT, but instead create an actionView if they want to display both text and icon. \n\nIf the application is inherently portrait-only or landscape-only, they can safely use SHOW_AS_ACTION_WITH_TEXT -- but otherwise the user experience is unacceptable.\n\nThe interesting thing is that showAsAction: SHOW_AS_ACTION_IF_ROOM is recalculated on reorientation--that is, the number of action items shown changes when moving from portrait to landscape and back.\n",
