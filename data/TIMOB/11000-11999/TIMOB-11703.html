   Martin,
   
   right now only one .js file can be included for each module, so you won't be able to include all your .js assets.
   
   However I'm moving this ticket to a feature request for engineering - keep a watch to it for any update.</li>

   Thanks that s exactly what i wanted. I know that developers are the first clients of Appcelerator. And for us developer, protecting our work is a great concern.
   
   I will also create another ticket about a related problem: i think that when releasing an app on android, js files are include like so and can be read by anyone who unzip the package.
   
   Thanks Federico </li>
