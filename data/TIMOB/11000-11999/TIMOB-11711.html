   This seems like an unintentional behavior that Apple was giving out to the users,( un-pinching to bring the movie to fullscreen and pinching to bring it back). This was causing some problem amongst the users, so they have decided to remove this unintentional behavior from iOS 6.0. There are somewhat similar discussion about this problem in Apple developer forum. 
   
   Marking ticket as not our bug. </li>
