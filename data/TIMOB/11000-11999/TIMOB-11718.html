<h3>Description</h3>

We should create a mechanism for debugging apps being run in the code processor in a similar vein to how V8 has a debugger. It would (probably) be a client-server architecture like V8 and would allow some sort of GUI debugger (in studio?) to connect. This would allow end user's to debug their code in a general manner without having to deploy to a specific device (or even platform). It could also allow us to do things like interactive code analysis, execution analysis, and other really cool things.
