<h3>Description</h3>

Description:
Clicking on the comment, photo, button, date, user and calendar does not update the clicked row with label "You clicked on the ...". In the console info "TiAPI table view row clicked - source [object ...]"  does not appear as well. Only clicking on the row returns expected result.

This is a regression, does not occur on 2.1.4.

Steps:
1. Run KitchenSink from the developer relations.
2. Go to Base UI - Views - Table Views - Table View (Layout 2)
3. Click on different parts of the row (e.g. photo, date, calendar, comment e.t.c.)

Expected:
Each click should update the row with 'you clicked on the <user, comment, date or calendar>.
On the console appropriate info should be displayed.

Actual:
Clicking on different parts of the row does not update the clicked row and appropriate indo does not appear in the console.
