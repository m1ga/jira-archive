<h3>Description</h3>

The app builds for iOS correctly, but cannot get it to build for Android. The following messages are seen in console when tried to build for Android:
<code><pre>
[INFO] logfile = /Users/norton/Development/BUCA/src/client/Titanium_Studio_Workspace/Back-Up Care/build.log

</pre></code>

It worked fine for a while building for Android 2.2.0.  After that when tried to buil for 4.0.3 and 4.1.0 and started to get the error above.  When tried to go back to 2.2.0, that stopped working as well.The files are imported from TFS.

   Unable to reproduce using Titanium SDK 3.1.1.GA. I made the entire resources folder read only and it worked just fine. The only thing I could possibly see is if the build dir was read only. I can add check for that in the Android tooling rewrite, but in general, the build dir should not be versioned.</li>

   Apparently the issue was the tiapp.xml was read only. Still unable to reproduce with the new Android build.</li>

   Closing ticket as the issue cannot be reproduced and due to the above comments.</li>
