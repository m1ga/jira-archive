<h3>Description</h3>

As part of our goal to determine code coverage, we wish to generate Mocha tests for the complete Titanium Mobile API.

Note that many of these tests might exercise UI components, and mocha is non-visual. This is acceptable--we merely want the Mocha test her to confirm that there isn't an exception being thrown by the code, not that the result is actually graphically correct. We will use a different mechanism (likely something like SOASTA) for that path.

* Given a pointer to either the source code or some documentation for a platform, generate a suite of Mocha tests that exercises the APIs using a permutation of common parameters.
* If parameter values are complex (i.e. they require setup, like creating a window or other such item), allow for a way to create dummy objects, perhaps with some helper methods in a referenced library
* The end result of the generation will be a set of files suitable for checking into source control.
* The tool should be able to be re-run against the API from time to time to generate new tests as new APIs are added. The existing tests should be commented or noted in such a way so that the new tests can be added to the existing files

   This sounds like vapor.</li>

   It's actually not. We should be able to generate a test scaffold from our existing documentation. It should be mocha tests instead, but same idea.</li>
