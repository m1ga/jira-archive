   I also saw that issue when testing a PR. The installation stucks when there is an alert popping up on the device screen. If I dismiss that alert, "[INFO] Application installed. Launch from drawer on Home Screen" will show. It seems only happens on 4.2 device.</li>

   I haven't seen this.  So:
   
   a) Happens only if device on standby?
   b) Anybody know what the message says? (the alert on the screen)
   
   Sorry, I'm away from my desk for a while.  Maybe you can re-create, Ping?</li>

   No it also happens when the device has a logged in user, it just hangs and the application never gets installed to the device. Only seeing this on the Nexus 10, I am able to install to Nexus 7

   Device issue, did a reset and no longer encounter this problem</li>

   Hmm, but Ping saw it too.  Worries me a bit.</li>

   I saw this problem on Nexus 7 and Nexus 10 (both are 4.2). The installation stucks on [INFO] Installing application on device and at the same time an alert pops up on the device screen saying something like:
   {quote}
   Google needs to verify the app to be installed.
   Disagree or Agree"
   {quote}
   If I click "Disagree", the alert will show again next time when I try to install app from studio. If I click "Agree", the alert will never show again. No matter I disagree or agree, the installation will continue and complete successfully with the log [INFO] Application installed. Launch from drawer on Home Screen .</li>
