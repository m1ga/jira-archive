<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Steps to Reproduce</h4>
iOS 6 has opened up the UICollectionView as new element for displaying data collections to users. 

Would really be a solid enhancement over our abstracted DashboardView and falls into the 'Native Element' category.

<h4>Actual Result</h4>
Doesn't exist today in Titanium outside of custom modules

<h4>Expected Result</h4>
This should exist under Ti.UI.iOS as an accessible ui element

   Additionally - it would be very cool to correspond this component to the Android's GridView component - if that was done it could be abstracted back out to the top level Ti.UI object.
   
   This would be VERY useful for ui layouts.
