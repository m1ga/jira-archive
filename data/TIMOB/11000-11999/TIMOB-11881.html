<h4>Steps to reproduce</h4>
1. Install and run Codestrong 2012 app on Android,

   when closing the tester needs to confirm behavior on 4.2 device with multiple users</li>

   I've tried running this with KS on two phones, both on 2.1.3.GA, and the /Android/data/com.appcelerator.kitchensink directory gets removed whenever I uninstall.
   
   Marking as cannot reproduce for now.  If you could get an isolated test case (or app) and device details that would be great.  I can't use the code strong app since the repo doesn't have the correct tiapp.xml associated with it.</li>

   Can you summarize details the two Devices (physical device model) and OS version?</li>
