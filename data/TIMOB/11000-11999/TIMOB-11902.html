<h3>Description</h3>

Similar to ANT, we'd like a mechanism whereby individuals can supply a separate file for build-time properties and these would replace variables during the compilation step.

A good use case for this might be the secret keys in ACS. We'd like to not store them in tiapp.xml, and instead have a separate build.properties file that contains the key/value pairs. This file would then get a .gitignore, so we don't accidentally check it into source control.

An example:

{panel:title=tiapp.xml}
<propertyname="acs-oauth-secret-production"type="string">$\{acs-oauth-secret-production\}</property>
{panel}

{panel:title=build.properties}
acs-oauth-secret-production=XXYYZZ
{panel}

There would need to be some way to indicate which file contained the properties.

   This is brilliant!
   
   We currently required users to pass in their provisioning profile uuid, developer cert name, and dist cert name to the build command. It rarely changes, so it would be better to put this in a file. We can't use the <code>tiapp.xml</code> since apps could be developed by a team of people, each with different developer certs and such.
   
   I don't like the idea of a key/value file. I think it needs to be hierarchical. I don't think JSON would work since it doesn't allow comments and requires extra work to define a schema.
   
   If we had a <code>user.xml</code> that shared a similar structure to the <code>tiapp.xml</code>, then we could <code>.gitignore</code> that one file and essentially have the build "merge" the <code>user.xml</code> on top of the <code>tiapp.xml</code>.
   
   To make managing this file easier, we could whip up a quick <code>ti setup</code> screen for selecting their provisioning profile uuid, etc.
   
   Studio would have to get creative. It could simply load the <code>user.xml</code> in the tiapp editor, but with a much looser schema.</li>
