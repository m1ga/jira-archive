We'd like to not store them in tiapp.xml, and instead have a separate build.properties file that contains the key/value pairs. This file would then get a .gitignore, so we don't accidentally check it into source control.\r\n\r\nAn example:\r\n\r\n{panel:title=tiapp.xml}\r\n<propertyname=\"acs-oauth-secret-production\"type=\"string\">$\\{acs-oauth-secret-production\\}</property>\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\n{panel:title=build.properties}\r\nacs-oauth-secret-production=XXYYZZ\r\n{panel}\r\n\r\nThere would need to be some way to indicate which file contained the properties.",

It rarely changes, so it would be better to put this in a file. We can't use the {{tiapp.xml}} since apps could be developed by a team of people, each with different developer certs and such.\r\n\r\nI don't like the idea of a key/value file. I think it needs to be hierarchical. I don't think JSON would work since it doesn't allow comments and requires extra work to define a schema.\r\n\r\nIf we had a {{user.xml}} that shared a similar structure to the {{tiapp.xml}}, then we could {{.gitignore}} that one file and essentially have the build \"merge\" the {{user.xml}} on top of the {{tiapp.xml}}.\r\n\r\nTo make managing this file easier, we could whip up a quick {{ti setup}} screen for selecting their provisioning profile uuid, etc.\r\n\r\nStudio would have to get creative. It could simply load the {{user.xml}} in the tiapp editor, but with a much looser schema.",
