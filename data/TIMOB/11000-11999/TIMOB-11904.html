<h3>Description</h3>

Log messages are not logged for Minimum ios version mentioned in Tiapp.xml. There is no info of the version used.
This is regression since the issue does not occur in 2.1.4 GA.

Steps to reproduce:
1) Create a project in Studio with an iOS target
2) Edit the tiapp.xml to include the following and save the changes:
<ios>
<min-ios-ver>3.2</min-ios-ver>
</ios>
3) Build the project for any version iOS simulator and observe logs

Expected results:
The following appears in the log:
[INFO] Minimum iOS version 3.2 is lower than 4.3: Using 4.3 as minimum
[INFO] Minimum iOS version: 4.3

Actual:
Building for iOS 6.0; using 4.3 as minimum iOS version

   Tested with the same SDK and Titanium Studio, build: 3.0.0.201211291910 and I am seeing:
   [INFO] Minimum iOS version 3.2 is lower than 4.0: Using 4.3 as minimum
   [INFO] Minimum iOS version: 4.3 Linked iOS Version 6.0

   Not repro on any other machines, Anshu please work with Satyam to get this achine into a workable state, or reproduce this issue on a second machine and re-open. thanks.</li>

   The issue is reproducible at our end on 3.0 SDK build and works fine on 2.1.4 SDK. Tried the same scenario on couple of more systems with same environment and could reproduce on one of those as well.
   Note: On both the system on which the issue occurs, when we run the project on iOS simulator using the 3.0 SDK build the console has a title "Titanium iPhone Simulator - testapp1 [Titanium iOS Simulator] iOS build and deploy" whereas on 2.1.4 SDK the console has a title "Titanium iPhone Simulator - testapp1 [Titanium iOS Simulator] iOS Simulator".</li>

   Thanks for the update Anshu!</li>

   This is the expected functionality. The minimum iOS version is used in conjunction with the iOS SDK to determine the architecture targets to compile for. If someone, puts an irrational min-ios-ver, the build scripts will correct it.</li>
<li>Ingo Muschenetz 2012-12-03

   @Chris, the issue is that in the old SDK, it appears to be notifying the user that the correction has occurred. Is it still doing the same in the new CLI? It's a useful message.</li>
<li>Chris Barber 2012-12-03

   @Ingo, yes, it detects various settings and will display a useful message.
   
   If the iOS SDK version is >= 6.0 AND the min-ios-ver is < 4.3, then it forces the min-ios-ver to 4.3 and prints "Building for iOS 6.0; using 4.3 as minimum iOS version".
   
   If the min-ios-ver is < 4.0, then it forces the min-ios-ver to 4.0 and prints "The min-ios-ver of the iOS section in the tiapp.xml is lower than minimum supported version: Using 4.0 as minimum".
   
   If the min-ios-ver is > the iOS SDK version, then it forces the min-ios-ver to the specified iOS SDK version and prints "The min-ios-ver of the iOS section in the tiapp.xml is greater than the specified ios-version: Using <IOS SDK VERSION> as minimum".</li>
