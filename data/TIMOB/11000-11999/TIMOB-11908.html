<h3>Description</h3>

We can make the analysis coverage plugin much more useful by doing the following:
* Report nodes skipped (i.e. nodes that we knowingly did not process). This will make it easier to determine which nodes were not analyzed improperly
* Create document maps that show what was and what was not analyzed for easy visualization.
* Determine and report which files were not analyzed that had the possibility of being analyzed (i.e. files not in Resources/<platform not being analyzed>)

This should help considerably in dealing with situations where the code processor is not analyzing code for no apparent reason
