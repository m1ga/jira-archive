<h3>Description</h3>

As far as I know, right now, the CLI does not give a distinction between iPhone and iPad during a universal build. It would be ideal if we could make this distinction at compile time. If we were able to make this distinction for all iOS builds, Alloy would be able to further improve the runtime performance of apps by eliminating unnecessary platform conditionals at runtime. Ideally this distinction would be available as a parameter that could be used in the Alloy hook into the CLI process.

This is already done for Android, iOS, and Mobileweb for all <code>Ti.Platform.name</code> conditional checks. If we were able to make the above distinction, we could do the same for all <code>Ti.Platform.osname</code> conditionals on iOS, just as we do now for Android and Mobileweb.

   By definition, universal builds can be either iPhone or iPad. At compile time, there is no way to know if the app is going to be run on iPhone or iPad. You'll have to add platform specific checks in the Alloy runtime code.</li>

   I figured as much. Just wondering if you knew some voodoo with the build process I didn't. Thanks.</li>
