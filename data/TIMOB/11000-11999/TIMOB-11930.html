<h3>Description</h3>

Scripts must have Project Name be at root of bb project. This is studio default but by changing default location in Studio I can have the folder root name be different then project name. This will cause scripts will fail without description

   Address the issue when the python build scripts are updated to the new javascript build system</li>

   Why was this reopened? The app name is taken from tiapp.xml and project name is what is passed in during "ti create" they are no longer coupled. If there are is still problems please describe the problem and put in a simple test case.</li>
