<h3>Description</h3>

When trying to determine why a piece of code was not analyzed, it is almost always necessary to see if we are in an ambiguous context/block and if values are unknown. Currently, one must debug the code processor itself to determine this information. We should create some way of reporting this information via a plugin. Simply dumping to the screen may be information overload though, so we should consider alternative ways of reporting this information, such as writing the source code to file with some sort of annotation.

   Upped the time estimate because uglify's endline/column markers are broken and I now have to write my own AST serializer. It's not a bad thing though because it's something we will need later anyways.</li>
