   A few key tasks to support v2:
   
       - Fragments (TiUIFragment base class that supports fragment based views. SupportMapFragment)
       - Change TiBaseActivity to extend from FragmentActivity to support fragments.
       - Package apps w/ Google Play SDK. (add jar to dex list)
       - Remove old API keys code and tiappxml properties. Keys are now listed in Android manifest section.</li>

   There is also a memory leak caused by the new Maps library I saw during testing: <a href="https://code.google.com/p/gmaps-api-issues/issues/detail?id=4766" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://code.google.com/p/gmaps-api-issues/issues/detail?id=4766</a>
   Hopefully Google patches it before v1 is turned off, as the leak seems to be pretty large.</li>

   Closing ticket as the issue has been fixed.</li>
