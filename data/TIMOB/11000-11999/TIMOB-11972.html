<h3>Description</h3>

*Note* This issue did not occur using SDK 2.1.4.GA
*Note* I am the first QE member to encounter this issue
*Note* I also have multiple certificates in my keychain with the same name

Steps to reproduce
1. Create a new single window application in Studio
2. Build for iOS device
3. Allow codesign to use key

Actual result:
During compilation a modal alert is displayed *See screenshot* that wants codesign to use "<key>". The build succeeds but then fails to install to device.

log attached

Expected result:
Codesign finds the right key, and I am able to successfully install to device

   The problem was due to Mike's computer not having the latest CLI, SDK, and Studio versions.
   
   Ultimately it was because of the --developer-name option was only passing in the name and not the name AND id. Things worked as expected from the command line.</li>

   Just to be clear, I didn't have the studio build from Jenkins. I had to correct studio RC build from preview.appcelerator.com</li>
