		"description": "See TIMOB-11282 for the test case here.\r\n\r\nThere is additional room for optimization over what was done in\r\nthat ticket.   \r\n\r\nCaching the resized images would be of benefit -- they are not\r\ncurrently cached, and resized by AsyncTasks as needed.\r\nIn the cace of TIMOB-11282 the resized images were only a few K \r\nbytes each, and they all would have fit into a fairly small cache\r\n(under 100 KB in that case).  It's probably best to pick a \r\nmaximum cache size and manage by the bytes used in the cache.\r\n\r\nThe images retrieved from the internet are cached in the full size,\r\nthen later on they are resized as needed.  That cache is shared with\r\nother components, so it can be kept and another layer of caching for\r\nthe resized images can be added on top of it.\r\n\r\nIt's possible that a better use of threads can be made in image handling.\r\nThe UI thread may still be doing more work than needed right now.  The\r\npath through the other various AsyncTasks and threads may not be as\r\nefficient as it could be.\r\n\r\nIf the work done on this ticket does not resolve the issue completely,\r\nplease create another Jira ticket with remaining work items listed.\r\n\r\n",
