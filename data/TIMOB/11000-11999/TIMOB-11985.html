   After investigating the crash log, the problem seems to be with TiProxy.m
   
   'TiProxy.m' line 788, column 2 where there is ENSURE_TYPE(listener,KrollCallback);</li>

   I tired using titanium SDK 3.0 Beta 2 as i saw in another issue that someone had the same problem, and the app did not crash anymore in the same way. It opened with the splash screen remaining open. In the organiser console it gave a syntax error and thus a module was not created properly. 
   The syntax error appeared to be in the following file indicating line 60: <a href="https://github.com/iamyellow/tiws/blob/master/android/example/socket.io.js" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/iamyellow/tiws/blob/master/android/example/socket.io.js</a>
   
   Now the funny thing is that there are no syntax errors, and in development it compiles correctly. Could it be something in the way Titanium interprets this js module? </li>

   Hope this is the correct forum for this, but I can confirm my app is crashing when iTunes tests it. see error logs here:

   created with TI 2.1.4GA
   This is a critical issue for me as none of my apps can now get approved. Thanks!</li>

   @Michael,
   is it possible that somewhere in the code you addListener with something other than a function ?</li>

   @David,
   Please create a separate ticket and provide details about your apps. Thanks!</li>
