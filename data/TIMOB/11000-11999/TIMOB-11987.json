But changing it now means a lot of work, and possible regressions. I do think that it is a matter that should be looked at right away as tableview is one of the most commonly used widget in apps.\nAlso know that Appcelerator is working on getting it a little quicker (This is not the right solution and shouldnt be the definitive solution though).A [pull request|https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/3260] has just been pulled to fix a regression appeared in 2.1.3\n\nI should also mention that things are going so much better on android! I havent had the time to go deep into the android code (keep in mind that that the tableview code is pretty complex) but will try and see the difference.",

For example you dont really know when you can start playing with the proxy objects.

COnsequently my approach isnt really necessary.\r\nWhat we need is for views NOT to be created in the setData but to be created/added in the \"cellForRowAtIndexPath\" method of the iOS tableview. That way loading gets crazily faster (well not crazily fast though). \r\nThat's actually what the android implementation does",
