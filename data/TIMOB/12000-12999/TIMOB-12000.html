<h3>Description</h3>

Although support for the "runOnUiThread" annotation element was apparently removed in release 1.8.0.1, it is still used in a number of places in the platform code.

At the best, this is misleading. At the worst, it may be used in places that actually _should_ be invoked on the UI thread. It may also lead community members or module developers to use this element in their own code.
