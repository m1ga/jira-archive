<h3>Description</h3>

Since "iphone", "ipad", and "ios" all do the same thing, it's best to remove "iphone" and "ipad" to remove confusion. Use the device targets in the tiapp.xml or --device-family option to specify "iphone", "ipad", or "universal".

   Running "Titanium build -p iphone -F ipad" 
   builds the project.
   It still accepts platform argument as iphone,ipad for platform options and successfully  build the project.
   As the iphone,ipad options are not removed from platform argument.
   
   If we run "Titanium build"
   it prompts as " Target platform [android,ios,mobileweb]:"
   If User provide iphone,ipad option to it then also it builds successfully.

   This is expected behavior. Nowhere does the CLI advertise that "iphone" or "ipad" are valid build targets, but for a period of time we did allow them. This ticket exists because it doesn't make sense to have "iphone", "ipad", and "ios" targets that are all identical. Too confusing.
   
   The reason we still allow "iphone" and "ipad" is because there are versions of Titanium Studio that may still be in use that pass in "iphone" or "ipad" instead of "ios".
   
   Someday we'll rip out support for "iphone" and "ipad", but it doesn't hurt anything to leave it in.</li>
