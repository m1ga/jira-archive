<h3>Description</h3>

This is NOT a 3.0.X bug -- it's very likely to have been introduced
with changes for TIMOB-11282.

See TIMOB-8708 for the test case here.

Steps to reproduce:

(1) Modify the app in TIMOB-8708 so images are 200 x 200.

(2) You'll need a large number of contacts, 100 is good, probably
    40 would be enough.


(3) Run the app.  Kick scroll to move the table
    quickly.   You need to move the table fast enough that
    a few screens scroll by.


(4) Notice that images shown are now blank.

Actual results:  Images are blank

Expected result:  Images show pictures of contacts

   I'm seeing this with remote images on Android, in custom rows. With images in local files the performance is much better - but still not great. The issue with the remote images is not the load time - but rather that the images go blank when scrolled off screen and then slowly go back into view as scrolled back quickly.
   Perhaps related - I'm often seeing images swapped with other images, for images in local files.... </li>
