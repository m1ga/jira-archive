<h3>Description</h3>

The same KitchenSink application has two separate instances in iTunes/Device when build with 3.0.0 SDK and any prior GA SDK (like 2.1.3 GA or 2.1.4 GA). The KitchenSink app's TiApp.xml defines app version as 2.1.3.GA. However, when app is build with SDK 2.1.3.GA or 2.1.4.GA the ipa file in itunes shows the version as 2.1.3, whereas when build with SDK 3.0.0 the version is 2.0

This is a regression. The issue does not occur with 2.1.4 GA, as it replaces the app build with 2.1.3 GA

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Get the KitchenSink from 3_0_X branch of <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator-developer-relations/KitchenSink" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator-developer-relations/KitchenSink</a>
2. Choose to install the application on iOS device with SDK 3.0.0
3. Again, try to install the same app (without any change) on iOS device with 2.1.4.GA

Actual:
Two instances of KitchenSink app are installed on iOS device

Expected:
On installing the same app with different version of titanium SDK, the previous one should get replaced.

   Chris, I think this might be a CLI issue.</li>

   This is actually expected behavior which previously was not working as expected. When a custom info.plist is included at the root of the project in Studio, those values will be used. In this case, the app ID and version information will come from the custom info.plist.
   
   Satyam, please examine the KS info.plist and verify that the "Different instance" of KS matches these values. Marking invalid for now. Please close if you agree.</li>

   The presence of custom info.plist in KS project was creating two instance of the application. The fix for the ticket TIMOB-12069 has fixed the issue. </li>
