<h3>Description</h3>

Not a regression.

Description:
1.Take note of the version no on tiapp.xml(2.1.4GA).
Note:You can also use a four segment such as 1.2.3.4 
2.Build kitchensink for iOS.
3.Open the info.plist file for kitchensink.
4.Notice the CFBundle version key in info.plist

Note:
CFBundleVersion (String - iOS, OS X) specifies the build version number of the bundle, which identifies an iteration (released or unreleased) of the bundle. The build version number should be a string comprised of three non-negative, period-separated integers with the first integer being greater than zero. The string should only contain numeric (0-9) and period (.) characters. Leading zeros are truncated from each integer and will be ignored (that is, 1.02.3 is equavalent to 1.2.3). This key is not localizable.

Actual Result:
1.You will see alpha characters next to the version number or four integers.

Expected Results:
1.You should just see max of 3 integers separated with periods.

   just happend to us as well, on SDK 3.1.3.GA, we tried to get version 1.0.4.1 to build. we saw the .plist file in the resources folder which was fine, but the .plist filed copied by Titanium build process to the build folder was truncated</li>
