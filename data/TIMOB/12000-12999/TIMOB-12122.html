<h3>Description</h3>

We need the ability to prioritize events in the event queue.  I've ran in to numerous occasions where the event queue would block critical user actions because of other events running that were less important.  For instance, I'd like to always make sure the orientation event is priority over any other event in the queue.

   "We then added the AnimationQueue, a new class that's responsible for all animations and events, as well as scheduling heavy tasks for later execution during the CPU's idle time. It acts as the framework's traffic cop, prioritizing different operations and helps ensure the application stays responsive. When an app is animating, it suspends lower priority functions. When the app is idle, the AnimationQueue executes the suspended tasks."</li>
