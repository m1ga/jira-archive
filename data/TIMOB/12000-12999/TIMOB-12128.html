<h3>Description</h3>

In order to measure the performance of Mobile Web, we need a benchmark that measures various aspects such as creating TableViews with a 10,000 rows and so on. The benchmark needs to output some sort of measurement data that we can compare between builds. I'm not sure if the benchmark should be a score or a time or what.

   I think the benchmark suite should output execution time with an indicator if it falls within an acceptable range and then also a score based on its execution time compared to previous builds.</li>

   I'm not sure if it's possible, but if there is any way of capturing FPS for, say, animations, that could be really useful as well</li>

   I'd like to broaden the scope of this project and just create a "Titanium" benchmark. We'll just test for platform specific metrics.</li>

   Marking ticket as "Won't Fix" as MobileWeb has been deprecated.</li>
