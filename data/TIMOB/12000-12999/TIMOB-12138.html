<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Issue</h4>

As of now, the alert dialog in Android gets dismissed even when we click outside its bounds. 

It has been requested to add a new feature that would allow to disable this.

<h4>Reference</h4>

I believe there is a native method called *setCancelledOnTouchOutside* that is is not exposed yet in the Titanium API.
