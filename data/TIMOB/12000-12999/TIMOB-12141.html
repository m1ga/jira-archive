<h3>Description</h3>

In the case of animations which change size or coordinates, this is basically a duplicate of TIMOB-1101.  But others like color or opacity animations are special.  If you run an animation on a view (such as an opacity animation) and then later run another one, you of course want the newer animation to start from what is the current visible state of the view on screen.  For example, if you animated to 50% animation and want to now animate to 100% opacity, you want this second animation to obviously start at 50% and move to 100%.  With old Android animation, the actual properties of the view do not change after the animation is complete.  And there are no properties available to tell you what the view currently looks like (post-first-animation).  So in the example, at the time I want to make the second animation (to 100%) there is no property I can check that will tell me that it's currently at 50% opacity, and for the second animation I must tell it the "starting" opacity.  So Ti Android has ugly code in there to set variables to "remember" the last-animated-to-opacity (and color, etc.) It's ugly.

   Verified fixed on:
   Mac OSX 10.9 Mavericks
   Titanium Studio, build: 3.2.0.201311160316
   Titanium SDK, build: 3.2.0.v20131118142443
   CLI: 3.2.0-alpha
   Alloy: 1.3.0
   
   Tested using test cases from TIMOB-11993 and TIMOB-6852 and both do as expected.
