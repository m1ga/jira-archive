<h3>Description</h3>

In 3.0.0 we deprecated Rhino as a supported runtime. We now need to remove it from the core to allow us to clean up the related code.

   Testing instructions:
   
   After rhino has been removed, we need to verify that the sdk builds, and also test to make sure it doesn't break modules.  To verify that the sdk works, do the following:
   1. Build the sdk with scons (It should be faster than before since it doesn't have to compile rhino related code)
   2. Run KS with the runtime set to rhino (it should just launch with v8 instead)
   3. Verify in logcat that you get something like
   <code><pre>
   I/TiApplication( 2339): (main) [87,504] Titanium Javascript runtime: v8
   </pre></code>
   4. Run KS with the runtime set to v8 make sure it runs as well.
   
   For testing with a module, you need to verify that older modules still build, and also that we are able to create new modules.
   
   Testing with an older module:
   1. Create a module with an older sdk
   2. In the build properties file, modify the sdk to point to the new one
   3. Type in 'ant' to build the module.
   4. Install the module into studio and run with the app.js inside the example directory of the module.
   
   The app should run with a red square if you use the example code.
   
   Testing with a new module.
   1. Create a new module with a command like: titanium.py create --platform=android --type=module --name=moduleTest --id=com.moduleTest --android=~/Android/android-sdk-mac_x86/
   2. Build the module with ant
   3. Install the module into studio and run with the app.js inside the example directory of the module.
   
   The app should run with a red square if you use the example code.

   Rhino support is removed.  Added <property name="ti.android.runtime">rhino</property> in tiapp.xml to set the rhino runtime then executed the app.
   Runtime detected as 'v8' in logs in monitor.
   
   Verified on:
   SDK version:  3.1.0.v20130320190115 
   CLI version : 3.0.24
   OS : MAC OSX 10.7.5
   XCode : 4.5.1
