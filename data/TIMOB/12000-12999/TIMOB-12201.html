<h3>Description</h3>

The customer is listening to the swipe event on certain divs, but on Android the scrollableView is navigation to the next or previous view instead of firing the event in the webView. On Android, e.PreventDefault(ontouchmove) does not disable the swipe on the scrollableView. In the attached project I've included the Zepto.js
<h4>Steps to reproduce</h4>
1. Create an alloy project in the studio.
2. Replace its app folder with the attached app folder
2. Open the application, when try to swipe the upperleft image it'll swipe the scrollableView.
The screencast link is here showing how it works fine on iPad <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKqzmnNXts8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKqzmnNXts8</a>

   [~shossain], is there any update on the a test case?
   
   e.PreventDefault() is not a Titanium API, so I'm not sure why that is listed in the ticket.  After looking through it a little, I suspect that this issue arises because in Android, we don't support the 'willHandleTouches' property on a webview (<a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#</a>!/api/Titanium.UI.WebView-property-willHandleTouches) I tried removing the property in iOS and I get similar behavior as I do in Android (you can scroll the scrollable view when swiping the webview).
   
   If we could have a reproducible without alloy, that would be great.  It would also be helpful if we had a testcase that did not rely on third party libraries.</li>

   Resolving as needs more info for now.  Please reopen when there is an updated test case.</li>
