<h3>Description</h3>

Node.js script will handle complex logic required for sdk build (ex. template parsing, remote file fetching, test scripts)

   Do we really want to introduce a dependency on make? Can't we just build a node.js build system that mimics make?</li>
<li>Christian Sullivan 2013-01-05

   The node.js scripts can still be directly called the make file just serves as a proxy layer. This is common for most npm packages.
   It also will keep the build scripts cleaner leaving simple tasks and the execution of multiple tasks in one call to the makefile.
   This can also be accomplished via the package.json file and npm if everyone thinks that would be a better solution. I personally just like make because the api is less likely to change then npm. </li>
