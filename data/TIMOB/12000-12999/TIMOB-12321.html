<h3>Description</h3>

A key issue with the code processor is getting it to process all of the code. When a node is not processed, it could be for a variety of reasons. Sometimes it's because the code is actually never executed, and we don't want to analyze it, but sometimes it's because of a limitation in the code processor (or just analyzing offline in general). Knowing which is which is difficult and, in some cases, impossible. Ultimately we want to try and make the code processor as accurate as possible, but adding an option to automatically analyze all un-analyzed code could be useful, despite the possibility for false positives.

   Note: Code annotations may be necessary to getting this to work reliably, but until we do some tests I'm not sure.</li>
