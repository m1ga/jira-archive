   We should look into why Studio is throwing an error and if this limitation can be removed.
   I am not sure we need to block the release for this bug, but would be nice to have it in.</li>
<li>Russell McMahon 2013-05-23

   The fix has been merged into master but not back ported to 3.1.1 yet
   </li>
<li>Josh Roesslein 2013-05-23

   Still seeing the issue while testing a back port for 3_1_X.
   Will also test master branch once the recent CI build finishes.</li>

<li>Josh Roesslein 2013-05-24

   Talking with Pedro there is still an issue with app names having multiple spaces.
   We will address this in the back port pull request which is open and submit
   a new pull request for master to fix it.</li>
<li>Josh Roesslein 2013-05-24

   Confirmed multiple spaces in the app name results in a failed build. See log.txt attached to this ticket.</li>
<li>Josh Roesslein 2013-05-24

   Also some "other" characters like / cause the build to fail. We don't seem to sanitize the name before using it in paths.</li>
<li>Josh Roesslein 2013-05-24

   Pedro will be looking into this as he has some ideas.</li>
<li>Russell McMahon 2013-05-25

   tested multiple spaces and using . (dot) and - (dash) seems those characters work in them</li>
<li>Lokesh Choudhary 2013-05-31

    Verified the fix & we can create an app with space in it.
    Thus closing.
