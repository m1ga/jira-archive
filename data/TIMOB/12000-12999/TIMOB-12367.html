<h3>Description</h3>

While creating additional test cases for the CLI, it became evident that users that either delete the currently active SDK or in some cases have never selected one will encounter strange issues that are not evident how to fix. 

The workaround is to use ti sdk select to choose an active build

Steps to reproduce:
1) Use ti sdk to list your sdks
2) Delete the active sdk from your system using the finder (using ti sdk uninstall will set another sdk as active)
3) perform a ti build -h

Result:
[ERROR] "build" is an unrecognized command.

   To test:
   
   1. Rename the "mobilesdk" folder to "mobilesdk2" where your Titanium SDKs are installed
   2. Run "ti sdk" to verify there are no SDKs installed
   3. Run "ti" and notice there are no SDK level commands (build, clean, create, project)
   4. Run "ti build" and instead of showing an unknown command, it will say you need to install a Titanium SDK
   
   To restore your system, rename your "mobilesdk2" folder back to "mobilesdk".</li>

   Verified fixed on:
   Mac OSX 10.9 Mavericks
   Titanium Studio, build: 3.2.0.201311160316
   Titanium SDK, build: 3.2.0.v20131117001643
   CLI: 3.2.0-alpha
   Alloy: 1.3.0
   
   CLI provides message telling user to install a Titanium SDK, rather than just displaying an error message about unknown commands.
   Closing.</li>
