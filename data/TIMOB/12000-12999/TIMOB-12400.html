<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>problem</h4>

Running a basic Titanium app, without a full rebuild, on iOS is about twice as fast with the old CLI as it is with the new CLI. On my machine, old CLI builds would take about 3-8 seconds. The new CLI builds take about 10-15 seconds. Obviously these times will vary based on your machine's capabilities.

This only appears to affect iOS builds as I believe Android builds are still deferring to the old python system.

<h4>reproduce</h4>

Execute steps 2-5 for both TiSDKs 3.0.0.GA and 2.1.4.GA. 

<h4>Create a new Titanium project (default 2-tabbed is fine)</h4>
<h4>build it once for iphone simulator</h4>
<h4>Make a small code change and build it again</h4>
<h4>Repeat step 3 a couple times to get an average of times</h4>

The average of the 2.1.4.GA times should be significantly lower than those of the 3.0.0.GA SDK. Be sure these are not full rebuilds when getting an average.

   You'll be happy to know, you're not crazy.
   
   First time compile:
   <code><pre>
   2.1.4.GA python 14.13 seconds
   3.1.0 python    13.79 seconds
   3.1.0 node.js   11.9 seconds
   </pre></code>
   
   Subsequent compile times:
   <code><pre>
   2.1.4.GA python 3.19 seconds
   3.1.0 python    3.21 seconds
   3.1.0 node.js   7.4 seconds
   </pre></code>
   
   Something is definitely wrong.</li>

   Oh I'm crazy, but it's good to know this isn't one of the symptoms. Let me know if there's anything I can do to help test any timing on any future changes to address this.</li>

   To test:
   
   1) create a project
   2) build the project for ios simulator: titanium build -p ios
   3) build it again... should take a second or so</li>
