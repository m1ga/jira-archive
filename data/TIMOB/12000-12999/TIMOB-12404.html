   Run from command line as per the BB github instructions if you see output in terminal window then the bug is in Titanium Studio.</li>

   @Russ : tried out the command line optioned mentioned in the github instructions & found the following observations:
          1.On both simulator & device we are getting logs but they are kinda intermediate.Its like they are buffered.
            Use the code below in your app.js to test:
            <code><pre>
   var win = Ti.UI.createWindow();
   win.add(Ti.UI.createLabel({text: 'Hello, BlackBerry!'}));
   var button = Titanium.UI.createButton({
      title: 'Hello',
      top: 60,
      width: 200,
      height: 100
   });
   button.addEventListener('click',function(e)
   {
      Titanium.API.info("You clicked the button");
   });
   win.add(button);
   win.open();
   </pre></code>
   Clicking on 'Hello'button once does not show us any logs but clicking on it twice (clicking one after the other) gives us one log,similarly clicking it twice gives us two logs.Its somehow does not work when clicked normally once like any other user will do.</li>

   This will likely involve working with Studio on integrating support. They way require some CLI support.</li>

   Verified the fix & we can see the info logs in console.
   Thus closing.
   
   Ti Studio:3.1.0.201304031528
   Ti SDK : 3.1.0.201304031528

   Was this actually fixed in Studio? If not this should have been converted to a TISTUD bug not closed.</li>
<li>Russell McMahon 2013-04-05

   This was fixed. Unfortunately we will need to retest using the new CLI.</li>
<li>Lokesh Choudhary 2013-04-05

   I am not aware if we had any studio issue for this but I closed as I could see the logs on studio console.</li>
<li>Josh Roesslein 2013-04-05

   Okay thanks for confirming it as fixed.</li>
