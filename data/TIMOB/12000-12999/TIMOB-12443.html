<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Issue</h4>
While using the trackball within a tableview each row is selected although the focusable property is (default and explicitly) set to false.

<h4>Expected Result</h4>
Navigating with the trackball may scroll a tableview but does not select its rows.

<h4>Actual Result</h4>
Rows are selected (green background in my case, like you've tapped them) while using trackball

<h4>Repro sequence</h4>
<code><pre>
var win = Ti.UI.createWindow({
    width:Ti.UI.FILL,
    height:Ti.UI.FILL
});

var rows = [];
for ( var i = 0; i &lt; 50; i++) {
    rows.push({title: 'Row ' + i, focusable: false});
}
var tableView = Ti.UI.createTableView({
    width : Ti.UI.FILL,
    height : Ti.UI.FILL,
    data: rows; //maybe i used [rows] in my test case, please try both if one of this might be wrong, cause i'm writing it out of my mind.
});
win.add(tableView);
win.open();
</pre></code>

   it seems to apply to all elements. also buttons are focused although they are declared with focusable false!</li>

   I'm not sure to follow you. The *focusable* property, i.e. <a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#</a>!/api/Titanium.UI.View-property-focusable is meant to make a View focusable or not while navigating with the trackball.
   
   In Android all the clickable UI items are expected to get focus and be clicked with trackball/dpad mode. That expected Android behavior it will try to focus the first UI item.
   
   You can also try to set it to be fully transparent but it could get cosmetic side effects.
   
   I'll leave this open for a while in case of any clarifications.</li>

   [~egomez] Sorry but maybe i didn't understand what *focusable* correctly. But if you try the example above there is no difference between foucsable: true and focusable: false. So what should be different? </li>

   Make sure that all user interface elements that can accept input (touches or typing) can be reached with a directional controller, such as a trackball, D-pad (physical or virtual) or navigation gestures.
   
   Moved to main project to dig into it. Labels and format updated.</li>
