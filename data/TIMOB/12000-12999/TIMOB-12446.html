<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Problem Description</h4>

When distributing to app store (google play), compilation fails with several false syntax errors.

the project runs without errors on normal emulator/install to device runs

Attached: The console output from the build, and the file 'm.js' that triggers the errors

Here is some sample errors:

<code><pre>
Error:
[ERROR] /home/esm/Documents/Dropbox/Titanium Studio Workspace/BuddyShop/build/android/bin/assets/Resources/m/m.js:161: ERROR - Parse error. missing name after . operator
	M.long = function(flt) {
</pre></code>

It's a straight forward function declaration that looks like this:

<code><pre>
	M.long = function(flt) {
		return M.screen.getLong(flt)
	}
</pre></code>

There are other types. All of them are marked as syntax errors, none of them really are

This prevents me from publishing, and that's very serious - so I marked this ticket 'critical'

   It might be worth noting that 'long' and 'short' are reserved words - these are the two first errors.
   
   But there should not be such a huge difference between valid code during development and valid code for packaging.</li>

   This ticket is very old, doesn't include a reproducible test case, and most likely isn't an issue with Titanium. Resolving as invalid. Feel free to reopen if there's a real issue.</li>

   Closing ticket as invalid with reference to the previous comments.</li>
