   On BlackBerry keeping the screen on is a flag on the main window, not on each control.
   We may need a different API than what is implemented for Android. We may want to get input
   at the architectural meeting before settling on an API.</li>

   Pushing this up a few sprints until an API can be approved to support this feature.
   Using a "keepScreenOn" property on a View isn't trivial to implement on other platforms besides Android.
   
   Right now Android is the only one that supports this API.</li>

   Android only API and does not map well to other platforms.
   There is an open API issue to introduce a better API for keeping screen on.</li>

   Closing ticket as the issue will not fix.</li>
