<h3>Description</h3>

Update the "master" branch of titanium_mobile with features currently supported
in BlackBerry as of today plus include any other documentation developers will
need to know.

If there is any quirks developers need to know about, feel free to mention it, but
double check there's a bug ticket open to address it in the future with note to
update documentation to remove such a notice.

Note: There may be some changes in the Mac. fork we can re-use.

   Moving this as a GA requirement not for beta. The API is still in some flux and there are still several features required for QA that are remaining. </li>

   Closing ticket as fixed.</li>
