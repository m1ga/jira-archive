<h3>Description</h3>

While the phone is in landscape, changing tabs lead to change orientation into portrait mode first then back to landscape.
This is not regression since the issue occurs in 3.0.0 GA as well.

Steps to reproduce:

1. Launch kitchensink.
2. Change orientation of phone to landscape. 
3. Change tab.

Actual:
The screen moves to portrait mode then moves back to landscape mode.

Expected:
The screen should not move to portrait mode until the phone is not moved to that direction.
