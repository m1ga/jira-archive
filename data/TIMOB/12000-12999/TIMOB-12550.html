   Unable to reproduce with SDK 3.0.2.v20130129171611</li>
<li>Paras Mishra 2013-02-04

   I tested on OS : Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS
   SDK: 3.0.2.v20130201161712 , 3.0.2.v20130129171611
   
   Steps to reproduce:
   1. Go to the project directory in terminal.
   2. Run titanium build
   3. Enter android for target platform.
   
   Project doesn't build.

   Is this a regression? Can you step back to 3.0.23 and build? Has this system ever built? This doesn't work in Studio as well? Can you launch an AVD independently of Studio or the CLI? Are the android SDK and NDK set up as environment variables?</li>

   Can't reproduce. No log output. Resolving.</li>
