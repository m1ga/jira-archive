<h3>Description</h3>

Remote audio controls ( when screen is locked or app goes to background ) work as expected with createSound object but not with createAudioPlayer API ( audio player object ). I have discussed this with iOS team and confirmed that its not been implemented in AudioPlayer.
The implementation can be found here. <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/86" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/86</a>

   +1 this is pretty much an essential feature for any app that wants to be successful and have background audio.  And the code is already basically written.</li>
