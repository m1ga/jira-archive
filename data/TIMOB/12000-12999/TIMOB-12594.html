<h3>Description</h3>

Right now, getting the changelog for one of our node.js projects (cli, alloy, code processor, etc) is difficult because you have to first download that version of the project. If we put the changelog in the package.json file, this can be fetched via 'npm info <project>' without downloading the entire project.

This should probably be put in a "changelog" field and, for readabilities sake, should probably go at the end.

The format will be Markdown

   Appears there is a Java library we can use to read markdown: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/markdownj/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://code.google.com/p/markdownj/</a></li>

   Subtasks: node-appc, titanium, code processor, alloy, create script to automate (hook into npm?), approval sub-task</li>

   We still don't have this in place, so we're missing release notes for all of these packages.
   
   Ingo came up with the following alternate suggestion: if we tag each of these releases in github, we can pull the CHANGELOG.md directly from github using the tag, like this:
   
   <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/blob/3_1_0_GA/README.md" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/blob/3_1_0_GA/README.md</a>
   
   Any objections? We should really get this fixed, and this would at least get proper release notes showing up in Studio. Plus, we should probably be tagging releases anyway.

   We have implemented another solution wherein we tag each release in Git, allowing studio to query that tag and getting the changelog at that version.</li>
