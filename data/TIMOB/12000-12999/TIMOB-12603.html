<h3>Description</h3>

Picker is unable to focus on disabled option and keeps on flickering.

This is not regression since the issue occurs in 3.0.0 GA as well.
This behaviour is observed in iPhone5 only and not in iPhone3GS.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Launch Kitchensink app.
2. Go to Controls > picker > Countdown picker.
3. In the picker, select 0hours 1 min.
4. press start. 
5. Observe the picker.

Actual:
The picker constantly changes its value from 0 to 1 even if it's there only.

Expected:
No need to show this behavior.
