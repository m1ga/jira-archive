<h3>Description</h3>

I think it might not relate to our sdk but want to keep this in database for future reference.

The simulators for Blackberry have no provision to change orientation to landscape or portrait & vice versa.
So,as of now we can't test orientation change issues on simulators.

   There is an application to control the simulator (ex: change orientation).

   Would this satisfy the needs for this ticket? If so please resolve, otherwise specify what is needed exactly.</li>

   Thanks for pointing out the controller,this is not user friendly as compared to our other platforms.Our customers or people normally won't go & fetch the controller or even if they knew it,its too cumbersome to keep cluster of things to running around just to change the orientation.
   
   Also, for some of our tests in KS which tests orientation by changing itself (not manually through controller) how would that happen? 
   If controller is the only way then we won't be able to test those orientation test cases in simulators ever.
   
   There is nothing I can say 'I want', but I logged it so as in future ref or might be documentation thing.That's for to decide later.</li>

   Closing issue as we no longer offer support for BlackBerry.</li>
