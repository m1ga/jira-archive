<h3>Description</h3>

*Problem description*
Currently whenever I want to package up an enterprise or app store version of an ipa, I have to open the xcodeproj file in build/iphone in Xcode and edit certain values: release build, target universal device, armv7, provisioning profile, etc... This is reasonable because everyone will have different preferences for these values.

However, the most annoying thing is that I have to drag & drop all of the iTunes images from Resources/iphone into xCode to set the app icons and splash screens. These images have standardized names (see attached screenshot) so Titanium should be smart enough to auto-embed them into the project so that we don't have to drag & drop them in every single time.

A rebuttal may be that you only need to set them once and then never delete the xcodeproj file, however doing a clean project or touching tiapp.xml erases the changes and regenerates the xcodeproj file so this is not practical, especially since cleaning project is a must in many situations such as updating the Ti SDK version or updating a jss file.

   I've built a few apps for the iTunes App Store and never needed to open the Xcode project to embed images as you describe. As long as you follow the naming and location guidelines described in the [Icons and Splash Screens guide](<a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#</a>!/guide/Icons_and_Splash_Screens), the tooling should copy the graphics to your app bundle. At least, it always has for me.
   
   The tooling should prompt you for provisioning profiles, and you can set most plist values via the tiapp.xml. To target a Universal build, you simply select both iPhone and iPad as targets in the tiapp.xml. I have not attempted to change build architectures (your reference to arm7) so perhaps that would require modifying the Xcode project.
   
   Can you explain the steps you're taking in more detail so I can ascertain the underlying cause of the issues you're seeing?</li>

   I created this ticket 2 years ago, so if you're seeing it work correctly then it most likely has been fixed and this can be resolved.</li>
<li>Tim Poulsen 2015-02-05

   Great. I was hoping it was that simple!</li>
<li>Tim Poulsen 2015-02-05

   There isn't a "fixed in the interim by other changes" resolution reason, so I'll resolve as Cannot Reproduce.</li>

   Closing ticket as the issue cannot be reproduced and due to the above comments.</li>
