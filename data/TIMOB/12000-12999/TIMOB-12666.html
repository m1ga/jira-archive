<h3>Description</h3>

When the code processor is run against iphone, then the analysis coverage plugin details that it visited nodes for resources defined under other platform folders as well (for ex: MasterDetail/Resources/ui/handheld/android/ or mobileweb). 

Since those resources are specific to other platforms, I guess they should not be visited as part of code analysis. For example, the output of analysis-coverage plugin shows the visited nodes of android even when the code processor is run against iphone platform -
"/Users/pinnamuri/Documents/Titanium_Studio_Workspace_New/MasterDetail/Resources/ui/handheld/android/ApplicationWindow.js":{"numNodesVisited":86,"numNodesSkipped":0,"numTotalNodes":89},

   When running the code processor, are you setting processUnvisitedCode to true? If so, then this is the expected behavior, but otherwise it _may_ be a bug.</li>

   The only code that is known to be platform specific is code that lives under Resources/[iphone, ipad, android, mobileweb]. Anything else is not technically platform specific, except by the coders own coding conventions which the code processor can't know</li>
