   Isn't that replaced with "applyProperties"?</li>
<li>Josh Roesslein 2013-02-12

   applyProperties is a more general way to change properties of a proxy in bulk.
   
   The layout start/finish methods probably won't really be needed on BlackBerry due
   to how we run on a single thread. We can automatically batch layout updates at the next
   "tick" of the event loop when JS code makes updates. The other native platform cannot
   do the same due to how method/property updates act "async" because having to dispatch between
   the JS thread and main thread (sending non-blocking messages).</li>
<li>Blain Hamon 2013-03-11

   Correct. ApplyProperties is a more general version in that all proxies, not just view proxies, have it. The layout start/finish were never implemented on any platform, and have since been deprecated and removed.</li>

   Placing these items on hold for the moment based on community interest.</li>

   Closing ticket as BlackBerry is no longer supported by us.</li>
