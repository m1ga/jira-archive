<h3>Description</h3>

In Studio we would like to invoke code processor at project build time, e.g. when saving a file, but it requires code processor to support passing in multiple platforms and return the combined result since we are not running against a particular platform at that point.

   The fundamental architecture of the code processor makes this impossible</li>
<li>Bryan Hughes 2013-03-29

   This will be performed by running multiple times against each platform</li>
<li>Ingo Muschenetz 2013-03-29

   Moved to an issue so it will show up in the planning board. Linked it directly and also added it under the epic.</li>
<li>Chris Barber 2016-08-24

   Code processor is dead.</li>
<li>Lee Morris 2017-03-20

   Closing ticket as Code processor is no longer supported.</li>
