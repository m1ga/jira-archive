   Hello Stanislav,
   
   Why wouldn't you set the desired size of the switch before hand? Leaving the width property blank leaves it to be resized every time the button is switched. It is generally good practice to set the desired width of the switch because then the resizing will not happen. Have you tried this?

   Hi, Carter.
   Thanks for fast answer.
   
   It's ok that Switch resizes on some event(like click). That not a problem.
   But it's not ok when you don't touch it - switch still resizes! 
   In a sample (and video) i have provided 2 switches. When i click on first one - second changes! It's very weird.
   
   Switch should set right (new) size on it's own events - not on some event from any another switch. And it's not ok "pixel by pixel adjusting" (you can see it on video). Right size should be set once for each text (one size for "on text" another for "off text").
    
   Regards,
   Stanislav</li>
