<h3>Description</h3>

The common-globals plugin is rather hacky and doesn't track well with the Titanium API (which defines the common globals). We should merge it in and use the new value override mechanism for implementing support for the contents of common globals

   After doing some investigation, I don't think I can remove it just yet as much as I would like to. There are some unique difficulties in the "global" section of the Ti docs that require too much custom logic to graft onto the ti-api-processor plugin. Maybe some day.</li>
