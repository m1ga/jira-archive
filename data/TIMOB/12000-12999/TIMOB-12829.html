<h3>Description</h3>

   [Screenshot|^2013-02-22_14-37-29.png] of the test app I wrote for iOS is crashing on Android. This is a good, simple app to measure representative bridge traffic, so I need to fix this to continue.</li>

   Hi Matt--where are we with this app? Should I get an Android team member to look at it?</li>

   I was able to work around this specific problem. However, I'm currently blocked by a Soasta installation problem with Android emulator. I do have Soasta installed and working for iPhone simulator. I've been working with Thomas and team to come up to speed on Soasta, but no one has encountered my problem, so I have reached out directly to Soasta.
   
   FYI, here is some Soasta feedback: Soasta has been very useful for my performance and profiling work since I can replay app usage repeatedly to gather statistics. However, since it is cloud based I am dependent on our internal network which has been problematic the past few days. It would be nice if there was a standalone way to run Soasta like e.g. Instruments.</li>

   Need to either fix this issue or find a workaround.</li>
