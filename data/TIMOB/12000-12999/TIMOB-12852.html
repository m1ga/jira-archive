<h3>Description</h3>

There are 15 JNI methods in the Kroll layer of our Android code base that I have instrumented to collect profile data:

V8Function.java (2 JNI calls)
V8Object.java (6 JNI calls)
V8Runtime.java (7 JNI calls)

I will funnel this data through Max's profiler API (TIMOB-12850).

My modifications to V8Function.cpp, V8Object.cpp and V8Runtime.cpp should be in a separate shared library (e.g. libkroll-v8p.so where the "p" is for profile) that is only packaged in the .apk when the user wants to profile their app. I don't know the scope of this work since I don't know if we currently have the infrastructure with studio to support this.
