<h3>Description</h3>

We have reports of users encountering sync failures that seem iTunes-related. In these cases, a simple disconnect-reconnect resolves the inability to sync. The issue is that in these cases, the error presented to the user does not indicate the cause of the failure, and has proven frustrating for those that encounter it.

Please see the related ticket for more information.

Steps to reproduce:
1) Get iTunes into a bad state where it is unable to sync. (This is the tricky part. We have yet to determine reproducible steps for this)
2) Attempt to build for iOS device from Studio

Result: 
Failure, but with little to indicate how to resolve

Expected:
More detailed information on the cause of the failure. Possibly troubleshooting steps to follow.

   iTunes sync is on the brink of deprecation. It's successor, node-ios-device, has been in production for almost 4 years and superior in all ways.</li>

   Closing ticket as the issue will not fix.</li>
