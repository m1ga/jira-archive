<h3>Description</h3>

*Problem*
When a toolbar has buttons in it separated by a flexible/fixed space, the buttons have very large hitboxes well outside of actual button itself

*Steps to Reproduce*
1. Open Kitchen Sink
2. Navigate to Controls > Toolbar > (Click middle of the two buttons in the bottom bar)
3. Controls > System Buttons > Button Group 2 > (Click between trash and reply in the bottom bar)

Notice in comparison to: Controls > System Buttons > Button Group 5
The bottom bar between the info buttons work as expected.
The add button in the topbar and back button also work as expected.

This bug causes end users some bad ui problems, as clicking anywhere in the toolbar, even when not on a button, will trigger some action in the app.

   Tommy, do you have any particular test cases in which you are experiencing this behavior or is it only in the kitchen sink?</li>

   We have a custom top toolbar for our app. It has a back button and two buttons on the right with a flexible space in the middle. It uses the "items" property.
   
   When the user clicks the middle of the toolbar, for whatever reason, it will trigger the back button or one of the buttons on the right hand side.
   
   If we pull the code out into a simple test case, it is just the same as the kitchen sink example.</li>

   Confirmed behavior on Ti SDK 3.0.3.v20130219140159, iOS (6.0) Simulator.</li>

   Resolving ticket as Invalid as there is now a new version of Kitchen Sink available. </li>
