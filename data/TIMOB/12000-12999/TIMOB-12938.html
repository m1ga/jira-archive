<h3>Description</h3>

*Problem*
The file path format for annotation image is not consistent with the standard which should be: '/images/image.png'.
Rather in order to get the image the path currently needed to be provided is: 'images/image.png'

<code><pre>
MapModule.createAnnotation({
                latitude : 32.943868
                longitude : -96.836114,
                image : imagePath,
                title : 'My Home',
                subtitle : 'Nice place',
                leftButton : leftImage,             
            });
</pre></code>

the imagePath is not taken if it is under any folder, doesn't matter it is under folder "android" or not, ( I usually put android specific images under android,), but it works partially when I put the image directly under resource folder, so in a word,
'home.png' works
'/img/home.png' will not work,
if I don't have the leading slash in the path, having images under folder works, so the imagePath needs to be 'img/abc/home.png', then it can work. However, this is not consistent with current standard.

    I just found out if I don't have the leading slash in the path, having images under folder works,   so the imagePath needs to be 'img/abc/home.png',    then it can work.   However, this is not consistent with current standard.</li>

   removed "leftButton seems to be not supported any more, it is not even in API doc", only one issue per ticket please.</li>
