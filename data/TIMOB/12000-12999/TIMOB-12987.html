<h3>Description</h3>

During the triage of TIMOB-10526 these are the problems I discovered
1. releaseViews is overridden for TIMOB-7808 to get in parity with iOS which I think is a possible memory leak. Also the behavior in TIMOB-7808 is only on Android and iOS and not on MW. So a case can be made that we do not need parity.

2. This ticket also introduced release() which overrides the method in KrollProxy and does not call the parent method which does something completely different. 

3. Webviews are tied to the activity lifecycle which is fine if the window is heavyweight but not if the window is lightweight (Look at the code in onDestroy)
