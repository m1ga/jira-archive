<h3>Description</h3>

There is a lot of desire for the code processor to provide runtime estimates. It's not possible to accurately determine time, because that would involve me solving the Halting Problem and winning the Nobel Prize in Mathematics. That said, there *may* be a rough correlation between project size and runtime. We can do a statistical analysis on a bunch of customer apps to see if the number of AST nodes in a project vs runtime of said project to see if there is a strong enough correlation between size and runtime to give a rough estimate.
