<h3>Description</h3>

Zipcar is asking for support for Swipe Views/Scrollable Tabs in the Action Bar.

They hope that it will be a native control and not need to be managed in javascript. I am not so sure that this control is not managed in Android so we should look into this.

Here are the details:

Android Action Bar has support for Scrollable Tab View Control:

Which can be used in conjunction with Swipe Views:

<a href="http://developer.android.com/design/patterns/swipe-views.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://developer.android.com/design/patterns/swipe-views.html</a>

The UI pattern is to swipe the view with your finger and the view tracks your finger (like the Ti ScrollableView) and the scrollable tabs track the scrolling view

A good example of this UI is the Android Market app (Apps section)

See attached screen shots.

   Bert discovered the following link:
   
   <a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#</a>!/guide/Android_Action_Bar-section-36735509_AndroidActionBar-ActionBarTabs
   
   From the above link:
   
   "Drawer-style navigation is not supported. Only tabs are supported at this time. Depending on screen space and the number of tabs, Android may display the tabs as standard tabs, scrolling tabs, or a drop-down list."
   
   I did send this info to Zipcar so I believe that we already support this.
   
   If this is the case, then this issue can be closed.</li>

   I retract my comment. We would need to make sure that the UI is similar to the Android Market app. That is the native behavior Zipcar is looking for.
   
   Let's keep this open until we are sure our support for scrollable tabs matches the behavior Zipcar is looking for.</li>

   Is anyone looking at this? This is now a pretty common (and nice IMHO) UI pattern and I don't like telling customers it can't be done because the framework I selected doesn't support it.</li>
