<h3>Description</h3>

With the provided app.js clicking the openPhotoGallery button overlay doesn't work the first time consistently, but does on the second click. In a different set of circumstances, it works completely inconsistently and is sometimes impossible to open. I have yet to narrow down what is different in that completely inconsistent environment. 
\\
It appears to be related to having the button and the Ti.Media.openPhotoGallery within a camera overlay view as this is the only circumstance that seems to produce inconsistent results.

   For some reason the first time you tap openPhotoGallery, the error function in showCamera is called and this is shown:
   
   [INFO] Error showing camera
   [INFO] 1
   
   The second time you tap it, the gallery shows.
   
   Tested on 3.0.2 GA.</li>
