<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Steps to Reproduce</h4>
Install CVS in Studio
Create Alloy project.
Share the project in CVS
Make sure the Resources folder is added to .cvsignore
Build/Run the project.
Now the build procedure copys all folders in assets to Resources including the CVS folders.

<h4>Actual Result</h4>
The build procedure copys folders from App to Resources including the CVS folders.
Now Studio thinks these folders should be in cvs.

<h4>Expected Result</h4>
The build procedure should copy folders from App to Resources EXCLUDING the CVS folders.
So Studio do not think these folders should be in cvs.

   This might be a CLI issue, feel free to move if it is. I guess this is already implemented for SVN folders.</li>

   A similar problems seems to have been resolved for Subversion by fixes in either TIMOB or TISTUD, so I assume the same can be done for CVS. I don't have the source ticket, but here's the ticket I had in ALOY that originally mentioned the issue since resolved by Titanium: ALOY-448</li>

   Tested with Titanium SDK master (6.1.0) and cannot reproduce. The Titanium build system uses the global ignore dirs and ignore files regular expressions which are stored in the Titanium CLI config. This has been the case since June 2013: <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium/commit/505f801a01c714f7c8b0203c5f27df9102bb5215#diff-f7bf2b665273dfa66ffa4ad7c0a52bb9." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium/commit/505f801a01c714f7c8b0203c5f27df9102bb5215#diff-f7bf2b665273dfa66ffa4ad7c0a52bb9.</a></li>
