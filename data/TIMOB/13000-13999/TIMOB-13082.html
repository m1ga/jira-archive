<h3>Description</h3>

Currently the build id is in Resources/blackberry/Ti.Manifest for example buildID=15, every time a new package is created the build id must be incremented. This is done manually by incrementing the build id. A better solution would be to optionally pass the build id on the build command line when doing a "distribution" build if build id is passed in the the Ti.Manifest file can be updated during the build. Ti Studio currently puts up a file picker dialog when doing distribute to allow the user to choose the location and name of the signed published app. An addition would be to allow the user to enter the build id or auto increment the id for the user. 

This will require small changes to both the BB build scripts and Ti Studio.
