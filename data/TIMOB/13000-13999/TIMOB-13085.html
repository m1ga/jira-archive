   Long story short, winston sucks. I can't seem to fix this issue, plus logging to a file has some, shall we say, "quirks"
   
   Also worth noting, this only happens when runs are interrupted and the process hasn't been running long. It seems like it doesn't have a chance to flush to a file. I think it's safe to ignore this issue until we rip out winston from everything and replace it with something in node-appc (or a separate module entirely)</li>
