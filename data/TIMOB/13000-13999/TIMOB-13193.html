<h3>Description</h3>

Thanks to TIMOB-9317 we now are able to require submodules inside modules

Now it would nice to be able to use Ti.include with module compiled js files.

<h4>Test Steps</h4>

<h4>Module build</h4>
<h4>Create a new module project for Android/ios with the id com.foo.bar.</h4>
<h4>Download the attached assets.zip</h4>
<h4>Unzip assets.zip in the directory of the new module project</h4>
<h4>Run ant to build the module.</h4>

<h4>Project</h4>
<h4>Download the attached tic2043.zip and unzip it.</h4>
<h4>Import the resulting directory into TiStudio</h4>
<h4>Run project</h4>

<h4>Pass:</h4>
<h4>The test is simple, if you see "woo :)" in the console then it worked!</h4>

   This is a new feature request. Changing as such. Thanks for the suggestion, engineering will take a look at it.

   Sorry you are right, wasnt on purpose :s</li>

   Ok working with that i realised it was trickier than i though. In fact i cant rely on the context to guess where to get the file (assets or native module).
   It came to light while using the module. My native JS module has a method which will include a file. What you exepct is for the include to be looked for relatively from where the method was called and not relatively to the context.
   So what i ended up doing is simply to allow include to "look" for module in the same way require does.
   Ti.include('com.foo.bar/toto.js"); will look for toto.js in the module com.foo.bar (as it exists and is loaded).
   
   If you do 
   Ti.include('/toto.js");
   or 
   Ti.include('./toto.js");
   or
   Ti.include('toto.js");
   
   inside a module it will always look for the asset (like it was done before).
   
   I updated the test case to reflect all that
   
   I will post a pull request for that</li>

   Seems that now that it is a TIMOB ticket i cant modify it anymore :s
   So here is the expected pass
   [object ComFooBarModule] loaded
   [INFO] :   test1 from module com.foo.bar
   [INFO] :   test1 from app
   [INFO] :   module tested
   [INFO] :   test1 from app
   [INFO] :   test1 from module com.foo.bar
   
   Now for the assets, they need to be updated as the ones in the description are not good anymore :s
   you can get them there

   We have decided that we will be deprecating support to Ti.Include, so we don't want to extend support for this behavior.</li>
