<h3>Description</h3>

Using the default 2 tabbed app: <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile_blackberry/blob/master/test/apps/native/tibbtest/Resources/tabgroup_test.js" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile_blackberry/blob/master/test/apps/native/tibbtest/Resources/tabgroup_test.js</a>

The window with the white background in each tab should fill the entire tabgroup, as the initial layout state of Ti.UI.Window should be Ti.UI.FILL. Instead, it appears that the Window's size is only big enough for its content, similar to what you would expect to with Ti.UI.SIZE (see attached). Setting the height value of the Window manually has no effect using either Ti.UI.FILL or a static value like 300. Ti.UI.FILL should be the default behavior.

   This only seems to occur if the window has a title. Removing the title fixes the problem.
   Was able to reproduce this in a native Cascades application so this may be a BlackBerry bug.
   Trying to confirm now...</li>

   Is there a workaround then? How would one create a full-sized window or view in a tab then? I had no luck giving explicit valies for height.</li>
<li>Josh Roesslein 2013-04-16

   Don't use a title on a window. If you leave off the title on the window, it will fill the tab.</li>
<li>Tony Lukasavage 2013-04-16

   So the Windows don't have a title bar at all then when in tabs? Would it not make sense then to just ignore that property at the BB TiSDK level so the bug is never encountered?</li>

   No the windows do have a title bar when you set the "title" property.
   It seems to be triggering a bug in Cascades itself when you add a title bar
   to a "Page" when displaying it as a tab. This has been reported to BB and the workaround at the moment
   is not to specify a title on your window is displaying as a tab. This shouldn't affect regular windows with titles.</li>

   Closing ticket as this is not our bug.</li>
