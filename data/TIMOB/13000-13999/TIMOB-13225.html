<h3>Description</h3>

Alloy has the awesome device query system that requires the device to tell Alloy if it's a tablet or phone.

   I was thinking this would return phone or tablet to Alloy. I believe this is what the other platforms do. </li>

   I'd be happy if it did that. iOS I determine based on the osname of either iphone or ipad. Android reports the screen size in categories of small, medium, large, or xlarge. Any data from which I can draw a clear distinction between tablet and handheld works for me.</li>

   BlackBerry has publicly stated the there will be no port of BB 10 to the tablet so for now only phones are targeted. <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/06/28/blackberry-ceo-confirms-no-bb10-update-for-the-aging-playbook-tablet/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://techcrunch.com/2013/06/28/blackberry-ceo-confirms-no-bb10-update-for-the-aging-playbook-tablet/</a></li>

   Thanks [~rmcmahon]. To be clear, isTablet can essentially be hard-coded to "false" then?</li>
<li>Russell McMahon 2013-07-16

   Yes. I think that is the easiest thing to do for now. </li>

   Closing according to Russ's comment that BB is not gonna port BB10 apps on tablets.
