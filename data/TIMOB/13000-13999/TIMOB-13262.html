<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Description</h4>
I was unable to focus the textfields in the listView in one of the KitchenSnk tests. The test is located at: Base UI > Views > List View > Update Items.

<h4>Steps to reproduce:</h4>
1) Install the KS version from the repo on master branch
2) Navigate to Base UI > Views > List View > Update Items
3) Attempt to focus one of the two text fields in the top two rows

<h4>Result:</h4>
Text field does not focus, and Android back button UI flashes slightly.

46. Expected:
Text field focuses, allowing input

   Tested KS->ListView->Update Items on Galaxy Nexus (4.0.4) and everything works fine. Tested on HTC Sensation 4G (2.3.4) and the textfield does not work correctly. Steps to reproduce on HTC Sensation 4G:
   1.Click the test "Update Items" and the cursor shows in the first textfield. This is a correct behavior.
   2. Click the second textfield and the cursor does not show in the second textfield. Seems the first textfield always has the focus. This is not expected. Should be a bug in the listview.</li>

   Please also test <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/4090." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/4090.</a> To reproduce this fail case, simply type something in the first text field then click on the 2nd text field. 50% of the time you should see the value of the 2nd text field change to the value of the first. If it doesn't fail the first time, restart the app and start over.</li>

   how can this one be fixed?
   1 / i still have a focus problem on my Nexus 4 4.2.2.  As soon as i focus a textfield inside a listview, it gets unfocus (but the keyobard stays there).
   2 / it is never going to work correctly if you have multiple textfields. Why? because all the textfields from the same template share the same proxy thus the same value...</li>

   Can't edit my comment about the 1/, i fixed the "unfocus" problem. I still think the 2/ is a major problem (on its way to be fixed it seems)</li>
<li>Martin Guillon 2013-10-27

   Also i realised that it was SOFT_INPUT_ADJUST_RESIZE which broke everything. Because a layout is required the cells are redrawn thus the proxy is used to get the textfield values, but being shared the proxy has the wrong values â€¦
   I guess we cant use textfield in listviews without SOFT_INPUT_ADJUST_PAN
   
   Sorry</li>
