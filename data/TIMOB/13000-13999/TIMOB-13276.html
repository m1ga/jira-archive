   Okay, I'm confused. I was unable to recreate the issue (And I can't find a mention of java.js anywhere in the MASTER's HEAD of the repo.) Has this been fixed already?
   
   Furthermore, the linked packaging failure refers to being unable to find the NDK, which is used by V8's engine, not Rhino.
   
   Marking as cannot reproduce with the hopes of pow-wowing with Eric to figure out what's going on.</li>

   Cannot reproduce, might be environment setup?</li>

   Looked at it with Eric. Looks like this may be a Studio bug, as building via command line and building with old Studio has no issues.</li>

   Now the module gets created without any error.
   Environment used for verification -
   Titanium SDK: 3.1.0.v20130405170202
