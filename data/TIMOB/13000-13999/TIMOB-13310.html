<h3>Description</h3>

when using cli in dist-adhoc, it would be very nice to be able to build ipa in Debug/Developer Provisioning profile.
Why?
Because it allows to create nightly builds (only valid for 30 days i think with a developer provisioning profile).
I did that with normal ios app under jenkins. I could even put a download link on the build page.
Would be very nice to be able to do that with Titanium apps

   This can be done today by just doing a iOS Device build. The ipa file is sitting in the build/iphone/build/Debug-iphoneos/ directory.
   
   The only problem is if you do a device build, it will generate the ipa and initiate an iTunes sync. Due to a bug, the --build-only flag will unfortunately skip the ipa generation. That will be fixed with TIMOB-13663. So in the meantime, you'll have to deal with iTunes launching or copy the "iphone/cli/hooks/install.js" hook and modify it to build the ipa, but not initiate the iTunes sync. Otherwise wait until TIMOB-13663 is fixed and use a master build or wait until 3.2 ships. :)</li>

   Closing ticket as the issue will not fix and with reference to the above comments. </li>
