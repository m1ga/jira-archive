<h3>Description</h3>

When I used to use tiMake from matt apperson, when you went to deploy and there was multiple certs, it would provide a list of certs with a number next to each. You guys ask for the name, but I think the CLI has some confusion when you have 2 certs with the same name. 
Also, was never prompted to pick UUID of provisioning profiles.

   @Shak, the new prompt library I've already built has number next to the provisioning profiles as well as autocomplete. This functionality will be available in 3.2.0 for sure. This ticket will most likely be resolved as a dupe. It's worth pointing out that 3.0 and 3.1 will not use the new prompt library.</li>

   Works well with 
   ti build -p ios -T dist-adhoc</li>

   Closing ticket as fixed. After cli.prompt is set to true in ti config, then I was able to verify the CLI will prompt you for different iOS certs and provisioning profiles when you use the ti build command.
