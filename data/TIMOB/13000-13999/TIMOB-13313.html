<h3>Description</h3>

I tried using android-platform-11 Android JAR in module but it gives the following error message and does not run when try ant run or from eclipse.

Note: Build Path is configured properly.

   any news here?
   I just need a hotfix for the build.xml script. </li>

   Hi Mads/Ashish,
   
   Could you please provide a sample module and steps to reproduce this issue?
   
   I've tried creating a new module, and modifying the build.properties to API 11 and I don't run into this error.  This seems to be related to the android manifest generation, so I tried inserting a node into the timodule.xml file with no luck reproducing this.
   
   Thanks</li>

   Hi Allen,
   
   its this ticket: <a href="http://support.appcelerator.com/tickets/APP-737468/tickets" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://support.appcelerator.com/tickets/APP-737468/tickets</a> 
   
   and here is my module: <a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/2132088/NappMuPDF.zip" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://dl.dropbox.com/u/2132088/NappMuPDF.zip</a>

   [~viezel] I tried that module that it built fine for me. Do you have reproduction steps on when it 'fails' for you?  Was it during runtime or when you build the app or when you build the module?
   </li>
<li>Mads Moller 2013-04-10

   Hi Allen,
   
   It also builds fine, if I do "ant dist". But if I do "ant run" to get it to create an example project for the emulator. then the above console log happens. 
   It will complain that android-8 does not have the animator framework, and its properties. Which is correct.
   But my build.properties, I use android-11. 
   
   So somewhere in the build process in create the example app for the emulator / or device - its uses the android-8 rather than what I specify in the projects build.properties. 
   
   Are you following me? 
   
   Cheers, 
   Mads

   Hi Allen, 
   
   sorry for bugging you, but im going crazy with the workflow of copying the zip to a new project, clean the project, build to device. turnaround time is about 3-4 min. 
   
   Any quick fix solution for this? </li>
<li>Allen Yeung 2013-04-11

   This is a bug that we will properly fix in 3.2.0 during the rewrite of the android build command.
   
   For now you can work around this issue by doing the following:
   
   1. Go to the sdk directory that your module is using.  For me it was something like:
   /Library/Application Support/Titanium/mobilesdk/osx/3.2.0
   
   2. Open /Library/Application Support/Titanium/mobilesdk/osx/3.2.0/all/tiapp.xml (this is the template tiapp.xml that we use when a new project is generated)
   
   3. Change the android node to something like
   <code><pre>
   	<android xmlns:android="<a href="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android</a>">
   		<tool-api-level>11</tool-api-level>
   	</android>
   </pre></code>
   
   4. Then go back to your project and do 'ant run'
   
   The reason why this is happening is because the 'ant run' command actually creates a new project into a temp directory and then run that.  The api level is read from the tiapp.xml and not your build.properties.

   Hi Allen,
   
   Thanks for the quick fix. It works!
   But then a new issue arrises :) 
   using ant run or ant install will clear the libs folder. My module uses c libraries, which I place in the libs folder. 
   Where can I place them, so they are copied into the libs folder when compiled? 
   
   Cheers, Mads.  </li>
<li>Allen Yeung 2013-04-15

   'libs' is a folder where we place the generated libraries.  I would try placing it in 'lib' instead and see if that works for you.</li>
<li>Chris Barber 2016-08-29

    I have no idea exactly how to classify this. Allen states this was going to be fixed in the new Android build which shipped with Titanium SDK 3.2.0. On the other hand, the Ant build for Titanium modules was replaced in Titanium SDK 4.0.0.</li>
