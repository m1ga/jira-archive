<h3>Description</h3>

The internal [[Call]] method has been extended in a few places, but unfortunately there are two separate signatures with no way to distinguish between them. This is causing bugs with native methods and ambiguous contexts and potentially with eval contexts. They need to be refactored to call(thisVal, args, options).
