<h3>Description</h3>

in [HTTPClient](<a href="https://github.com/Akylas/titanium_mobile/blob/master/android/modules/network/src/java/ti/modules/titanium/network/TiHTTPClient.java#L354)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/Akylas/titanium_mobile/blob/master/android/modules/network/src/java/ti/modules/titanium/network/TiHTTPClient.java#L354)</a> we put the blob into a field called "blob".
I have no real problem with this, but in [TCPSocket](<a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/3.0/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/3.0/#</a>!/api/PumpCallbackArgs) (which actually uses Stream) the field is called "buffer".
They should coincide.
Actually this field in HTTPClient only exist on android,and is not documented.
But i use it in a pull request for a PersistentHTTPClient.

if it doesnt seem to big of a deal, i will create a simple pull request

   Hi Martin,
   
   If you could submit a pull request for this, that would be great, or if you could at least explain it along with some sample code, it's not too clear what you mean.
   
   Thanks!</li>

   Daniel: It simply a question of property name.
   "data" in TCPSocket represents the same thing as "blob" in HTTPClient
   
   As i said i can create a pull request but i want to make sure it would be accepted first as it requires property name change!</li>

   Hello Martin,
   the only way to know if it will be accepted is just simply send it. If it's rejected they will give you a reason. 
   
   Or drop by in the platform irc channel:
   
   Titanium developers regularly visit #titanium_app on irc.freenode.net.
   
   Best,

   Hi Martin,
   
   It seems the line number you linked to in the description is now out of sync, please update it to the correct line.
   
   Also link to the TCPSocket file and line number.
   
   I will then move it to TiMob.
   
   Thanks!</li>

   Daniel: I have updated the links but something really changed (i think since that bug ). I cant find "data" in TCPSocket anymore :s
   I see that it now uses a stream and su a buffer. So no really Blob anywhere.
   I wonder if it has changed or if i was just out of sleep :s
   
   If you find this request to be invalidated now, please close it.
   
   Thanks for your feedback</li>

   Martin,
   
   I've closed the issue as invalid, but also moved it to TiMob to leave it under the radar of engineering.
   
   Cheers.</li>
