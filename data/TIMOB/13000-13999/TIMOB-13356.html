<h3>Description</h3>

I was looking at creating a Service inheriting Service but without being android.app.Service. As a consequence of that i couldnt use TiBaseService and ServiceProxy as they just inherit android.app.Service.
So i had to copy everything.
Would be great if it was made an interface so that we could use subclasses of android.app.Service.

   This is also a requirement to be able to build android widgets.
   
   Is there any movement on this? 
   I'd be up for helping on this issue if we can get some attention on it.</li>
