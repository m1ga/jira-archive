Also, the full /bin/sh path appears to be explicit in the command - it was when I entered the commands in the two examples cases above in terminal.\r\nMy setup is relatively vanilla - the full path from terminal (echo $PATH) is:  \r\n/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/git/bin\r\n\r\n@Carter No it happened prior to upgrading to 3.0.2.  I tried deleting the workspace and creating a brand new one with a brand new default project, and it still happens.  I have done a little more investigation and it appears to be related to the volume.  If I create a workspace on a new volume I am able to create a new project (on the new volume) and compile it successfully.  No projects created on the problem volume appear to compile.  \r\n\r\nI haven't tried building for the device instead of the simulator yet, I'll reply with the results when I've had a chance to do so.\r\n\r\nOn the \"broken\" volume I've tried chmod 775 and xattr -d com.apple.quarantine for the entire volume with no change.\r\n\r\nI am reluctant to uninstall xcode, and as it builds in xcode if I load the project manually, and via terminal if I omit the -c, and via titanium if the project is on a different volume, I suspect the problem is elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThanks for all your suggestions.\r\n",

					"body": "ok I've done a lot more testing with this.  It appears to be triggered by copying a file in which has the quarantine attribute and then building the project.  After the build the entire volume is somehow marked and the build script fails for any project on the volume.\nI can't discern anything in particular about the volume where that attribute might be being applied (to the entire volume) but my OSX-FileSystem-Fu is still pretty novice.\nI'd say close this issue, as it can be avoided by being rigorous about not placing quarantine marked files in a project.  Though it's very annoying, and reverting to an old image of the volume is the only way I've discovered so far to fix the problem.\n",
