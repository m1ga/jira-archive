   The native UILabel on iOS doesn't allow HTML. I'm guessing the Android equivalent does...</li>
<li>Martin Guillon 2013-01-02

   yes you are right that s why i did it another way:
   <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/3647" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/3647</a>
   
   I am still heavily working on it, especially to fix/improve the ellipsize</li>
<li>Daniel Sefton 2013-01-02

   Nice. Thanks for all your direct contributions btw, it helps a lot.</li>
<li>Martin Guillon 2013-01-06

   I updated the pull request. It should fully functional with even more new features like "multiLineEllispize"
   
   Also the pull request now include the full android equivalent. Especially i fixed the ellipsize which wasnt working on multilines.
   I also added "multiLineEllispize"</li>
<li>Martin Guillon 2013-04-05

   Seeing there were absolutely no follow up on taht pull request i decided to close that pull request.
   I still have fully working on android/iphone. It's also performance optimised for tableview and listview (which the old one is not, like most widgets)
   
   If you still want this, please contact me</li>

   Sorry Martin, our team is short on time to look into large feature pull requests. We will get round to it eventually! :)</li>
<li>Martin Guillon 2013-04-05

   I do understand that!
   Then a solution would be to work closer together ;)
   
   Thanks for your quick feedback</li>

   I think this is a much needed feature. Can I please put in a request that the Ti team re-consider this one. Thanks</li>
<li>Mike Butler 2014-06-09

   This would help us out enormously - can you find the time to review the pull request?  I'm sure this would be a feature a lot of apps would use.  Please bump up the priority on this one!
   
   Thanks.</li>
<li>Martin Guillon 2014-06-09

    I would not count on that. That PR is really old and Appcelerator refused some of the modifications that comes with it... 
    If you need it i advise you to look at my fork 
    <a href="https://github.com/Akylas/titanium_mobile" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/Akylas/titanium_mobile</a></li>
<li>Mike Butler 2014-06-09

    Really I want to bump up the concept rather than the implementation.  I can't use the label.html that's there as it's not cross platform - and it's a feature that's crying out to be used...  So I'm hoping the Appcelerator guys will value it as well..</li>
<li>Pedro Enrique 2015-06-01

    Closing ticket. Use the <code>AttributedString</code> APIs
    <a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#</a>!/api/Titanium.UI.AttributedString</li>
<li>Neville Dastur 2015-06-02

    Again please re-consider. This is about convenience I agree, but I would have thought very useful. AttributedString is a PITA to use especially for simple label formats.
    In the meantime <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator-modules/ti.styledlabel" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator-modules/ti.styledlabel</a> does exist but I think can be a little heavyweight and not good in say listviews with hundreds of rows</li>
<li>Eric Merriman  2018-08-02

    Closing old "Won't fix" tickets. If you disagree, please reopen.</li>
<li>Marian Kucharcik 2019-12-31

    Hi guys,
    please reconsider implementation label.html property on iOS. Ti.StyledLabel is working, but as described above, it's heavyweight for use and this solution would be much more user friendly(parity with Android would be awesome).
    Thank you</li>
<li>Neville Dastur 2019-12-31

    @marian I's say Ti is dead. This ticket was opened in 2012. You really are better off with another framework.</li>
<li>Marian Kucharcik 2019-12-31

    I don't think so. Guys at Axway are doing hard work to make Titanium better and better, so I don't think, that it's dead. Also, community on Ti Slack is strong and helpfull. I tried another frameworks(Cordova, RN, Xamarin) and they were PITA in comparison with Titanium... 
    It's true, that this ticket is old and closed, but maybe now it's time to reopen and reconsider to implement this funcionality...</li>
