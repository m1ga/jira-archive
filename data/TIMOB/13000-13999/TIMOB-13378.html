<h3>Description</h3>

The naming scheme we have for modules is rather inconsistent at the moment. as an example, we have Ti.Mapping and Facebook, but they should follow the same convention. Should we prefix things with Ti or not? Should we use a dot as a separate, or should we use the CommonJS/AMD pattern of slashes? Should we prepend Ti, and if so under what conditions? These questions and more should be formalized in a naming guide document. There are also some technical considerations on some of the platforms, and this could require some changes to them.
