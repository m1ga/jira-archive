   Moving this to Titanium Mobile. This one happens from the command-line as well.
   Instead of the output from the "emulator.exe" should be tunneled to the titanium build process. That way, the Studio will automatically grab and display the output is its console.</li>

   It appears that fixing this will require a significant amount of rework. Deferring from 3.1.0, but would like to get it into 3.1.1 if we can figure out a way to do it without rewriting the Android build scripts just yet.</li>

   Still a problem in Ti Studio 3.1.2.201308091617 and mobile SDK 3.1.2.GA:
   - - Emulator.exe DOS window appears and persists the entire time the emulator is running.
   - - All emulator output (logcat) is captured in that window only and does not appear in the "Console" area of Ti Studio.
   
   In fact, when looking at the "Console" tab at the bottom of Ti Studio, the following log entries (below) appear with the title "Android Emulator Process".  However, shouldn't these log entries show in the subview entitled "Studio Console"?  When I click on the little dropdown that looks like a computer monitor, I get 3 choices: "Studio Console", "FastDev Process", and "Titanium Android Emulator".  And then only the Android emulator output should show in the subview entitled "Titanium Android Emulator".

   [~bitshftr] Thank you. This is going to be addressed with the rewrite of the Android build scripts, happening for 3.2.0</li>
<li>Chris Barber 2013-11-09

   After trying numerous ways around this, there's nothing we can do from Node.js to prevent the terminal window from opening AND detach the process so that the emulator will continue to run after the build completes or is aborted.
   
   I've tried spawning intermediate processes, but that produced the results.
   
   We might have been able to solve it with a small win32 app that spawns it, but that's a lot of work for something that is just an annoyance.
   
   As a workaround, simply launch the Android emulator ahead of time.</li>
<li>Lee Morris 2017-03-22

   Closing ticket as the issue will not fix and with reference to the above comments. A workaround has also been provided.</li>
