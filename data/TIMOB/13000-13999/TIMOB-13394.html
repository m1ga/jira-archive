<h3>Description</h3>

i called 'ti info' to see the installed ti modules and was surprised to see no modules listed.

this is because 'ti info' does not currently list ti modules.

however, there is currently a command to list modules called 'ti modules'.

yea/nay for including ti modules in 'ti info'

yea: ti modules are included with the sdk, seems like basic environment, and this would make the information easily accessible for the larger community and troubleshooting

nay: this could add a lot of extra information, and 'ti modules' does the same thing

   Nay. "ti modules" is meant to some day do more than just list modules. I was thinking it would be the command for downloading and installing modules from GitHub or the Marketplace. It would also handle upgrading and uninstalling modules. Same goes for the "ti plugin" command. So, I would say we should not combine them.</li>

   Sounds like a good reason.</li>
