<h3>Description</h3>

On android there a fireSyncEvent on android.
This is very practical for modules that have a high frequency of event fired and where they need to be treated as soon as possible(i use it for a motion module).
iOs only have a fireEvent.
I looked a little at TiBindingEvent, but was easy enough for me to do it right now ;)
Yet i could really use this in a number of modules.

   Hi Martin, the fireEvent is what we have for iOS, what is it that you're asking for exactly?</li>

   fireEvent is [async](<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchrony)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchrony)</a>!
   For module purpose at least, we need "sync" events.</li>
