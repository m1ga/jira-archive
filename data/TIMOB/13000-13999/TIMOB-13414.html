<h3>Description</h3>

In Android 4.0.3 Turkish Locale causes Application crashes, when the device's language set to english the application works properly. Is there any workaround for this problem.

   Hi aleksi,
   
   Sadly we don't have access to an Android device with the Turkish language natively installed. However, I did try the MoreLocale 2 app which can set the Turkish language, but Titanium apps ran as expected.
   
   What is that commit? How does it relate to Titanium? It seems like a valid change... If you want you can submit a pull request and we'll merge it into our branch.
   
   Thanks.</li>
