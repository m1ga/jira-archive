<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Introduction</h4>
There is a third party Android SDK which internally runs a service which invokes  events to be listened by the native developer using listener methods exposed in the SDK. If a developer is using this SDK then these listeners needs to be added in a Service in the Native Application created so that if the application terminates listeners remain active and listens to the events and can notify the device owner in case event is raised.

We created a module around this SDK to use it in Titanium Application.

<h4>Issue</h4>
In titanium application we created an interval service and declared listeners in the .js file of that interval service. Now the problem is that after execution of .js file by Native service created by Titanium application all the listener objects declared in the .js file are either lost or are garbage collected.As a result listeners does not get called by the third party SDK.

Is there any provision in Titanium so that if an object is created in .js file of service it gets retained till the time service is running?

We referred following resources on appcelerator/github site to create and use service, but our issue is not addressed by these resources:

Please help us on priority as this is affecting our product delivery.
