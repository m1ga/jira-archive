   Hi. Please provide more information, surely there must be something in the logs?</li>
<li>Victor Chu 2012-12-03

   The logs (either .log or the build_blackberry.log) show nothing at all.
   
   One thing I notice is that the Distribute Dialog's second field is the Keys Location. That field is expecting a directory with three CSI files.
   CSI files are for Blackberry 0S 7.x below, not for BB10, which requires two CSJ (not CSI) files.  Maybe this has something to do with it quitting unexpectedly.
   Is this Distribute supposed to work for BB7 or BB10 or both?
   
   I've attached some screenshot of the console.

   Oops forgot to attach the screenshot. How do you attach a screenshot after the issue has been created?
   Anyway, here's the description of the screenshots:
   
   I deleted the contents of the build_blackberry.log and the .log files.
   Then did a distribute Blackberry. I verified that no new data written to both log files.
   The console just says "<terminated> Blackberry Application Packager"
   Usage: <command: build | run | uninstallApp | terminateApp | isAppRunning | printExitCode | getFile | putFile | appLog> -t TYPE -d PROJECT_PATH [-p NDK_PATH] [-i IP_ADDRESS] [-s DEVICE_PASSWORD] [--host_file HOST_FILE] [--device_file DEVICE_FILE]
   
   The debug tab shows "<terminated, exit value: 1> BlackBerry Application Packager"

   Thanks, I've re-opened the issue. You should be able to attach a screenshot now.</li>
<li>Victor Chu 2012-12-04

   Ok, I uploaded the screenshots.
   Also, note I tested this too on the Starter App mentioned in the github link.</li>

   In the new preview blackberry sdk 3.1 (also using titanium studio 3.1), the distribute blackberry does the following:
   
   1) message showing "BlackBerry packaging is not yet implemented."
   2) it doesn't ask for the blackberry keys anymore.

   We have switched from our python builds scripts which includes distribute to a newer node javascript based system it will be released next. I think best for this bug to update to the 3.1.1 Titanium Studio and 3.2 build of BlackBerry SDK. To use command line the GitHub repo <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile_blackberry" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile_blackberry</a> will be updated next week.</li>

   Thus closing the issue.
