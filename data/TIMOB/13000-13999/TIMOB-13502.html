<h3>Description</h3>

*Problem*
When a Ti.UI.iPad.createPopover uses a LEFT or RIGHT arrow, the popover seems to be the wrong size. Some of my content is being cut off. 
UP and DOWN work as expected. 

Orientation seems to make no difference. (problem is in landscape or portrait)

Suggestion of where to patch TiSDK would be welcome, as this is a bit of a blocker for me. 

*Steps to reproduce*
1. Copy and paste code provided into app.js
2. Run on iPad simulator
3. Click left side button, notice popover functionality as expected
4. Click right side button, notice popover content being cut off

   new info: in my app (where i first saw the bug) I just noticed that if the popover is displaying in it's buggy mode (with arrow on the LEFT) if i then change orientation of the device, when it redraws, the popover looks correct. So hopefully that will help.

   For some reason, this issue seems to be related to the hard-coded left and right values.
   
   When I change view and popover to use width of Ti.UI.FILL, or simply omit the size values, the popover appears to work correctly. So it seems like it's specifically the combination of the hard-coded left and right values with the right arrow that's causing the problem.</li>
