<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>New feature description</h4>

It would be really useful to determine at runtime what sort of build was running. I.e. debug / adhoc / store build.

I know that determining a simulator build is easy, but it would be very helpful to differentiate between adhoc and store builds. Mainly so that it is easy to have beta test code if'd out in store release. I would suggest an addition to Ti.Platform.buildType

   This would come in handy when we do TIMOB-13396 which allows deploy-type to be overridden for <code>dist-adhoc</code> and <code>dist-appstore</code>.</li>
