<h3>Description</h3>

See [my screencast](<a href="https://vimeo.com/63740196)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://vimeo.com/63740196)</a> for an example of what I mean. You see the problem about 20 seconds into the video.

It seems to mostly happen when scrolling the tableview causes the selected row to go off screen. When you scroll to bring that row back onto the screen and then select a new row the previously selected row's highlightedColor stays instead of switching back to the regular color. It doesn't happen every time, but this is the the best way I've found to replicate.

   Hi,
   
   I could reproduce it with 3.0.2 GA, but I tried 3.1 CI and it doesn't seem to be happening anymore -- actually I got it to happen once, but it quickly went back to the correct colour.
   
   Can you try the latest 3.1 from: <a href="http://builds.appcelerator.com/#3_1_X" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://builds.appcelerator.com/#3_1_X</a>
   
   Thanks!</li>

   Hi,
   
   I tried the latest 3.1 and it still happens. It's not as frequent, but you can see in this [latest screencast](<a href="https://vimeo.com/63762906)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://vimeo.com/63762906)</a> that I still got it to happen twice within a pretty short period of time. The different with 3.1 is that after it happens you can scroll the stuck row off and back on the screen again and it fixes itself. This is still a bug, though.
   
   Thanks,
