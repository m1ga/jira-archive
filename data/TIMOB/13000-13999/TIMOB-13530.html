<h3>Description</h3>

SeparatorColor property for ListView is currently planned for v2.

ListViews currently show black separators on Android, grey separators on iOS.

However, it is quite unlikely that an existing app, which might have a lot of TableViews with custom separatorColors (e.g. to follow color guidelines for the app brand), can be updated to use ListView with those default colors.

While many other v2 features can be simulated in v1, or manually added with additional coding, the lack of separatorColor forces a VISUAL limitation which cannot be circumvented.

Please consider including separatorColor in 3.1 GA

   This is not going to happen for 3.1.0 as we cannot accept any new features at this time. We will consider it for 3.1.1.</li>

   Thank you, the Banzai mobile team was inquiring about this and I suggested they create a new feature request. I will make sure they get this info.

   You can copy the method from TiUITableView.m and paste into TiUIListView.m
   
   <code><pre>
   -(void)setSeparatorColor_:(id)arg
   {
   	TiColor *color = [TiUtils colorValue:arg];
   	[[self tableView] setSeparatorColor:[color _color]];
   }
   </pre></code></li>

   @Danny Pham, thanks! 
   Do you have code snippet for Android as well?</li>

   Marking as a duplicate of the main ticket since we don't normally break out separate feature implementations. Please follow along there.</li>

   Please do consider this for 3.1.1. It would appear to be a well defined small code change and as the OP says it can not be worked around, unlikely a lot of the other v2 planned features.
   
   Thank you</li>
