<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Description:</h4>
Code-signing an app with an appstore distribution provision should not allow the app to run on device. In our case it did. When removing installed provisions on the device, we were only unable to install the app (as expected) when no provisions were present. The last one removed was an adhoc provision. We attempted to use each of our active provisions, and only our adhoc provision allowed app installation, indicating that the app was somehow associated with this provision.

We opened the .ipa produced and looked at the embedded provision, which seemed accurate.
We also verified on the Apple Developer site that the provision we used was in fact NOT an Adhoc provision, but a App store provision.

This occurs with both studio and CLI builds

<h4>Test steps:</h4>
1. Create a project
2. Distribute via studio with: Adhoc/Enterprise option, using an iOS app store provisioning profile. (or use CLI target dist-appstore)
3. Open Xcode and try to add the App to a device
4. Run the app on device

<h4>Result:</h4>
The app will install and run if an adhoc provision is available on the device

<h4>Expected:</h4>
Failure to install the app since the provision is app-store only.

   [~emerriman] Is this really Titanium's fault? Shouldn't this be an issue with Xcode?</li>
<li>Chris Barber 2016-08-30

   I could not reproduce this with Titanium SDK 5.5.0 and Xcode 7.3.1.</li>
