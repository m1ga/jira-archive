   I cannot reproduce this issue if I follow the steps. 
   However, dragging of the .apk file to the terminal after "adb install" will reproduce the issue.
   The reason is the one space character in the end of the command.
   
   Test steps:
   1. Following the test steps *typing* 
    adb install timob-13639.apk 
   3277 KB/s (6612994 bytes in 1.970s)
   	pkg: /data/local/tmp/timob-13639.apk
   Success
   2. Dragging of the file after (adb install)
   .......$ adb install /Users/oromero/Desktop/timob-13639.apk(space is here)  
   2915 KB/s (6612994 bytes in 2.215s)
   	pkg: /data/local/tmp/timob-13639.a......$
   Failure [INSTALL_FAILED_ALREADY_EXISTS]
   
   Note: deleting this space results in successful installation.

   I can't reproduce this issue.  I packaged KS (which has the facebook module installed) and it was able to install fine.
   
   If you do 'adb install KitchenSink.apk' more than once, then you do get the 'INSTALL_FAILED_ALREADY_EXISTS' error.  This is expected since you already installed the app.
   
   If you run into this, I would just uninstall the app: 'adb uninstall <appid>', and then try reinstalling.</li>

   The native android behavior is to throw this error when you have a packaged app already installed and you try to install it again. To avoid the chance that there is something else going on here, please try to reproduce and if your results match our expectations (if a production app exists with the same app ID, you can't install) we will close. If not we will reopen.</li>

   Tested with: 
   SDK:3.1.2.v20130624104600
   Appcelerator Studio: 3.1.1.201306131423
   OS: OSX 10.7.5
   Device:HTC desire(4.0.3)
   
   works as expected</li>
