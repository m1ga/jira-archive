<h3>Description</h3>

According to the [documentation](<a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#</a>!/api/Titanium.UI.DashboardView-event-delete), the delete event for DashboardView is

Fired when an item is deleted in edit mode.
{quote}

However, a delete event will be fired for every item in a dashboardview even when not in edit mode. If you, for example, called <code>setData()</code> programmatically to reset the DashboardView, an individual delete event is fired for all items that are going to be replaced, which probably doesn't make sense in the context of a wholesale replace. It is also pretty noisy. In addition, <code>setData()</code> is used by Alloy data binding to reset the dashboard when the model is updated.

   I can confirm this bug is still present. Clicking a dashboard item when not in edit mode fires the delete event. It seems also to be fired when existing edit mode (not sure if it fires before or after the commit event).</li>
