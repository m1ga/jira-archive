<h3>Description</h3>

For Alloy projects, the Resources folder should not be touched - its generated code, so typically it is left out of GIT repos. 

This causes a problem when trying to build a project imported from GIT - the application will fail to compile due to the Resources folder not being present.

To reproduce: 
- Import an Alloy based Titanium project from github, make sure there is no resources folder stored there
- Build / Run the project

Actual:
Build fails due to missing resources file

Expected: 
Titanium Studio should detect the missing resources folder and rebuild using the Alloy standard folder structure

   Cannot reproduce using Titanium SDK 5.5.0 and Alloy 1.9.1. No idea when this was fixed, but I'm almost certain the problem was in Alloy, not the Titanium build.</li>

   Closing ticket as the issue cannot be reproduced.</li>
