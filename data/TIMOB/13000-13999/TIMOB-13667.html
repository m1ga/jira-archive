   Hi Mike,
   
   Please can you clarify the following:
   
   {quote}I created and deployed an app successfully in titanium studio; however, when I try to build the same app I get the following error:{quote}
   You're saying you deployed it successfully, and then you say you got a build error?
   
   And does this occur for every one of your projects, or just one? Can you try running one of the template projects?
   
   Thanks.</li>

   Hi Daniel,
   
   I imported the Kitchen Sink app in Titanium studio and was able to build the project and deploy it to an Android emulator from inside the IDE. I then tried to build and deploy that same project using the CLI and got the same error that was posted above. Next, I tried creating a new project using the CLI, thinking that there might have been some compatability issue between Titanium studio and the CLI, and when I ran the build command in I got the output listed above.
   
   I am having the same issue regardless of which project I try to build. I don't seem to have any problem building them through Titanium studio but when I try to build them from the CLI I keep getting the same error. 
   
   Hope this helps.</li>

   You need to make sure python 2.7 is installed and is in your system path.</li>
