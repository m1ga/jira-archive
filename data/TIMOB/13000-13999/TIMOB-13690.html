   Tested with:
   Appcelerator Studio, build: 3.1.1.201305292130
   SDK, build: 3.1.1.v20130529114554
   
   Galaxy S4 4.2.2
   Nexus7 4.2
   
   I can reproduce the issue, no break points in app.js> debug as Android device.

   This is what i have found till now.
   
   This occurs if try closing the debugger connection while the app is in the middle of booting up. if you close the connection afterwards the app quits as expected. 
   
   To consistently reproduce the issue, i used KS. and tested all the way back up to 3.0.2.GA and it has the same behavior. So i don't think this should be a regression as this has always been the behavior.
   
   I also did testing in TiStudio 3.1.0.GA and still happens. 
   
   We believe this bug is due to the current window architecture and would be fixed once new the window behavior is implemented.

   Removing the regression tag based on Sabil's comments.</li>

   Tested KS with the latest master and 3_1_X branch. This issue does not happen any more. After the debugger is terminated, the app will not freeze and have no ANR error although the splash screen still shows. Probably fixed by TIMOB-12939. Resolve the ticket as Cannot Reproduce.</li>
