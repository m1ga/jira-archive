<h3>Description</h3>

*Problem description*
If you have a /Resources/fonts/ directory with custom fonts in it, and define those fonts in tiapp.xml 's new <ios> directive, the fonts directory is not copied over to the build.

*Test case*
<code><pre>
    &lt;ios&gt;
        &lt;min-ios-ver&gt;4.3&lt;/min-ios-ver&gt;
        &lt;plist&gt;
            &lt;dict&gt;
                &lt;key&gt;UIStatusBarStyle&lt;/key&gt;
                &lt;string&gt;UIStatusBarStyleBlackOpaque&lt;/string&gt;
                &lt;key&gt;UIAppFonts&lt;/key&gt;
                &lt;array&gt;
                    &lt;string&gt;/fonts/MyFont_1.otf&lt;/string&gt;
                    &lt;string&gt;/fonts/MyFont_2.ttf&lt;/string&gt;
                &lt;/array&gt;
            &lt;/dict&gt;
        &lt;/plist&gt;
    &lt;/ios&gt;
</pre></code>

*Workaround*
If you copy the fonts/ directory to /platform/iphone/ and /platform/android/ they are included in the build.

   Just some thoughts if you're around before we test this... So if you *don't* define those fonts with UIAppFonts, the Resources/fonts/ directory is copied to the build as expected? I'd think this is expected behavior anyway, since the <ios> directive is platform specific, so any folders it references will be platform specific. I can see the need for a global fonts folder though.
   
   You also mention the Android directory - does it not copy it on Android either?</li>

   According to the docs ([<a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#</a>!/guide/Custom_Fonts]), you need a custom info.plist... I would have assumed that using the new <ios> directive would supersede that. If the new expected behavior is to not do anything other than have a "fonts" directory, the docs should say this (and this ticket should be a Docs issue).
   
   I'm afraid I don't have my project up at the moment, so I can't provide quick answers to your questions.</li>
<li>Daniel Sefton 2013-04-29

   I'm 99% sure it's expected behavior that you should include the fonts directory in the /iphone directory anyway. Do you have any problems with this? About the docs... So you'd like the docs to be updated to describe adding fonts with the new <ios> directive (and of course cover the fact that the fonts directory should be included in the platform specific folders)?</li>
<li>Shannon Hicks 2013-04-29

   Well, the bottom line is that we need accurate instructions on how to use custom fonts, regardless of what those instructions are. You've now mentioned a second "expected", yet undocumented behavior... the need to put fonts in the /iphone directory.
   
   [Using the custom font](<a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#</a>!/guide/Custom_Fonts-section-29004935_CustomFonts-Usingthecustomfont):

   2. Copy the TTF/OTF file to the Resources/fonts/ directory.
   If you want to use different fonts on iOS than Android, you can copy those files to Resources/iphone/fonts and Resources/android/fonts instead.

   So, if the documentation is all wrong, then it needs to get fixed in 3.1.1. If there's an actual Ti SDK bug, well, ditto.</li>

   Ah I see. I'll get our team to look at it from the platform side first. Thanks.</li>

   This has been fixed by TIMOB-13859. In TIMOB-13859, there was a bug with files not being symlinked properly, some files being copied twice, and some files not copied at all. Turns out that the fix for TIMOB-13859 also fixes this ticket. :)
   
   TIMOB-13859 was merged into master and 3_1_X and will be available in 3.1.1.GA.</li>
