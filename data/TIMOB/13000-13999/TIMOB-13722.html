<h3>Description</h3>

When you download a module from the marketplace or github, in order to have it work in a project, you need to add it to that project.

But "Core" Modules, which really are part of our SDK, you should not have to "add" the module to the project.  If you use the API, then the module should automatically be added to the project.  If the the API is not used, then it shouldn't be there.  

"Core" module should work like regular APIs, or as close as possible to regular APIs.  The end user shouldn't have to know that they are built as modules.

Today they are provided on the marketplace, but in the near future they will be packaged with the SDK.

   Important, but I don't believe we are making any additional changes to this in the 3.3.0 timeframe.</li>

   All, how do we decide what's a core module? [~rblalock], [~aleard] thoughts?</li>

   Simple:  Get a bunch of chicken bones, write the names of our modules on each one.  Draw a circle on the ground.  Throw the bones on the ground.  Whichever land inside the circle are core modules.
   
   Seriously though:  There's nothing in this Jira to indicate what was meant by "core module".  :-(  I assume this ticket is referring to all of these right?  <a href="https://marketplace.appcelerator.com/listing?q=Appcelerator#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://marketplace.appcelerator.com/listing?q=Appcelerator#</a>!/list/page/1/search=Appcelerator
   
   I think a lot of this is open to debate.  I looked through them all and like that they are separate and don't have to be distributed with the SDK.  MAYBE the payment ones that come with the OS would make sense (MAYBE).  Maybe AirPrint.  But I think its debatable that those should even be included.
   
   Is there a back story I'm missing?</li>
