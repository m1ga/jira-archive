If you use the API, then the module should automatically be added to the project.  If the the API is not used, then it shouldn't be there.  \r\n\r\n\"Core\" module should work like regular APIs, or as close as possible to regular APIs.  The end user shouldn't have to know that they are built as modules.\r\n\r\nToday they are provided on the marketplace, but in the near future they will be packaged with the SDK.\r\n\r\n",

					"body": "Simple:  Get a bunch of chicken bones, write the names of our modules on each one.  Draw a circle on the ground.  Throw the bones on the ground.  Whichever land inside the circle are core modules.\r\n\r\nSeriously though:  There's nothing in this Jira to indicate what was meant by \"core module\".  :-(  I assume this ticket is referring to all of these right?  https://marketplace.appcelerator.com/listing?q=Appcelerator#!/list/page/1/search=Appcelerator\r\n\r\nI think a lot of this is open to debate.  I looked through them all and like that they are separate and don't have to be distributed with the SDK.  MAYBE the payment ones that come with the OS would make sense (MAYBE).  Maybe AirPrint.  But I think its debatable that those should even be included.\r\n\r\nIs there a back story I'm missing?",
