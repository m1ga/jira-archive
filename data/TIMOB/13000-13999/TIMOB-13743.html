<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Description:</h4>
While testing liveview, I attempted to run on Android emulator and on Android device. Both failed. My first emulator run failed with a red runtime error screen complaining of a timeout. This is similar to the attached image from device.

The second run and subsequent runs of the emulator launched and ran, but changes did not show in the emulator. The console reported the changed files however:
<code><pre>
[32m [INFO][39m  Reload Triggered
[90m 	-REASON:[39m  File Changed
[90m  -FILE:[39m  /Users/emerriman/Documents/workspace/mayworkspace/basicNoServ/Resources/app.js
</pre></code>

attempting to install on works, but when the app is auto-launched, it fails with the error shown in the attachment

<h4>Steps to reproduce:</h4>
1) Navigate to the studio install location for liveview and run "./liveview-server stop"
2) Launch a project without crittercism for Android emulator liveview enabled
3) Change the app.js code

part two:
Launch liveview session on android device

<h4>Result:</h4>
Emulator will not show any changes although the console shows the file listener is functioning

part two: error as shown in attachment

<h4>Expected Result:</h4>
Code changes appear in the emulator
Device build runs and shows code changes

   This should be fixed. Test with LiveView v0.1.10</li>
<li>Christian Sullivan 2013-05-02

   This issue is cause by criticism injecting code in to the app.js. The criticism module needs to be updated to comply with the cli build hooks system.</li>
