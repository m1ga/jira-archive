<h3>Description</h3>

If you set the width of a button to be smaller than it "should" be, the text gets truncated, which is expected. But if you set it to be bigger, only the container that contains the button gets wider while the button stays at its preferred width. The button width needs to be the width that I tell it to be.

   Yes there are some controls on BlackBerry that have size restrictions.
   I think this is okay if we document this specific BB behavior.
   Sometimes it's okay to break parity if the UI guidelines for the platform
   or any restrictions give good reason.
   
   The only workaround for this would be a custom control, but I don't like that idea.
   I'd rather use the native UI components when possible.</li>
