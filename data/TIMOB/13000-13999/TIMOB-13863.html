<h3>Description</h3>

If show/hide buttons are clicked quickly few times, search box comes in intermediate position where it's neither hidden nor shown.
This is not regression since the issue occurs in 3.1.0 GA as well.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Go to Kitchensink>Base UI> Views> Tableviews>Table Search
2. Click on hide and show button few times quickly.

Actual:
search box comes in intermediate position where it's neither hidden nor shown. Now, at this state, if hide is clicked, the search box gets hidden and if show is clicked, box is fully shown. Please find the screenshot attached.

Expected:
The search box should attain one position (hide/ show) completely.

   This is a test case issue, this is because of a timing issue where multiple shows and hide happen and it gets into a inconsistent state. Will set up KS PR to address the issue. </li>

   The is edge case and not likely to happen in actual app. </li>
