<h3>Description</h3>

Inactivity Timer for receiving an event if the user has not interacted with the app for a period of time

Any app that displays sensitive data should be able to have a timeout so that if the user does not interact with the device for a period of time, the app can log the user out or close down. This is common for banking and brokerage apps both on the web and on mobile versions. It is also very important for Enterprise apps that may provide an offline experience and authenticate a user offline.

While this may be achievable by the programmer today manually, it is very onerous since the developer would ned to reset the timer on every user action (button click, page swipe, list item click, etc...). It would be better for this to be a platform feature that is enable and configured by the developer and then have the platform generate the inactivity timer event and the developer can popup a reminder to the user or logout or shut down the app.
