<h3>Description</h3>

*Problem*
Please can you add support of "Hint text" property in TextArea component also for iOS? Now it is working only on Android and I don't understand why.

In my app I have a nice form with normal TextField's (with hint text) and on the end of the form I've got a TextArea, which is without hint text, so it looks inconsistent.

There is a workaround by manually checking the values, but this is inconvenient.

*Workaround*
<code><pre>
var textArea = Titanium.UI.createTextArea({
	value : 'Enter Text',
});
textArea._hintText = textArea.value;

textArea.addEventListener('focus', function(e) {
	if (e.source.value == e.source._hintText) {
		e.source.value = "";
	}
});
textArea.addEventListener('blur', function(e) {
	if (e.source.value == "") {
		e.source.value = e.source._hintText;
	}
});
</pre></code>

   Separated into 2 reports for iOS and Mobile Web (TIMOB-13904).</li>

   @Matej  - If you'd like to help us further on this, a simple test case which demonstrates the parity would be useful.
   
   Thanks.</li>
<li>Matej 2013-05-17

   Sorry I don't know what exactly do you want. Do you want me to use 'workaround' in test case? I am not sure if is it necessarily - example for hintext/placeholder...
   
   + I forgot. But for example I can't use 'workaround' in my application because (I wrote it already above) I've got a few TextField's in my form with HinText. Problem is that TextArea has different distance between border / text and as well TextArea has different type of font. So it doesn't looks very well... :(</li>

   Just something which shows that the hint text for TextArea is working on Android and not iOS.
   
   For your second point, I think that resembles a bigger issue. If you use hint text on Android do you have the same issue? Even with the entry text?</li>

   OK, so:
   
   *app.js* (hintText sample)
   <code><pre> 
   var win = Ti.UI.createWindow({
   	layout: "vertical",
   	backgroundColor: "gray"
   });
   
   var textField = Ti.UI.createTextField({
   	width: 250, height: 50,
   	top: 10,
   	hintText: "Hint text",
   	backgroundColor: "white"
   });
   
   var textArea = Ti.UI.createTextArea({
   	width: 250, height: 50,
   	top: 50,
   	hintText: "Hint text",
   	backgroundColor: "white"
   });
   
   
   win.add(textField);
   win.add(textArea);
   win.open();
   </pre></code>
   
   *Screens:* (I have no idea why is font on the Android so high... )

   *app.js* (Test only with value)
   <code><pre>
   var win = Ti.UI.createWindow({
   	layout: "vertical",
   	backgroundColor: "gray"
   });
   
   var textField = Ti.UI.createTextField({
   	width: 250, height: 50,
   	top: 10,
   	value: "Some value",
   	backgroundColor: "white"
   });
   
   var textArea = Ti.UI.createTextArea({
   	width: 250, height: 50,
   	top: 50,
   	value: "Some value",
   	backgroundColor: "white"
   });
   
   
   win.add(textField);
   win.add(textArea);
   win.open();
   </pre></code>

   *app.js* (Same test with values ,but I added font size/weight. You can see that font is exactly same ,but there is space in TextArea between font and border/side)
   <code><pre>
   var win = Ti.UI.createWindow({
   	layout: "vertical",
   	backgroundColor: "gray"
   });
   
   var textField = Ti.UI.createTextField({
   	width: 250, height: 50,
   	top: 10,
   	value: "Some value",
   	font: {fontSize: 20, fontWeight:"normal"},
   	backgroundColor: "white"
   });
   
   var textArea = Ti.UI.createTextArea({
   	width: 250, height: 50,
   	top: 50,
   	value: "Some value",
   	font: {fontSize: 20, fontWeight:"normal"},
   	backgroundColor: "white"
   });
   
   
   win.add(textField);
   win.add(textArea);
   win.open();
   </pre></code>

   OK, and in the last sample I set in the TextField normal hintText and in the textArea I set custom hintText by 'workaround' + I changed color. Everything else including font size/weight is same like in the previous example.

   Thanks Matej, very useful.</li>

   This issue has not had much attention lately. It does however seem pretty trivial. Is there a way this feature could be included soon?</li>
<li>Trevor Chong 2015-01-14

   Yes. Agreed. It is a simple feature which a lot of developers use. It would save the community a lot of work.
   
   </li>
<li>Hans Kn√∂chel 2016-08-14

    Unfortunately, it is no dimple feature, since iOS does not expose an API for it and Apple does not plan to do so. The simple reason is that a <code>UITextView</code> is not meant to have placeholder-texts natively. Because we try to stick to the native API-guidelines, we won't expose it as well. 
    
    But If you still want to use it, you could do it by simply watching the focus-event of the text-field and adjust the text and color property based on the file-length. 
    
    It's a UI-hack, but that's also how it is suggested by the iOS-community on the native-side.
