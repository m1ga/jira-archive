<h3>Description</h3>

The current versioning scheme for node-appc doesn't allow for multi-branch development like the other products do (e.g. there's no way to work on 3.2.0 and 3.1.1 at the same time). We need to bump to version 1.0.0 and increment the minor version to coincide with the SDK minor version increases.

Note: all other projects that depend on node-appc will need to update their package.json dependencies to match.

   I don't think node-appc will be bumped to 1.0 for TiSDK 3.2. I don't think we need multi-branch dev unless there is something we change in node-appc that breaks backwards compatibility. If anything, node-appc might see a 0.2 for 3.2.</li>

   I'm marking this as invalid since we now have 3_1_X and 3_2_X branches and things seem to be working smoothly.</li>
