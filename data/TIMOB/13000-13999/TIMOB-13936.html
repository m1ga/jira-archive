<h3>Description</h3>

Right now, the only way to have a SearchView in the ActionBar is to also have it tied to the search on a TableView. I need to be able to do remote API searches via a SearchView in the ActionBar.

Perhaps now is the time to tweak TableView.search to fire a search event instead of only filtering? This would allow us to accomplish the same thing, right? Even better, that would allow for some great UI even if the data is remote.

   This is indeed a major problem, however the solution is not to tweak TableView.search, but rather to simply allow SearchView to be used without TableView. Please don't complicate the solution. Thanks.</li>

   Hitting this issue today. Massive setback with regards to creating a professional looking android app. We will be forced to either place a searchView outside of the action bar or implement our own actionBar. Please prioritise this.</li>

   @Brian Hoary: you can work around this: use a TableView and set its visibility to false.</li>

   @Mark M: Hi Mark. That work around seems to work fine for us. Thanks.</li>
