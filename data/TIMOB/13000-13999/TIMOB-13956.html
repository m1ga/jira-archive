<h3>Description</h3>

This is an umbrella ticket for creating the architecture specification for a new Titanium Runtime, which is the mobile platform upon which a Titanium Application executes.

The Titanium Runtime is the collection of software that runs on a mobile device which provides the common services required by a Titanium Application. This specification will be created by a tiger team assembled by Neeraj which is charged with completing the initial version of the spec by the end of June 2013 that will be of suitable detail and quality as to allow an engineering team to implement a prototype of the Titanium Runtime on a Windows 8 Mobile device.

The specification is being collaboratively documented on the [Titanium Runtime wiki](<a href="https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/coreruntime/Titanium+Runtime)." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/coreruntime/Titanium+Runtime).</a>

This is a high-level diagram showing where the Titanium Runtime fits into the overall component architecture:
