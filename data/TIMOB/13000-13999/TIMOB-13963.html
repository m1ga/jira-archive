<h3>Description</h3>

Currently the analytics events are set to send events every 10 min which according to blain's comment " if the queue was empty, analytics waits 5 seconds for other events to come in before sending to the server. On a server issue, the wait for trying again is 15 seconds." should be much less to be in parity with other platforms.
