		"description": "Write blog post(s) about our new focus on performance improvements, what customers will notice in 3.1.X, and what they can expect in future releases. \r\n\r\nOur post(s) might want to include not only the recent improvements to the platform, but also simple things that our customers can measure and do today that future Appcelerator enhancements (e.g. an upcoming js compiler) will/may automate in the future. \r\n\r\nThis is the Platform Performance Improvements wiki with the results of several performance experiments:\r\nhttps://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/spe/Platform+Performance+Improvements\r\n\r\nThe Mobile Web performance improvements from Chris Barber should also be considered. Before Chris' changes, Mobile Web was already architected by some of the best JavaScript engineers in the industry. However, given a data driven approach, 25 hours of effort, and solid engineering skills, all aspects of a platform could be improved be over an order of magnitude. This is enormous and rare.\r\n\r\nA blog post should be written about this effort to benefit not just internal engineers, but our customer base as a whole. I have seen on multiple occasions that customer's with real-world apps having performance and memory pressure issues could be helped by using  simple measurement techniques to zero-in on the problem followed by the application of simple, time-tested software engineering techniques to remedy the problem. It would be a great case study to see how two very experienced JavaScript engineers increased a platform's performance by an order of magnitude using this approach.",
