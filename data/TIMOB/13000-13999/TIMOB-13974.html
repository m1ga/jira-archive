<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Description:</h4>
While verifying some JIRA tickets I was packaging KS (from 3.1.X branch). Hieu reported having this take a long time, so I monitored the process.

The console ticked slowly away, and it took 9 minutes and 30 seconds to finish the task. This was from clean.

<h4>Steps to reproduce:</h4>
1) Pull KS from 3_1_X branch
2) Import into Studio
3) Package for distribution
4) Monitor the duration of the task

<h4>Result:</h4>
It took 9:30 in my first test and others have reported longer.

<h4>Expected Result:</h4>
Much quicker packaging process.

<h4>Notes:</h4>
I'll be checking to see if this is a regression and will add it here.

   I tried moving the SDK the CLI and the selected SDK in the CLI to 3.1.0.GA. Same result. I will try an older KS version.

   For me it was:
    
   7:30 with 3.1.0.GA
   7:54 with 3.1.1.v20130523170057
   
   Titanium Studio, build: 3.1.1.201305222018
   Mac osx 10.8.3 Mountail Lion
   KS 3_1_X branch
   
   I will test 3_0_X KS branch. This is the way to test older SDKs.

   This is closure compiler related.</li>

   The new Android build uses UglifyJS and it's way faster than the Google Closure compiler.</li>

   Just tried this on the new Android Build and it took around 30 sec.</li>
