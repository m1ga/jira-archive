   I don't think this is a regression (at least on the platform).  I tried with the same version of KS on 3.0.0.GA, 3.1.0.GA, and 3.1.1 and I get the same behavior.
   
   It seems more like a KS bug more than a platform bug.  It could be a KS regression.</li>

   This looks like a test case issue. The KS code loops through the addresses for a contact, and in cases where there is more than one, they both (or more) get the same "top" property, so are drawn on top of each other.
   
   You will not see this issue in cases where there is only one address.</li>

   Resolving ticket as Invalid as there is now a new version of Kitchen Sink available and we no longer support the version which relates to this ticket.</li>
