<h3>Description</h3>

The action bar should offers drop-down navigation like in native Android. The drop-down list can offer different modes by which content in the activity is sorted. Attached is an image of an example of drop-down list in action bar in Android.

   +1 for this feature. The ActionBar has been used by Android since 3.0 which was released over 3 YEARS AGO. There is no way any iOS feature would go totally unsupported for over 3 years.

   [~vlucas] Thank you for the update. We prioritize features based on a number of factors, including watchers, and this ticket has not (yet) received a lot of interest. If you can help garner support for this feature, it will help with our prioritization.</li>

   This appears to have been addressed here: TIMOB-13135</li>

   We've had a request for this feature as part of a proof point for a big prospect. We definitely need to support this.</li>

   [~ralcocer], is this really a duplicate of TIMOB-13135? It just seems related.</li>

   There's VERY basic support for this in ActionBarExtras : <a href="https://github.com/ricardoalcocer/actionbarextras" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/ricardoalcocer/actionbarextras</a>
