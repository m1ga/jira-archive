<h3>Description</h3>

Description:
I .Do the following on appcelerator studio:

1. Clone the field service app from github & import it into appcelerator studio
2. Now make sure you have BlackBerry environment setup in the studio preferences
3. Now enable the Blackberry target & do a save

Observed after step 3 : After doing a save & as BB target has been enabled we should get a BB folder in the resources folder of the field service app. But, in my case I do not see any BB folder under resources.

4. Now manually add a BB folder by copy paste from any other alloy project
5. Save & build for BB device/simulator

Observed after step 5 : The manually added BB folder automatically gets deleted & the build fails giving errors like this:
<code><pre>
Error: ENOENT, no such file or directory '/Users/lokeshchoudhary/Desktop/Repositories/Field-Service-App/Resources/blackberry'
</pre></code>


II. Do the following on titanium studio:

1. Clone the field service app from github & import it into titanium studio
2. Now make sure you have BlackBerry environment setup in the studio preferences
3. Now enable the Blackberry target & do a save

Observed after step 3 : After doing a save & as BB target has been enabled we should get a BB folder in the resources folder of the field service app. In my case I do see the BB folder gets created under resources

4. Build for BB device/simulator

Observed after step 4 : The Blackberry folder under resources gets deleted which fails the build


Actual Result:
1. The field service app fails to build as the BlackBerry folder in resources gets deleted automatically in both appcelerator & titanium studio.

Expected Result:
1. The field service app should build successfully for both appcelerator & titanium studio
