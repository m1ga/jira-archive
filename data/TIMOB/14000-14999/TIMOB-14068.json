When user creates the project with selected platforms, the following command is run:\n\n{code}\n\"/usr/local/bin/titanium\" \"--no-colors\" \"--no-prompt\" \"--no-banner\" \"create\" \"--platforms\" \"ios,android,mobileweb,tizen\" \"--type\" \"app\" \"--id\" \"testbb.test\" \"--sdk\" \"3.1.1.v20130530171546\" \"--workspace-dir\" \"/Users/mxia/Documents/Titanium_Studio_Workspace\" \"--name\" \"testbb\" \"--verbose\" \"--force\"\n{code}\n\nAt the end of the run, Resources folder contains the following files and directories:\n\n-rw-r--r--  1 mxia  staff  1158 May 30 21:21 KS_nav_ui.png\n-rw-r--r--  1 mxia  staff  1074 May 30 21:21 KS_nav_views.png\ndrwxr-xr-x  5 mxia  staff   170 May 30 21:21 android\n-rw-r--r--  1 mxia  staff  1164 May 30 21:21 app.js\ndrwxr-xr-x  8 mxia  staff   272 May 30 21:21 iphone\ndrwxr-xr-x  5 mxia  staff   170 May 30 21:21 mobileweb\ndrwxr-xr-x  3 mxia  staff   102 May 30 21:21 tizen\n\nThere is no blackberry directory since BB isn't included; expected result.\n\n2. Then this command is run:\n\n{code}\n\"/usr/local/bin/alloy\" \"new\" \"/Users/mxia/Documents/Titanium_Studio_Workspace/testbb\" \"default\"\n{code}\n\nThis creates the app directory under project root. It has an \"assets\" folder, which in turn contains android, iphone, blackberry, and mobileweb. Only the blackberry one is empty. From Tony's latest comment in the ticket, this is expected as well since Resources/blackberry folder is not there.\n\n3. Now user enables BlackBerry in the tiapp.xml and saves, the following command is called:\n\n{code}\n\"/usr/local/bin/titanium\" \"--no-colors\" \"--no-prompt\" \"--no-banner\" \"project\" \"--sdk\" \"3.1.1.v20130530171546\" \"--project-dir\" \"/Users/mxia/Documents/Titanium_Studio_Workspace/testbb\" \"deployment-targets\" \"blackberry,tizen,mobileweb,android,iphone,iPad\"\n{code}\n\nIt copies the BB assets from the SDK to the Resources directory so Resources/blackberry/ folder contains content. The app/assets/blackberry folder remains empty.\n\n4. Finally Studio runs the build command:\n\n{code}\n\"/usr/local/bin/titanium\" \"--no-colors\" \"--no-prompt\" \"build\" \"--platform\" \"blackberry\" \"--sdk\" \"3.1.1.v20130530171546\" \"--log-level\" \"trace\" \"--target\" \"simulator\" \"--ndk\" \"/Applications/bbndk\" \"--ip-address\" \"192.168.163.135\"\n{code}\n\nAnd here are the outputs at the end:\n\n[Command] :source /Applications/bbndk/bbndk-env.sh && blackberry-deploy -installApp -launchApp -device 192.168.163.135 -package \"/Users/mxia/Documents/Titanium_Studio_Workspace/testbb/build/blackberry/x86/o-g/testbb.bar\" \nError: Command failed: Warning: Using default icon: /Applications/bbndk/host_10_1_0_132/darwin/x86/usr/samples/icons/blackberry-tablet-default-icon.png\nError: Attribute image: file cannot be found in the list of packaged files: assets/splash-600x1024.png \n\nWarning: Using default icon: /Applications/bbndk/host_10_1_0_132/darwin/x86/usr/samples/icons/blackberry-tablet-default-icon.png\nError: Attribute image: file cannot be found in the list of packaged files: assets/splash-600x1024.png \n\n\nError: Command failed: Error: File does not exist or not a file or cannot read: /Users/mxia/Documents/Titanium_Studio_Workspace/testbb/build/blackberry/x86/o-g/testbb.bar \n\nError: File does not exist or not a file or cannot read: /Users/mxia/Documents/Titanium_Studio_Workspace/testbb/build/blackberry/x86/o-g/testbb.bar \n\n\nIf we check the Resources/blackberry/ folder now, it becomes empty again. My suspicion is that the build script copies from assets folder instead of respecting the existing content in Resources, thus wiping it out since assets folder is empty.\n\nThe solution to me seems to be that we should call \"alloy new\" again after step 3 to copy the content from Resources to assets again; however, I tried that from command line and it failed because app folder already exists. Then the next suggestion is for the build script to respect the existing content in Resources if they don't exist in the corresponding assets folder. Either way, we would need help from the platform team since Studio doesn't call \"alloy new\" directly or interfere with the build command.\n",

					"body": "So I can make a change to Alloy to add the SDK's Resources for BB like I have for iphone, android, and mobileweb, *BUT* this only helps when \"alloy new\" is called, which should not be called every time a new platform is added to a project. This would, as its name states, create a new Alloy project from scratch, using the given template. So if this was an existing project with work in it, it would get blown away. So \"alloy new\" should not be part of Studio's workflow every time someone adds a platform to an existing project, only on initial project creation. So, while this is an important note, I don't think it solves this issue.\r\n\r\nWe have a couple options, let me know what you guys think, or of you think there's a possible solution I'm missing. [~ingo] I know you generally like having the \"fast\" and \"right\" way to evaluate, so...\r\n\r\nh3. fastest way\r\n\r\nWhenever Studio adds BB as a new platform to a project, it adds the \"blackberry\" folder to both \"Resources\" and \"app/assets\". \r\n\r\n*pros:* quick, and requires a change to only one project (Studio)\r\n*cons:* Doesn't account for the CLI\r\n\r\nh3. longer, better way\r\n\r\nAlloy implements a new command for adding new platforms relying on assets contained in alloy itself. So instead of Studio calling \"alloy new\", which is dangerous after initial project creation, Studio would call \"alloy platform add blackberry\", or something like that, which would then populate the \"app/assets/blackberry\" folder.\r\n\r\n*pros:* could be done in studio or CLI\r\n*cons:* now requires change to both Alloy and Studio\r\n\r\nh3. even longer, even better way\r\n\r\nThe CLI exposes a hook for the completion of this very long command (I believe \"project\" is the command name):\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n\"/usr/local/bin/titanium\" \"--no-colors\" \"--no-prompt\" \"--no-banner\" \"project\" \"--sdk\" \"3.1.1.v20130530171546\" \"--project-dir\" \"/Users/mxia/Documents/Titanium_Studio_Workspace/testbb\" \"deployment-targets\" \"blackberry,tizen,mobileweb,android,iphone,iPad\"\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nAlloy modifies its current hook to read this input, and make sure \"app/assets\" folders are supplied for any platform specified if the \"project\" command is adding \"deployment-targets\". \r\n\r\n*pros:* Studio and CLI are covered and there's no manual alloy step for anyone anymore\r\n*cons:* not a quick fix",

					"body": "[~ingo]\n\noption 1: no time from my perspective (all work is in studio's court here)\noption 2: a couple hours (plus Studio's estimate of time)\noption 3: to be comfortable with its stability, about a day since changing the hook potentially impacts every Alloy app (lots of testing). But I couldn't even start it before this hook was added to the CLI, and obviously whatever version of the CLI supports it would be necessary.\n\nThere is however a 4th option which would likely be faster than all the other and would put the work on the BB platform, which makes sense since it is the new kid on the block in this scenario. Can't BB just handle the scenario where it doesn't have the appropriate files in its \"Resources/blackberry\" folder? Again, like option #1, not ideal, but quick and covers this situation.\n\nTo be clear, option #3 is the way to go long term. It just introduces a lot more variables and potential for regression at this late point in the game than does option #1 or #4. ",
