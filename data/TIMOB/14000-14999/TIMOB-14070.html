<h3>Description</h3>

Enterprise customers typically have centralized build systems that are managed by IT. While these may be setup for mobile application development, they may not have Titanium / Titanium SDK installed. Enterprise processes can be extremely intense and make it difficult to get new software added to these environments.

It is necessary for the new CLI/SDK to expose functionality which used to exist in python based SDK to bundle and transport applications for supported platforms as a stand alone instance so they can be successfully built on these centralized environments regardless of whether Titanium CLI/SDK exist on the machine.
