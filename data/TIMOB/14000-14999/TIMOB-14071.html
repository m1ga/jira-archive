<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>problem</h4>

In order for processes outside of the CLI to be able to react to changes made via the "project" command, the CLI needs to expose hooks. In particular, the case in TIMOB-14068 eventually requires that Alloy should be able to execute some code _after_ Studio adds a new platform to an existing project via the "project" command, specifically like:

<code><pre>
"/usr/local/bin/titanium" "--no-colors" "--no-prompt" "--no-banner" "project" "--sdk" "3.1.1.v20130530171546" "--project-dir" "/Users/mxia/Documents/Titanium_Studio_Workspace/testbb" "deployment-targets" "blackberry,tizen,mobileweb,android,iphone,iPad"
</pre></code>

Currently this command runs as expected, but Alloy has no means of knowing when that happens since there's no hook into this process. 

<h4>expected</h4>

The CLI should expose a hook that allows a process to react to the situation where the "titanium project" command updates an existing project.

   The project command isn't quite what I was hoping it to be. It will probably go away or properly fixed. It doesn't matter since we don't need hooks for Alloy's sake since Alloy v2 will be apart of the Titanium build process.</li>
