<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Description:</h4>
While testing the latest SDK and checking all the NPM packages, it was noted by Dustin that the node-appc version installed was 0.1.30 instead of 0.1.30-cr.

I am unsure if the version is identical, but this version should match the npm install versions.

<h4>Steps to reproduce:</h4>
1) Install build 3.1.1.v20130531163723 via your favorite method
2) Navigate to titanium/mobilesdk/osx/3.1.1.v20130531163723/node_modules/node-appc/package.json
3) Check the contents for the version

<h4>Result:</h4>
version is 0.1.30

<h4>Expected Result:</h4>
version is 0.1.30-cr

   Wow, I never thought about that. The SDK isn't delivered as an NPM module, so our typical methods of messing with version numbers can't be used here. The only way I can think of off the top of my head is to commit the "-cr" prefix to the package.json in the repo and update the repo as we release new versions...that's really undesirable of course. Does anyone else have any ideas?</li>

   We discussed and this is currently not really a problem. We'll revisit this as part of 3.2.0</li>

   Right now, the node-appc that is bundled into the SDK is always the latest for a given branch (master, 3_1_X, etc), which coincidentally with the few changes to node-appc is identical to the RC version.
   
   To solve this problem, we need a number of things in place. First we need CI builds for node-appc. Then we need the SDK builder. The SDK CI build will invoke the new SDK builder which will need to identify the correct version of node-appc to bundle.</li>

   This is an old issue and we're moving on!</li>
