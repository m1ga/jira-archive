<h3>Description</h3>

I want to push adhoc builds to testflight with the development environment enabled so I can have testers enter data in development ACS environment. Currently the _build.js has "production" hard coded if you do dist-adhoc. I have fixed by modifying it locally, but seems like it should be a CLI option.

   Changing _build.js to not use the "production" deploy type won't work for push notifications.
   
   Since you have to use a Distribution Certificate to produce Ad-Hoc builds, those builds will use production device tokens which will not get push notifications from the APNs sandbox, even if you try to subscribe those production tokens to the APNs sandbox.</li>
