<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Issue</h4>
Client had to set <supports-screens android:anyDensity="true" /> explicitly in order to load the density-specific resources correctly.

<h4>Steps to reproduce</h4>
1. use demo <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/KitchenSink/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/KitchenSink/</a>
2. Remove from tiapp.xml <supports-screens android:anyDensity="false"/> tag
3. Install & run

<h4>Expected behavior</h4>
The default is true already.

<h4>Actual behavior</h4>
The screen looks scaled (like if anyDensity true wasn't honored).

<h4>Additional details</h4>
They used <tool-api-level>17</tool-api-level> and <uses-sdk  targetSdkVersion="17"/>.

They have to include <supports-screens android:anyDensity="true" /> in order to get correct resources on devices of different resolutions.

<h4>Tested on</h4>
tested on a xhdpi device, android 4.1.2 a S3 as well as new htc one.

If they don't include <supports-screens android:anyDensity="true" />, the app is displayed with mdpi assets. If they include <supports-screens android:anyDensity="true" />, the app is displayed correctly with xhdpi assets.

They use unit "dp" in all places of their code.

Right now this isn't an issue for their app because they can simply include <supports-screens android:anyDensity="true" /> for everything to work.

<h4>Documentation</h4>
The Titanium project was clean up as our docs say:
"You may or may not need to clean your project (force Titanium to freshly re-generate the native project files) to ensure your new configuration settings are picked up"

   This ticket is something to consider when working on the Titanium Asset Management System (TIMOB-19298).</li>
<li>Lee Morris 2017-05-02

   Resolving ticket as Invalid as there is now a new version of Kitchen Sink available and we no longer support the version which relates to this ticket.</li>
