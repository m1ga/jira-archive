   I don't see this.
   
   Appcelerator Studio 3.1.1.201306061938: Mountain Lion 10.8.3, Mountain Lion 10.8.4
   Xcode 4.6.2
   Titanium CLI 3.1.1-cr
   Titanium Alloy 1.1.3-cr
   Titanium SDK 3.1.1.v20130606121419
   iPod 6.1.3
   Classic Project, Alloy Project

   The good: It's not a freeze/hang in the sense of an application becoming unresponsive. Hitting cancel exits the state as expected.
   
   The bad: The iDevice and system still aren't finding each other enough for comfort.
   
   The WTF: So I went and checked with Olga about the situation. We tried the following in sequence:
   
   Cable was plugged in. Had Olga unplug cable. Profile matching worked. (Success)
   Plugged cable in, still having Guests on wifi. Success.
   Turned off wifi. Profile matching failed as expected.
   Turned wifi back on. Profile matching still failed (Expected success)
   
   Since then we can't get the profile matching to work, despite cleaning, restarting AppStud, dancing in a half-circle, etc.
   
   Strange.</li>

   Restarted my computer, changed wifi to Appcelerator - success.
   Plugged cable in, still having Appcelerator on wifi. Success.
   Turned off wifi. Profile matching failed as expected.
   Turned wifi back on. Profile matching -success.
   Changed wifi to Guests, cable in - failed.
   Unplugged cable, wifi Guests - failed.
   Changed wifi to Appcelerator - success.
   Changed wifi to Guests - failed.
   
   A mistery spot...

   Works fine for me using Appcelerator Guest network. 
   Tried also switching machine network back and forth from Appcelerator Guest to Appcelerator Inc.
   When both device and machine were on the same network, it worked as expected.
   
   Environment:
   
   Titanium SDK 3.1.1.v20130611153550
   Appcelerator Studio 3.1.1.201306101955
   Mountain Lion 10.8.3
   Code Processor 1.0.1-cr4
   Alloy 1.1.3-cr
   Node 0.8.22
   
   Device used: iPhone 5 with OS 6.1.4</li>
