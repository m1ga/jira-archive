<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Issue</h4>
The graphic assets that are in the build directory under Resources/iPhone/Images folder need to be moved to resources/images, and then they show up fine.

<h4>How to re-create:</h4>
(1) Get Titanium project attached targeting a 3.0.2 build
(2) Run transport.py 
(3) Open in xcode and try to run in iPhone 5

<h4>Actual results</h4>
You'll see the images missing on the iPhone 5, as well as the appicon.

They are getting put in build/iphone/Resources/iphone/images directory. They have to copy them to the build/iphone/Resources/images directory manually.

They also have to copy the build/iphone/Resources/iphone/appicon@2x.png to the build/iphone/Resources directory manually.
