   The reason it crashes is due to the structure of the app. It is missing a BB example.
   
   In ApplicationWindow.js there is a require statement looking for "ui/ApplicationWindowPlatform.js" This file is inside both the iphone and android directory, but it is missing from the blackberry directory. If the framework does not find the required file in the root of the Resources directory it will try to look for it in the platform specific dir. Since it is missing from the blackberry dir, it fails and crashes.
   
   This template needs to be updated for blackberry.</li>
