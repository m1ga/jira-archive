<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Feature request description</h4>

Code Analyzer is analyzing the Alloy compiled code included into the 'Resources' folder - as a result, we could get errors or warnings relative to Alloy generated portions of code which is not linked to user created original code included in the 'App' folder, but only present in the compiled code in the 'Resources' folder.

This behavior could be confusing from the end user perspective, that could experience 'false' error reports relative to 'Resources' files in the results.

Code Analyzer should sort between user-generated code errors/warnings and Alloy compiler generated.
