   I'm re-opening the issue for more investigation since I still saw it with LiveView 0.1.28 on a sample app.</li>
<li>Federico Casali 2013-07-22

   Confirming bug behavior. I was able to reproduce it with this environment.
   
   Titanium SDK 3.1.2.v20130718094558
   Appcelerator Studio 3.1.2.201307191853
   Alloy 1.2.0
   LiveView 0.1.28 (from Beta stream)</li>
<li>Federico Casali 2013-07-22

   Also, currently not able to run LiveView on Android device.
   Always displaying the exception also after rebuilding. </li>

   Resolved in [master] <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/liveview/commit/512e8e39f0cd5428be9248f96b074a9000318a9e" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/liveview/commit/512e8e39f0cd5428be9248f96b074a9000318a9e</a></li>

   The issue was when the device model is "sdk" the proxy ip 10.0.2.2 is used to connect to the server 127.0.0.1. The problem was for some android emulators the device model outputs as google_sdk</li>

   Closing as fixed since LiveView server runs as expected with :
   OSX: 10.8.5
   Xcode: 5.0
   Appcelerator Studio:3.2.0.201312151544
   SDK:3.2.0.v20131216191854
   alloy: 1.3.0-cr2
   acs: 1.0.10
   npm: 1.3.2
   titanium: 3.2.0-cr3
   titanium-code-processor: 1.1.0-cr2
   Device: Nexus 7 (v4.3)</li>
