		"description": "The UIView class defines the following additions:\r\n\r\n* The tintColor property applies a tint color that affects both the view and its subviews. For information on how to apply tint colors, see iOS 7 UI Transition Guide.\r\n* You can create keyframe-based animations using views. You can also make changes to your views and specifically prevent any animations from being performed.\r\n* The UIViewController class defines the following additions:\r\n* View controller transitions can be customized, driven interactively, or replaced altogether with ones you designate.\r\n* View controllers can now specify their preferred status bar style and visibility. The system uses the provided information to manage the status bar style as new view controllers appear. You can also control how this behavior is applied using the UIViewControllerBasedStatusBarAppearance key in your app’s Info.plist file.\r\n* The UIMotionEffect class defines the basic behavior for motion effects, which are objects that define how a view responds to device-based motion.\r\nCollection views support UIKit Dynamics. Using this support, you can apply behavior objects to layout attributes to animate the corresponding items in the collection.\r\nThe imageNamed: method of UIImage supports retrieving images stored in image asset catalogs, which are a way to manage and optimize assets that have multiple sizes and resolutions. You create image asset catalogs in Xcode.\r\n* There is a new snapshot method on UIView and UIScreen creates a view that you can use to present your app’s content.\r\nThe UIKeyCommand class wraps keyboard events received from an external hardware keyboard. These events are delivered to the app’s responder chain for processing.\r\n* A UIFontDescriptor object describes a font using a dictionary of attributes. Use font descriptors to interoperate with other platforms.\r\n* The UIFont and UIFontDescriptor classes support dynamic text sizing, which improves legibility for text in apps. With this feature, the user controls the desired font size that all apps in the system should use.\r\n* The UIApplicationDelegate protocol adds methods for handling background fetch behaviors.\r\n* UIKit adds support for running in a guided-access mode, which allows an app to lock itself to prevent modification by the user. This app is intended for institutions such as schools where users bring their own devices but need to run apps provided by the institution.\r\n* State restoration now allows the saving and restoration of any object. Objects adopting the UIStateRestoring protocol can write out state information when the app moves to the background and have that state restored during subsequent launches.\r\n* Table views now support estimating the height of rows and other elements, which improves scrolling performance.\r\n\r\nUDID change: http://techcrunch.com/2013/06/14/ios-7-eliminates-mac-address-as-tracking-option-signaling-final-push-towards-apples-own-ad-identifier-technology/\r\n",
