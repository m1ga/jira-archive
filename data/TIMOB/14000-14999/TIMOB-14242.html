<h3>Description</h3>

I was going to upload my app to the Google play store when I saw that x86 native SDK libraries were not included in the APK (libkroll-v8.so, libtiverify.so, libtiprofiler.so, libstlport_shared.so).

I noticed these lines in builder.py (lines from 1696):

{quote}
if abi == 'x86' and ((not os.path.exists(lib_source_dir)) or self.deploy_type == 'production'):
<h4>x86 only in non-production builds for now.</h4>
continue
{quote}

and removing them did the trick. It is normal behaviour not to including that libraries in production releases or it is a mistake? And if it is normal what is the reason?

Way to reproduce:
- Use the feature "Distribute - Android App Store"
- Open the created APK with some zip reader
- Navigate in lib/x86
- No native libraries included

   Same issue for us !
   It's really annoying since a part of our audience can't open our app.
   
   Why have you implemented this condition removing x86 from production app (and not test) ? Is it safe to comment these lines ?
   
   Thanks in advance for your answer</li>
