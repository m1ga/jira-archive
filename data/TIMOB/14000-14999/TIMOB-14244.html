<h3>Description</h3>

In my app I implemented user ability to change toolbars color via 3 sliders. In iOS6, everything is fine(simulator, device). I installed iOS7 beta1 yesterday and this function is not working(on device, I didn't installed new Xcode and simulator).

   Hello Marian,
   
   As iOS7 has just been released, we do not support it yet. It will take sometime before all functionality is developed for the new iOS7 in our SDK. It is to be expected that iOS7 components will not be fully functional at this point. We will be accepting iOS7 related tickets (bugs and new features) once the update which supports it goes live.
   
   Regards,
   Carter</li>

   Hello Carter,
   thank you for your response, I didn't want from you to solve this, I wanted to report it only(for other developers with same functionality/problem).
   Thanks</li>

   Marian, 
   
   Ok, I understand that, I put the ticket on hold so that if the issue does arise when we go live with iOS7 support I can just reopen the ticket. Thanks for bringing this to our attention.
   
   Regards,

   Marian--Can you add a test case that demonstrates your issue?</li>
<li>Marian Kucharcik 2013-06-13

   Sure, but how can I do that?
   I can send you my code by email if you want...</li>

   Marian--We're just looking for a simple snippet of code that replicates the issue.</li>
<li>Carter Lathrop 2013-06-14

   Hello Marian, 
   
   If possible, within the description of the ticket here, paste a test case, no more than 50 lines, which shows the toolbar color change not working. It should be able to be simply copied and pasted into an app.js and when run, show the problem clearly. If any more instructions are needed, provided a list of steps titled "steps to reproduce". Also, to format the code within the description box, encapsulate the code with {.code.} tags at the beginning and end. (remove the dots first)
   
   Thanks,
   Carter</li>

   I can confirm the issue. All you need is a window with a different bar color.
   
   <code><pre>
   var win1 = Titanium.UI.createWindow();
   
   var win2 = Titanium.UI.createWindow({
       barColor:'#00f',
       backgroundColor: 'red',
       title: 'Red Window'
   });
   
   var nav = Titanium.UI.iPhone.createNavigationGroup({
      window: win2
   });
   
   win1.add(nav);
   win1.open();
   </pre></code></li>

   Should be resolved in 3.1.3 C.I build. Please retest you code.
