<h3>Description</h3>

On Android market I'm getting infrequent Google Play store crash reports:

<code><pre>java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: Library kroll-v8 not found
at java.lang.Runtime.loadLibrary(Runtime.java:461)
at java.lang.System.loadLibrary(System.java:557)

at org.appcelerator.kroll.KrollRuntime$KrollRuntimeThread.run(KrollRuntime.java:106)</pre></code>

I've received a bad review based on this error. I know the apk is good as I'm getting lots of feedback from people who are not experiencing this problem.

Here is another titanium developer having this error:

   I've contacted a user who has experienced this crash and asked them to re-download a newer version of the application as I was curious if it was an installation glitch or something. 
   
   They are still getting the same problem. I've had x8 crash reports about this in the past 48 hours.
   
   Please could a Ti dev respond?</li>

   The user that I'm talking to who is experiencing this crash is using an Xperia Arc S : Sony Ericsson LT18i (LT18i). Apparently when he opens the app it immediately closes.

   Hi Jimmy,
   We need more information. What TiSDK are you using? Are you using any modules?
   Would it be possible to provide us with the app name so that we can test this ourselves?
   Cheers.</li>

   Hi Daniel, here I compile list of devices that affected by this bug, hope it helps
    * ALCATEL_one_touch_990, android 2.2.2
    * ALCATEL_one_touch_990A, android 2.2.2
    * Alcatel_one_touch_908F_Orange, android 2.2.2
    * ALCATEL_one_touch_908A, android 2.2.2
    * ALCATEL_one_touch_908, android 2.2.2

   There are other models named 'MOVE' and 'Los Angeles', but I couldn't find any info about these phones. As you can see the bug affect several Alcatel devices with android 2.2.2.
   I'd like to also answer your question to Jimmy, TiSDK - 2.1.3.GA, modules: ti.admob, appid: com.mobile9.market.ggs</li>

   Please upload the apk of the app that crashes so that we can take a more detail look into this.</li>
<li>Arnaud Besnier 2013-06-14

   We have got the same issue here.
   
   Is it possible that there is an issue on using the V8 with some specific architectures (for example, Intel x86)?</li>
<li>Daniel Sefton 2013-06-14

    Hi Arnaud,
    
    Which SDK version is your app using?</li>
<li>Arnaud Besnier 2013-06-17

    Our app was built using the SDK 3.1.0.</li>
<li>Arnaud Besnier 2013-06-18

    It may be an Android issue.

<li>Hieu Pham 2014-01-24

    I unzip an apk built using our CLI, and libkroll-v8.so is present in all armeabi/armebi-v7a/x86. This is an Android issue, closing as 'not our bug'</li>
