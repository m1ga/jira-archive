<h3>Description</h3>

Using Appcelerator Studio it is not able to install an application into android simulator as well as into android device. But iOS simulator works fine. Also older versions of Titanium Studio works fine with these projects

Android SDK and NDK are already uptodate and works fine on Titanium Studio

   Could you try the following?
   
   1. Open Preferences > Studio > Troubleshooting page;
   2. Change "Debug Level" to All and make the entry "com.aptana.core/debug/shell" checked;
   3. Restart Studio and install on Android emulator or device again;
   4. Open Help > Studio > View Log File and find the titanium build command toward the end of the file;
   5. Run the same command from the command line to see if it produces the same error.
   
   Another thing to make sure is to open Run > Run Configurations dialog, select the Android emulator launch configuration for the project, and check if "Enable LiveView" is selected.
   
   Thanks.
