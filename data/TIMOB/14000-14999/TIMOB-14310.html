<h3>Description</h3>

Partners and customers should be able to add to our code analysis engines.  Either the Dynamic Code Analyzer or our static code analysis.  One or both of these engines should be extensible.  We will never be able to provide all the functionality that customers want:
Ex. Security checks, performance analysis, code formatting, depth level of call stacks, etc...

So we should allow 3rd parties or customers to add to the rules engine.  This will provide added value to the platform, plus add our open and extensible claims

   Code processor is dead. In the new Titanium build pipeline we will expose the AST to hooks so they can perform some static analysis, but that's about as far as we'll go.</li>

   Closing ticket as Code processor is no longer supported.</li>
