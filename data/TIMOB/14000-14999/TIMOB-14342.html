<h3>Description</h3>

Most apps will want to incorporate iOS' standard Navigation Bar in their apps.

One of two ways to include the Navigation Bar is by using a NavigationGroup to wrap your windows. Opening (or closing) a new window either uses the default left-right sliding animation, or no animation at all.

I know that the underlying, native UINavigationController works identically in this regard. Interestingly, in native land people seem to be having found ways to use custom animations for window transitions nonetheless. I would very much like to have this flexibility in Titanium as well.

My Cocoa/ObjectiveC knowledge is lacking, so I don't know how solid these workarounds are, but below is a list of some of the results that came up while searching the web:

* <a href="https://gist.github.com/nvln/1831040" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://gist.github.com/nvln/1831040</a>

These constructions all either seem to use mechanisms that are not supported, or properties that are not exposed via Titanium.

Perhaps there is more optimal way of introducing custom transitions, I leave that to you. My questions is: Would it be possible for you to implement a way for us developers to get custom transitions into our apps, while still using the NavigationGroup?

   [~iotashan] Is there a reason you tagged it as iOS 7? We removed it for now, but we can add it back again.</li>
<li>Shannon Hicks 2013-08-20

   Because of the new iOS 7 APIs?
   
   From Apple's Docs:
   
   {quote}In iOS 7, view controllers can support custom animated transitions between views. In addition, you can use iOS 7 APIs to support user interaction during an animated transition. To learn more, see UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning Protocol Reference and UIViewControllerInteractiveTransitioning Protocol Reference.{quote}</li>
