<h3>Description</h3>

Enable Android AVD Keyboard Support when Studio created an AVD

When you create an AVD, by default Keyboard Support is not enabled and this makes it very difficult to enter characters because you cannot use the computer keyboard. Instead you must use the Android on screen keyboard.

You can edit the AVD and add this parameter set to "yes" (see attached screen shot).

It would be nice if we could add this parameter when we create an AVD.

   @Leor - Where could you create an AVD in Titanium Studio? I don't think that's a feature we support.

   If an AVD is not running, when you launch on Android Emulator, if an AVD is not found that matches the run configurations, then we create an AVD. See my AVD list attached. All those that start with 'titanium' were created by us.
   
   I am suggesting that when an AVD is created automatically by us, we pass an argument that sets the keyboard option</li>

   Studio doesn't create the AVD directly; instead, I believe the AVD is created by our Android CLI when the CLI build script is run. Moving to platform to add such a parameter first, and then we could expose it in Studio.

   As Michael mentioned, the CLI just calls the Android tool to create AVDs.  The user can customize it as Android allows, and we don't have control over it.  Resolving this as won't fix.</li>

   Closing ticket as Won't Fix with reference to the above comments.</li>
