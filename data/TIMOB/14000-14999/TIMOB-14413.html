<h3>Description</h3>

Customer has ID cards that they want to display on a smartphone.  By default they want the image to appear in Landscape mode.  But they cannot do that with our MobileWeb solution.
They would like the page that is displaying the image to be shown by default in Landscape.

   Clarification question: are we talking about the orientation of the entire page (i.e. trying to set Ti.Gesture.orientation), or are we talking about the orientation of an image within a page (i.e the image looks rotated but the rest of the app is fine)?</li>

   Orientation of the entire page.  They couldn't get the page to landscape by default.
   Not the entire app, just one particular page.  So all pages are portrait and then you navigate to a certain page and they want that page to default to landscape.</li>

   @Stephen, Mobile Web does not support this. Even if they rotated their entire view using a 2DMatrix, scrolling would probably be a problem. Plus I imagine that the they would run into issues with the size of the viewport changing depending on the location of the url and navigation bar.
   
   In short, it's going to be a lot of work and will probably not work very well.
   
   We should just add proper orientation support to Mobile Web that would take into account device orientation and the orientation the app requests. This is a along the magnitude of a couple days of work and will likely still have parity issues with the other native platforms.</li>

   Ok.  Let's see what we can get done.  If we can't do this, let's do what you are suggesting.</li>
<li>Lee Morris 2017-06-26

   Resolving as "Won't Fix" as MobileWeb has been deprecated.</li>

   Closing as will not fix.</li>
