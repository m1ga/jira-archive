   Clarification question: is the customer referring to the back button shown on a Ti.UI.MobileWeb.NavigationGroup in the upper left corner?</li>
<li>Stephen Feloney 2013-07-09

   Yes.  The upper left corner back button.  That is correct.</li>
<li>Bryan Hughes 2013-07-09

   Do you think that this is something where we should change the default for all of mobile web, or something where we should introduce a new API to allow developers to change it themselves, or something where we should help this specific customer to use a custom build of mobile web?</li>
<li>Ingo Muschenetz 2013-07-09

   Since this is a MobileWeb specific control, it seems that it is fine to expose an API just for MobileWeb to change this value. To confirm--they would like to use an arrow. Is that an image or text?</li>
<li>Bryan Hughes 2013-07-09

   We don't know for certain that it's mobile web specific. If we expose an API, we need to vet it against the other platforms.</li>

   Given the workaround, de-escalating.</li>

   Any news about this bug? Is there a solution to localize back button title?
   
   Thanks</li>

   [~otto.pic] No news. A permanent fix is not on the radar. Patches welcome! :)</li>
<li>Lee Morris 2017-06-29

   Resolving as "Won't Fix" as MobileWeb has been deprecated.</li>
<li>Eric Merriman  2018-04-04

    Closing as will not fix.</li>
