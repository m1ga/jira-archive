<h3>Description</h3>

Textfield hint text miss alignment in iOS 7 Beta 2

Client upgraded there iPad to iOS 7 Beta 2 and noticed that the hint text in their Titanium sample app no longer is correctly aligned.  Screenshot is attached.

When typing text into the fields there is no issue.  The hint text seems to be the only problem.  They just wanted to bring this to our attention.

I know that we are not yet supporting iOS 7 since it is not released but wanted to log this issue.

   [~lbrenman] could you provide us with a small test case, just to rule out that this is not a test case issue.

   Hi Sabil, this came from a client email so we don't have the use case. I don't have an iOS7 environment setup so I cannot create one. Hopefully, we duplicated the issue and can test against the test case we used to duplicate.</li>

   The hint text seems to be left aligned which is default behavior. Seems more like a layout issue to me. Going to resolve this as needs more info. Please attach sample code to reproduce the issue.</li>
