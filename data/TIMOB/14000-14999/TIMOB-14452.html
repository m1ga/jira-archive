<h3>Description</h3>

When starting remote video and zoom it in, rotation of  device won't change video orientation due to native control takeover.
However, pinch to zoom out will fix this issue.
To reproduce:
1. Install and run KS> Phone> Play Movie> remote streaming
2. Rotate device and observe movie orientation change with it
3. Pinch to zoom in and tap on the screen to call native control
4. Rotate device and observe NO change in movie orientation
5. Pinch to zoom out and rotate device to observe NO native control and Yes for change of movie orientation

Actual result:
Rotating device, video is scaled until both dimensions fit the screen exactly, stretching if necessary.
The aspect ratio of the video is not preserved.
