<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Description</h4>
While trying to evaluate the latest Xcode 5 (beta 3) I was unable to install to device. I got the following from the console:

<code><pre>
[INFO] :   Invoking xcodebuild
[TRACE] :  Build settings from command line:
[TRACE] :      CODE_SIGN_ENTITLEMENTS = Entitlements.plist
[TRACE] :      CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY = iPhone Developer: QE Department (C64864TF2L)

[TRACE] :  CodeSign error: code signing is required for product type 'Application' in SDK 'iOS 7.0'
[ERROR] :  Error details: Code Sign error: No codesigning identities found: No codesigning identities (i.e. certificate and private key pairs) that match the provisioning profile specified in your build settings (“Any App Development”) were found.
[ERROR] :  Error details: CodeSign error: code signing is required for product type 'Application' in SDK 'iOS 7.0'
</pre></code>

I tried running the project from within Xcode with a device target with no trouble.
I also tried running on simulator which had no error as well.

<h4>Steps to reproduce</h4>
1) In Studio, set KitchenSink to use 3.1.1.GA SDK
2) Ensure your Xcode-select is set to the beta 3 Xcode (sudo xcode-select -switch <xcode path>) Also ensure Studio is set correctly for the appropriate Xcode in Preferences>Platform>iOS
3) Run on device - select a valid provision which includes the device.

<h4>Result</h4>
Failure as seen above

<h4>Expected</h4>
KitchenSink installed at least to iTunes and run on device after sync.

   Looks like this issue has been resolved in Xcode 5 DP 4 by Apple. No action required on our part.

   This was a Apple Bug in Xcode 5 DP 4</li>
