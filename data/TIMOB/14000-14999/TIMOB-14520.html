<h3>Description</h3>

Steps to reproduce:
Run Anvil -> android/android/android -> jsActivityUrl on Android. It failed with the latest 3.2.0.
This is a regression caused by [this commit](<a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/commit/3ea237cd92cccfe8b2cd822d05c8769dc7b30ca6)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/commit/3ea237cd92cccfe8b2cd822d05c8769dc7b30ca6)</a> .

   The regression is because the "create" event is fired from the main thread (onCreate() method), but the event listener is added from the kroll runtime thread which happens after onCreate()/onStart()/onResume(). So it is too early to check if there is a listener in the hierarchy in the fireEvent()/fireSyncEvent(). The fix is to move the check to doFireEvent() and also set a timeout for firing some sync events so it won't block the UI thread too long (TIMOB-13253).
   For FR: 
   1. run anvil test. Should have 371 passed / 35 failed.
   2. test TIMOB-14984.
   3. test KS.</li>

   [~ingo] Any update on this ticket? It appears that it is a 3.1.2 regression that we should fix in 3.1.3 release.</li>

   [~ngupta] Yes, this is the ticket I referenced in an earlier thread when we were discussing the ti.cloudpush issue (but is evidently not related). The chain is somewhat convoluted, but in short, we have a fix, but the number of people the issue affects is small, but the number of people that the fix could affect adversely if we missed a case is large. We thus decided to defer this fix for 3.2.0 when we had more time to properly test the issue.
   
   [~pwang] We should merge the proper solution (not the PR here, but the updated one you and Vishal arrived at) into 3.2.0.</li>
<li>Ping Wang 2013-09-13

   [~ingo], the proper solution is the PR listed above (I already updated the PR with the solution Vishal and I arrived at).</li>
