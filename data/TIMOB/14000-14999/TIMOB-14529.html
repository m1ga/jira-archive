   Sorry I don't understand. How can you focus a TextField which is out of view?</li>
<li>Matej 2013-07-09

   I don't understand "out of view". In sample above I want to focus TextField which is in the first row of a TableView. Or another example. 
   
   User filled table with 10-20 rows/TextFields and now he is in the bottom of a TableView - on a last row. He pressed SAVE button ,but first/second... TextField is filled wrong ,so I want to set focus for this TextField ,but unfortunately I can't...</li>

   By out of view I mean how can you focus a TextField which you can't see. However, are you referring to the auto scrolling by any chance?
   
   Where if you're focussed on the bottom TextField and try to scroll up it scrolls back down.
   
   It's still possible to enter focus into a top TextField however, you just need to be fast.</li>

   But why I can't focus a TextField which I can't see? That isn't normal behavior or? Basically if is user on the bottom of a TableView and last TextField has focus / doesn't has focus (It is doesn't matter) I can't set focus for first TextField (For example, it may be second, third TextField...). After set focus for first TextField I want to move/scroll TableView to this TextField ,so user can see TextField where he has to put/change data ,but unfortunately I can't...</li>

   My apologies, I totally looked over the fact that it had an interval programatically setting the focus :/
   
   Tested and confirmed on iOS 6 simulator with Ti SDK 3.1.1 GA and latest 3.2 CI.</li>
