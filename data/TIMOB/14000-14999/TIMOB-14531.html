<h3>Description</h3>

Installing an app on a development-enabled device currently uses iTunes syncing, which can be an inconvenience, especially when the user doesn't want to sync their apps (imagine multiple devices on multiple machines).

Apps can also be built and run from the generated Xcode project, but this is time consuming and not fully guaranteed to work.

There are better options out there that can and should be integrated, including:

   I know from TIMOB-8676 that FruitStrap's GPL license is a problem, but CodexLab's <code>mobiledevice</code> is under MIT.
   
   I don't understand why TIMOB-8676 was closed, saying it it superseded by TIMOB-9969, which also has very little activity.
   
   Hate to say it, but.. just get CodexLab's thing in and rock it! :)</li>

   Dupe of TIMOB-5823.
   
   Efforts are already underway to support installing an app directly to device. We have a working prototype, but need to clean it up and properly integrate it so that Studio can support it.</li>
