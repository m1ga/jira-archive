		"description": "h4. Problem Description\r\nOnce you add modules to a project, the deployed app in device will get stuck in the splashscreen trying to contact api.appcelerator.net. This is only happening if you are using modules and you are connected to a non-working wifi (i.e., connected to a wifi router without actual internet connection). \r\n\r\nh4. Steps to reproduce\r\n1. Create a new mobile project (support for iOS)\r\n2. Add any module to the project.\r\n3. build to device. \r\n4. Deploy the app to a device, connected to a wifi router without internet access\r\n5. The app will stuck in the splash screen for 20 or more seconds. \r\n\r\nh4. Extra info\r\n\r\nI have customers with local wifi connection but without internet connection. I need to load few modules inside my app, but in doing so my app would get stuck at splashscreen for 15-16 seconds average (sometimes even longer, depending on the configuration) while trying to contact api.appcelerator.net . The app will get started right after the http call times out.\r\n\r\nConfiguration:\r\n- Analytics is set to false in tiapp.xml\r\n- The app will present this issue no matter what module is included (even modules not downloaded from the market, but compiled from scratch)\r\n- The app won't present this issue if wifi and 3g are turned off.\r\n- The app won't present this issue if I don't include any modules.\r\n- The app won't present this issue if I compile it with TiSDK 2.1.4.GA\r\n\r\n\r\nh4.

					"body": "[~a.marcone] There's a lot of confusion around deploy types and build targets. Currently build targets (simulator, device, dist-adhoc, dist-appstore) dictate the deploy type. The deploy type then dictates several things such as JavaScript minification/encryption, analytics categorization (when analytics is enabled), module verification, whether error messages are displayed, and so on. I'm in the process of trying to decouple this, but it's a very slow process.\n\nIn Titanium 3.X, device builds are pretty much identical to distribution builds except they are signed with a device cert. By running a dist-adhoc or dist-appstore build, it will properly create the build.manifest file in the build/iphone directory that is set up for production builds. You could hack a device build's build.manifest, but I don't recommend it. You should never tinker with the Xcode project from a simulator build because we symlink files and skip a bunch of stuff like copying fonts.\n\nThere currently is no way to set it to production from Xcode. It will probably make sense to introduce that when we work on the \"titanium export\" command that will generate a self-standing (no Titanium required) Xcode project.",
