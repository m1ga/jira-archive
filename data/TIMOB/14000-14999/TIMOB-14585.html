   Hi Fred,
   
   Please can you attach your Studio log file and diagnostic (both found at Studio -> Help).
   
   It will also help to check your Python version. Run this in Terminal:
   
   <code><pre>python --version</pre></code></li>

   Hi Daniel, Thank you very much for your help!
   
   I made ​​a mistake, i've clear the log file :(
   I you attach the files (diagnostic and log) on my ticket.

   Thank you again.

   @Fred, are you still getting the error message described in this ticket? If you can build, I imagine you no longer get the error.</li>
<li>Fred App 2013-07-18

   @Chris , Yes it's the base of the problem. 
   I do a test because I don't advance (If this can help). 
   
   The problem is always the same!  
   I'm not sur that in modified the file "builder.py" is the good solution. Anyway it doesn't work also.
   
   What to do ? Thanks</li>

   I think you have a corrupt Titanium SDK. Try re-installing it:
   
   <code><pre>
   titanium sdk install --force --default
   </pre></code></li>

   Woooooooh ! Thank you very much Chris !
   
   it's good. I'm saved. Thank you </li>

   Now, I have a new error.
   
   If i create a new project all is OK, the app is installed and launched without problems.
   But if I build a old project (before, without problems with titanium SDK 3.0.2) now i have a erreur (I have clean the project):

   Someone have a idéa for this bugg ?
   
   Thank you again.</li>

   The issue was a bad Titanium SDK install.</li>
<li>Chris Barber 2013-07-18

    @Fred, this issue is resolved. Please add yourself to the watch list for TIMOB-13696 for updates to that issue.</li>

<li>Chris Barber 2013-07-19

    @Fred, Python is a whitespace sensitive language. You may have incorrectly tabbed these lines of code from the TIMOB-13696 comments. Double check your work quick and make sure the whitespace is correct.</li>
<li>Fred App 2013-07-19

    @Chris : Thank you , I double cheack the lines, re-written and it's OK. No errors ;) 
    
    But now my app is installed on my device(no errors in log console), she is launching but she frozen on the splash screen. 
    
    So, in "tiapp.xml" i passed the tag <analytics></analytics> "true"  on "false";
    I rebuild my project , no errors again my app is installed and launched, the splash screen is started, disappears, and my app is closed with a message "nameApp is stopped"
    You have a idea ? ( is i create a simple new project , no problems  )
    
    Thank you again.</li>
<li>Chris Barber 2013-07-19

    @Fred, no idea. Create a new ticket for your problem and perhaps someone that has seen this behavior will know how to fix it.</li>
