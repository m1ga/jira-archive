<h3>Description</h3>

When reading in a file that has a mime type of "application/json", the contents are seen as binary and then cannot be parsed correctly.

I created pull request 4465 to fix this issue:  <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/4465" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/4465</a>

   Is there any update on this? I am installing the latest SDK from github and everytime I install, I have to go and fix this file...   
   
   It is a very small change.  Any chance this could get put into 3.2?  Thanks!!</li>

   [~emerriman] I don't have a test case. Turns out the Bryan had fixed this in the Windows Hybrid branch (prior to being merged with master) as well as we had a community PR from [~brentonhouse]. Bryan never had a test case as far as I know.
   
   To test this, you can simply add a json file to your project, use Ti.Filesystem to read in the json file and you can check if the blob is binary and you can also print out its contents.</li>

   <h4>Environment</h4>
   Mac OSX 10.9.3
   Windows 8.1
   Appcelerator Studio, build: 3.3.0.201406111952
   Titanium SDK, build: 3.3.0.v20140613124912
   Titanium CLI, build: 3.3.0-rc
   Alloy: 1.4.0-rc
   Chrome: 35.0.1916.153
   Firefox: 30.0.0
   Safari: 7.0.4
   Internet Explorer: 11.0.9600.17126
   
   <h4>Results</h4>
   Using Firefox, the Mime-Type displayed: application/json
   Using Chrome, the Mime-Type displayed: text/plain; charset=x-user-defined
   Using Safari, the Mime-Type displayed: text/plain; charset=x-user-defined
   Using Internet Explorer, the Mime-Type displayed: application/json
   
   Also tested on other platforms and found the following:
   Android: application/octet-stream
   iOS: application/json
   BlackBerry: Does not display a mime type
   
   <h4>Extra Information</h4>
   All of the above can read the JSON file correctly and will not display any binary data.
   Therefore, closing this ticket.</li>
