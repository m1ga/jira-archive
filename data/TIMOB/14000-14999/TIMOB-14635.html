   Tested on RAZRi XT890 4.0.4 with titanium 2.1.4, the app did not crash and worked as expected.</li>

   Tried 3.1.1GA SDK with Studio 3.1.1 on a Motorola Razr I running 4.0.4.
   
   Not 100% sure which template was referenced, so I used the "Default" template (with two tabs) as well as the "Tabbed Application" template.
   
   Default template - run on device
   Set run configuration to x86 4.1.2 x86 - unable to reproduce
   Set run configuration to x86 4.2.2 x86 - unable to reproduce
   Set run configuration to Google APIs (2.3.3) armeabi  - unable to reproduce
   
   Tabbed application template - run on device
   Set run configuration to x86 4.0.3 x86 - unable to reproduce
   Set run configuration to x86 4.2.2 x86 - unable to reproduce
   Set run configuration to Google APIs (4.0.3) armeabi-v7a  - unable to reproduce
   
   tried packaging and installing the default template
   Built with Google APIs 4.0 armeabi-v7a - unable to reproduce
   Built with Andrid x86 4.0.3 - unable to reproduce
   
   Can we get some more info?

   Thanks [~emerriman]. We couldn't reproduce it either.
   
   I've misread device logs sorry about that. This is not a x86 processor issue. Probably Titanium is "Scheduling application restart" so we've suggested to have a try at latest stable SDK since 2.1.4.GA is a bit old.</li>

   Customer was able to resolve the problem by unchecking all the choices except for usb debugging on the developer options in settings on the phone.</li>
<li>Ingo Muschenetz 2013-08-06

   Resolving as invalid based on customer feedback.</li>
<li>Lee Morris 2017-03-03

   Closing as invalid.</li>
