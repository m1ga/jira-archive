<h3>Description</h3>

I think this comment is rather worrying:

<a href="https://github.com/pokeb/asi-http-request/issues/368#issuecomment-21515820" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/pokeb/asi-http-request/issues/368#issuecomment-21515820</a>

It's probably about 50%-ish maintained.

A couple of people (myself included) have write access to the main repository, and will merge in anything that is "obviously" correct or multiple people have confirmed is okay, but that's about it.

Anyone building new apps using ASIHTTPRequest is probably crazy - I can't think of any good reason to do so.

However it does appear that it will work fine on iOS 7 and for the foreseeable future, so there's no need to panic if someone has an existing app that uses ASIHTTPRequest. I've no apps left that use asihttprequest though.
