<h3>Description</h3>

Window events - color is different for the messages fired by the user than the color of the messages fired automatically.

This is not regression since the issue occurs on 3.1.0 GA as well.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Go to KS> BASE UI>Windows events
2. Fire each event as specified.
3. Observe the color of the messages.

Actual:
The color of the messages change. But the color of the messages related to the events like focus fired etc remains same.

Expected:
The color of messages related to all fired events should be same.
