<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Problem description</h4>
Using a Picker, the app fails to run and an exception is triggered. 

<h4>Steps to reproduce</h4>
Use the sample code attached (which is also available here: <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/alloy/tree/master/test/apps/ui/picker" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/alloy/tree/master/test/apps/ui/picker</a> )

1. Run the App
Result: App runs, splashscreen is displayed, then it crashes.

From the log, I can see this error:
<code><pre>
app/native/assets/alloy/controllers/index.js:26
    $.__views.column1 = Ti.UI.createPickerColumn({
                              ^
TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'createPickerColumn'
    at new Controller (app/native/assets/alloy/controllers/index.js:26:31)
    at Object.createController (app/native/assets/alloy.js:212:12)
    at app.js:3:7
</pre></code>

   It would appear that BB has not yet implemented multiple columns for pickers. The error clearly states that the Titanium API function createPickerColumn() is not defined on the picker itself. 
   
   Is this the expectation? Is this meant to be implemented for 3.1.2? If not, [~bhatfield] is this accounted for in the API docs? If this will not be implemented in 3.1.2, I can write a conditional in the app to only show the single column version on BB.</li>

   Thanks Tony for investigating. This is a BB platform issue. Even if we don't fully implement the picker column because it's not supported in BB native we can stub it out and so app will not crash.  </li>

   Just an FYI.  Current documentation does not list BlackBerry as a supported platform for any of the Picker-related APIs.</li>
<li>Russell McMahon 2013-07-27

   Just to add to Ben's comments our current BB NDK support is 10.0.9 and the picker support in 10.0.9 was minimal just a date time picker, and we do support that but the more common standard picker will only be available when we support 10.1 and above. For now a picker can be built using a table view and a conditional in the Alloy code.</li>

   Placing these items on hold for the moment based on community interest.</li>

   Closing ticket as BlackBerry is no longer supported by us.</li>
