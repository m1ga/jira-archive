   Every Android device handles keyboard differently, please provide test case you followed from TCMS, so we can verify an expected behavior.  
   
   Tested with:
   Appcelerator Studio, build: 3.1.2.201307311816
   Titanium SDK, build: 3.1.2.v20130801190110
   Devices:
   Nexus7(2)
   Nexus4
   Android version 4.3
   KitchenSink version 3.1.1.GA GUID:28a706e9-4130-4acb-bc76-9494255a9279

   Unsure of the test case run for this ticket, but the behavior will change based on device and is outside our control once we are backgrounded. It is possible to set a variety of flags with Ti.UI.Android to control this, but it is not going to react the same across all devices and OS versions. See the properties that start with "SOFT_INPUT..." under Ti.UI.Android.</li>

   As the behaviour will change based on devices. Hence closing it.
