<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Issue</h4>
Only on android, if I create a new project and build this, it's ok, the app is launched and no problems.

With 3.1.1.GA SDK, When I build an old project (build no problems with 3.0.2) my app is installed on my device(no errors in log console), it is launching but it is frozen on the splash screen.

<h4>Additional details</h4>
So, in "tiapp.xml" I passed the tag <analytics></analytics> "true" on "false";
I rebuild my project , no errors again my app is installed and launched, the splash screen is started, disappears, and my app is closed with a message "MyNameApp is stopped".

   Hi Fred,
   
   Please can you provide the exact steps to reproduce? For example:
   
   1) Open Studio
   2) Create new Classic Default Project
   3) Run on Android
   
   Can you attach your Studio diagnostic? (Help -> Studio -> Run Diagnostic Test...)
   
   Finally, what would be useful is if you could use Android's DDMS tool and attach the output. (Since Studio's console logs don't show runtime output.)
   
   1) Type ddms in Spotlight and click the "ddms" result
   2) Make sure the device is attached
   3) Click the device in DDMS, clear the log with the little X icon
   4) Run the app on the device
   5) Copy the output of DDMS into a new text file
   6) Attach that here</li>
<li>Fred App 2013-08-06

   Thank you very much for your reply.
   
   It's OK , i've all, the diagnostic Test and the logs DDMS of my device.
   
   I don't know where attach my files, so, I you give a link (WeTransfer) for download my logs txt.

   Duplicate of TIMOB-14769?
   </li>
<li>Ping Wang 2013-08-07

   [Fred App|~fred], can you provide a reproducible test case?</li>
<li>Fred App 2013-08-08

   @Ping Wang : I don't understand, how do it ? </li>
<li>Daniel Sefton 2013-08-08

   @Fred: Thanks for the logs, now please can you provide the other part I asked for; steps to reproduce, e.g.
   
   1) Open Studio
   2) Create new Classic Default Project
   3) Run on Android (device version, OS version)
   4) Launch app and observe freeze
   
   Please perform those steps to reach the freeze, and then zip up the created project (all contents, even build folder) and attach it here. That will let us know if the problem is to do with the generated project.
   
   Thanks!
   
   @Devs: The only exception in the DDMS logs is:
   <code><pre>stlport_shared: findLibrary returned null; Titanium 3.1.1,2013/06/15 16:10,f7592c1

   Which I'm not sure is related to the freeze, but it could well be. Just going to mention TIMOB-13696 encase.</li>
<li>Fred App 2013-08-09

    Thank you for the link TIMOB-13696.
    I've already doing this modification because at the beginning i had a error after the update : "duplicate entry: lib/armeabi/libstlport_shared.so". 
    So now it's ok with this but in a second time i have this problem of this ticket.
    
    I you send my projet. You can download my project on this link (we transfert) : 
    <a href="http://we.tl/ndH7siDC1R" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://we.tl/ndH7siDC1R</a>
    
    My device is a SamSung Galaxy S3 GT-I9300 - Version android : 4.0.4 (But with the emulator i have the same error).
    
    Thank you again.</li>

    Hi Fred,
    
        I tried your project and it works fine on latest 3.1.2 CI build. You said if you switch to 3.1.1GA build, it works fine for you. If that's the case, I think you either have a corrupted build, or your environment isn't updated or could be in a weird state. Could you give us more info? I.e: version of Titanium Studio, Android SDK, Android NDK, CLI.</li>
<li>Fred App 2013-08-13

    No, i have the problems of compilation of my apps android since the update 3.1.0 . Before, with the version 3.0.2 no problems. (With the old versions either. No problems). I think that if i update in 3.1.2, it will not solve my problem.
    
    My version Titanium : Titanium Studio, build: 3.1.1.201306112235
    My version SDK Android : Google API android 2.3.3
    CLI version 3.1.1, Titanium SDK version 3.1.1.G
    (How to know the NDK version ?)
    
    Thank you</li>
<li>Fred App 2013-08-21

    Nobody for help me ? :(
    
    Please ! </li>
<li>Fred App 2013-08-22

    I have updated my titanium studio in 3.1.2 GA.
    
    It's OK !!!! No problems  
    
    Thank you .</li>
