<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Problem description</h4>

After building a BlackBerry project, all project files timestamps are updated to the build time.

No other changes seem to take place. 

<h4>Steps to reproduce</h4>
1. Create a project and make a copy.

2. Build the project for BlackBerry (either from CLI or from Appcelerator Studio). Perform a diff between the 2 projects files (for example all files in the 'app' folders for Alloy projects).
Result: no differences are reported.

3. Perform an md5 and compare the checksum of a project file and his copy.
Result: md5 checksum are identical.

4. Check timestamps of the built project files.
Result: files are reporting all timestamps are being modified (Created, Modified and Last Opened).

5. Build for Android
Result: no modification is made to project files timestamps.

<h4>Note</h4>
Issue is reproducible also with CLI and TiSDK 3.1.1 GA.
Not a regression.


<h4>Appcelerator Studio behavior</h4>
Using Appcelerator Studio, I've experienced a inconsistent behavior.
If there are opened project files, the user is usually being being prompted with a message reporting that the file has been modified and should be reloaded (there are no content code differences).
However this behavior seems to be inconsistent or intermittent and it happened that no popup message has been displayed.
