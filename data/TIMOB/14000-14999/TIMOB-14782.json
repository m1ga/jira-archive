		"description": "On the iOS platform, a developer can not set the Accept-Encoding header as one would expect. It is always defaulting to Accept-Encoding=gzip.\r\n\r\nWe are forcing the Accept-Encoding=gzip on our side because of this line:\r\n\r\n[request setAllowCompressedResponse:YES];  (TiNetworkHTTPClientProxy.m line 596)\r\n\r\nBasically, the ASIHTTPRequest that we are using defaults to overriding the Accept-Encoding to gzip if this flag above is YES (which is the default). In our TiNetworkHttpClientProxy, we are also specifically setting this flag to YES in the send function without checking to see if the user has overridden the Accept-Encoding header. So in this case that means that we can not override the Accept-Encoding header at all, and it will always default to gzip value.\r\n\r\nThe fix i propose is pretty easy â€“ we just need to allow the user to set an allowCompressedResponse property on the request object, and then check to see what it is when we are going through the send function and set it accordingly.\r\n\r\nHere is my replacement code:\r\n\r\n if([TiUtils boolValue:[self valueForUndefinedKey:@\"cache\"] def:YES]){\r\n     [request setAllowCompressedResponse:YES];\r\n }\r\n else{\r\n     [request setAllowCompressedResponse:NO];\r\n }\r\n\r\nThis is pretty quick and dirty and end the end, you would need to set this flag to false on the XHR in order to allow the Accept-Encoding header to be set, so there may certainly be a more elegant way for this to work.",

This is perfectly valid.\n\nThis is not a bug, but instead a feature to override West_Interactive's server fault. Their server response was to claim Content-Encoding: gzip for an uncompressed JSON.\n\nMoving to mark this a new feature, but I'm not sure of why we would intentionally disable gzip compression except to compensate for buggy servers.",
