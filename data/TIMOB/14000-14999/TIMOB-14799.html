<h3>Description</h3>

*Problem*
On iOS textfields are cleared by default after some password field had the focus. Is this something that could be prevented. I looked at the docs for textfields, but either I cannot find it or it just isn't there.

*Example code to reproduce*
<code><pre>
var win = Ti.UI.createWindow({
	backgroundColor : 'white'
});

var tf1 = Ti.UI.createTextField({
	value : "textfield1",
	passwordMask : true,
	top : 10,
	width : 200
});
win.add(tf1);

var tf2 = Ti.UI.createTextField({
	value : "textfield2",
	top : 80,
	width: 200
});
win.add(tf2);

win.open();
</pre></code>

*Steps to reproduce*
1. click in the password field
2. click in the "normal" textfield
3. press backspace

*Expected result*
The last character of the textfield is deleted

*Actual result*
The entire contents of the textfield is now cleared instead of only the last character.

   [~shameerj] and [~sunila]. We should test this in 3.2.0 and 3.4.0 (latest master).
   
   * If it cannot be reproduced in 3.2.0, then mark as Can't Reproduce, with no fix version
   * If it can be reproduced in 3.2.0 but not in 3.4.0, mark as Fixed in 3.4.0
   
   Reopening.</li>

   I see no justification this should have ben re-resolved. See my comments above, follow those instructions, and then report your updated findings.</li>

   [~ingo] [~cng]: Checked the issue and created a native project to see the native behaviour and it's the same. Can close this as "Won't fix".</li>
<li>Hans Knöchel 2015-09-01

   The issue is a native iOS-behaviour and no Ti-related bug. Closing</li>
<li>Lee Morris 2017-03-22

   Closing ticket as "Won't Fix".</li>
