<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Problem description</h4>
LiveView changes are applied to all running devices/platforms. However the latest compiled code is applied, potentially generating wrong and unexpected behaviors.

When building an Alloy project on iOS simulator, for example, also the Android emulator is being updated by LiveView (and vice versa).

In this case, the compiled code being used is the one optimized for iOS, so likely generating unexpected behaviors on the Android emulator (for example, platform conditionals being applied are the one relative to the iOS platform, not Android).

<h4>Steps to reproduce</h4>
1. Grab the sample project code attached
2. Build for Android emulator
Result: App runs, Windows has 'blue' backgroundColor
3. Build for iOS simulator
Result: iOS app runs and has 'gray' backgroundColor. However also the Android app on the emulator is being modified, now displaying the 'gray' backgroundColor too.
This is not expected as the backgroundColor is defined into platform specific folders.

   Given ALOY-760 is resolved for Alloy 1.2.1 (Release 3.1.3), we should try to go ahead and address the issue of updating simulators/devices from multiple platforms together for LiveView in 3.1.3.

   [~csullivan] Look like the PR got closed but not merged. Should we have another PR to get it merged into 3.2.1?

   Re-opening since the PR was not merged.

   This in fact works as desired in 3.2.1 release.

   The current (fixed) behavior should be that it rebuilds an iOS version for iOS, and an Android version for Android, and properly displays the right version on the right device.</li>
