<h3>Description</h3>

This is not a regression. 

When trying to finish typing an ID number by clicking "done" on the keyboard, the text field does not save the number. 

Steps to Reproduce:

1. KitchenSink: Phone: Contacts: Search by ID.
2. Enter any number in 'RecordID Number', then press the key "done" on the keyboard instead button 'Find Record by ID'.

Note: We can type the number and press the button 'Find Record by ID', and search will be complete.

Actual Result:

Clear text field.

Expected Result:

Number should stay in the text field, so "Find Record by ID" could be pressed. (like with iOS)

   In Android, button doesn't take focus in touch mode and the code tf1.blur in 'return' handler will set the focus to the next focusable control which is the same textfield itself. Since 'clearOnEdit' is set to true, this clear the text.
   I think the right implementation should be to execute the same search code that is executed when button is clicked in the 'return' handler also.</li>
