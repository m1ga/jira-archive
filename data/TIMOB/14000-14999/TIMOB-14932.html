<h3>Description</h3>

Code analyzer should recommend platform specific enhancements

Would be nice enhancement for Code Analyzer to help folks know of key features that the developer did not leverage in their app. For example, when you run Code Analyzer and select Android it would be nice to flag that the Menu and Heavyweight window is not being utilized.

Today, on a prospect call, a developer asked if we "handle" Android menu automatically because this developer is an iOS developer and wouldn't necessarily know that Android and BB have a menu feature so how would they know that they need to deal with it.

My thought is that some of our best practice and device knowledge can be exposed to the developer when they run a code analysis.

I hope this makes sense.

   Actually should this be a 360 ticket? Isn't it a TIMOB one?</li>
<li>Leor Brenman 2013-08-07

   Gabe, I guess it is timob if that is where code analyzer feature requests should go </li>
