<h3>Description</h3>

We close a SubWindow which was previously opened from a window of a Tabgroup. The title of the tabgroup-window then flashes (disappears and comes visible again). The problem occurs on both title and titleControl. Please check the attached example-file for more details.

   Marking as duplicate of TIMB-14999. Generally, we would close the later ticket as a duplicate. Since the other ticket is linked as the pull request, and contains our QE comments, and is closed as fixed, we will mark this ticket as a duplicate of that ticket.</li>

   Not fixed with the duplicate-fix! Screen-flickers and Window-Title flickering is not the same. Please be careful when marking as duplicate, this is still a very annoying bug</li>

   We cant see any flashing. What we are seeing is the normal transition animations between the navigation items.</li>
<li>Hans Knöchel 2013-09-18

   Can close here! It was a problem with the barImage which was is removed and flash is, too.</li>
