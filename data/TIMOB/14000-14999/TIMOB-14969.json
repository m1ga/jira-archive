		"description": "Some new functionality added to notifications:\r\n\r\nhttp://developer.android.com/about/versions/jelly-bean.html?43\r\n\r\n\"Access to notifications\r\n\r\nNotifications have long been a popular Android feature because they let users see information and updates from across the system, all in one place. Now in Android 4.3, apps can observe the stream of notifications with the user's permission and display the notifications in any way they want, including sending them to nearby devices connected over Bluetooth.\r\n\r\nYou can access notifications through new APIs that let you register a notification listener service and with permission of the user, receive notifications as they are displayed in the status bar. Notifications are delivered to you in full, with all details on the originating app, the post time, the content view and style, and priority. You can evaluate fields of interest in the notifications, process or add context from your app, and route them for display in any way you choose.\r\n\r\nThe new API gives you callbacks when a notification is added, updated, and removed (either because the user dismissed it or the originating app withdrew it). You'll be able to launch any intents attached to the notification or its actions, as well as dismiss it from the system, allowing your app to provide a complete user interface to notifications.\r\n\r\nUsers remain in control of which apps can receive notifications. At any time, they can look in Settings to see which apps have notification access and enable or disable access as needed. Notification access is disabled by default â€” apps can use a new Intent to take the user directly to the Settings to enable the listener service after installation.\"",
