<h3>Description</h3>

Currently, we just looking into all the folders like tools, platform-tools, and build-tools for executables like dx.  The problem is that Google may change this directory structure during different releases, and we need to patch our tools accordingly each time.

We need to find a way to mitigate this such that we don't need to change out build tools when Android changes their directory structure.

   Titanium CLI 3.2 will allow the ability to specify paths every external executable dependency via the CLI's config. If something changes, we can have a workaround until it's fixed in the code.</li>
