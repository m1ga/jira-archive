   Do we have any updates regarding this issue? 
   
   We are facing same issue in our production version. Please give us some solution/work-around for this problem.</li>
<li>ankur garha 2013-08-08

   Guys, 
   
   Can you just have a look at this issue. Our app is already in production version and we are loosing our customers due to this bug.
   </li>
<li>Daniel Sefton 2013-08-30

   Apologies for the delay. Tested and confirmed with Android 4.1.2 x86 QVGA emulator with Ti SDK 3.1.1 GA and 3.2 CI.</li>
<li>Ygor Lemos 2013-09-04

   Also tested on a Samsung Galaxy S4 running Android 4.2.2 (latest). The checkmarks are displayed very very tiny (almost invisible).</li>
<li>Dominic Maricic 2013-09-11

   Any updates? This is a huge issue for our app as we have a ton of Samsung Galaxy S4 users and the check is microscopic! People are thinking it's not even there rendering the app useless.</li>
<li>Abdul Mohammed 2013-09-11

   Facing the same problem hasCheck and hasDetails icon on S4. Too tiny to view. Is there any workaround until this gets resolved?
   
   </li>
<li>Ygor Lemos 2013-09-11

   @Abdul:
   
   For now I have used setRightImage on the tableView and controlled the state using a variable attached to the row. Works like a charm. Had to deal with Android resources for resolution aware directories and multiple images for it to work properly on multiple devices.</li>
<li>ankur garha 2013-09-12

   Hi Ygor, 
   
   But we also want to toggle the hasCheck property and checkbox icon on click of the same row. 
   
   Can you please paste some code snippet for the same which wont effect the app performance as we are using table view with huge number of rows (around 40-50)?
   
   Thanks in advance.

   Has anybody fixed this issue yet?
   
   It has been month now..

    [~speedyankur@gmail.com] It will first be slotted into a release, and then you will see it moved into a "In Progress" state and then finally "Resolved". We have other pressing issues at the moment, so we can't yet fix it. You are welcome to try fixing it and submitting a pull request. We will attempt to address it ASAP.</li>

    I'm really surprised this bug doesn't have a higher priority. Every week it's affecting more and more phones, and therefore users. So far the 2 hottest phones, the Note 3 and the Galaxy S4 are affected as well as many others (even non Samsung, like the latest LG phones). We're up to 25% of our users that can't use our app properly because of this. Is anyone actually looking into this? It's been several months.</li>
<li>ankur garha 2013-10-24

    Hi Ingo,
    
    Please assign this issue to me, so that I can fix this issue.

<li>Ingo Muschenetz 2013-10-24

    [~speedyankur@gmail.com] If you'd like to try fixing the issue, please file a pull request with your fixes and we'd be happy to take a look.</li>

    Hi,
    
    I've the same problem, hasCheck property of TableViewRow is not showing the checkmark icon on right side of the row.
    
    I reproduce on "Xperia Z" with screen 5" and 1920 x 1080 pixels.
     
    Titanium studio 3.2.2 GA
    Titanium sdk 3.2.1
    Cli : 3.2.0
    Android device : Xperia Z [Full HD 1920 x 1080 pixels]
    Andoid : 4.2.2</li>
<li>Dominic Maricic 2014-04-03

    Same here on my Note 3 and other customers are complaining again too. It looks like the problem returned in 3.2.2 as it was fixed previously.</li>
<li>Ingo Muschenetz 2014-04-03

    Hi All, it could NOT have returned in 3.2.2. We made no Android changes in that release. It COULD have returned in 3.2.1. [~douardst] reported it against 3.2.1. Can anyone else confirm?</li>
<li>Dominic Maricic 2014-04-08

    I was able to confirm that the problem existed in 3.2.1.</li>
<li>BABLY DAS 2014-06-21

    This issue is still present with 3.2.3 . Not sure why this issue is being closed?</li>
<li>Ingo Muschenetz 2014-06-21

    [~Bably Das] Please provide a test case and a screenshot that shows the error in 3.2.3 so we can investigate.</li>
<li>Dominic Maricic 2014-06-21

    Who knows? It's been an issue for a year now and cost us quite a few users. We ended up changing the color of the text in the entire row when selected as a workaround. Obviously something as basic as a working checkmark isn't a high priority!!</li>
<li>Dominic Maricic 2014-06-21

    The same text case Ankur posted almost a year ago, still doesn't work! Feel free to use that one rather than make Ingo make a new one.</li>
<li>Dominic Maricic 2014-06-21

    Sorry, I meant rather than make Bably make a nw one.</li>
<li>Ingo Muschenetz 2014-06-21

    Please note that we did find and fix an issue, so we have been active about addressing this. We have had similar device-specific issues with photos. Can someone give me one or more devices that it still happens on for them?</li>
<li>Dominic Maricic 2014-06-21

    It's still occurring on my Samsung Note 3.</li>
<li>Tim Poulsen 2014-09-16

    Possibly related: On higher resolution devices, the check mark icon is tiny. On my Galaxy S5, it's microscopic. I've opened TIMOB-17702.</li>
