   Note that this issue relates to viewing pdfs and Word docs inside the webview.</li>

   Unfortunately, we can't do anything about this. Titanium Mobile Web uses iframes as WebViews. On iOS Mobile Safari (and possibly other mobile browsers) iframes are NOT resizable. The content is rendered 1-to-1.
   
   We have to clamp it with a <div> with overflow=auto to restrict the WebView to a specific size. This also solves the problem of scrolling around the WebView.
   
   Because the content is 1:1, Mobile Safari does not let you resize it.
   
   Turns out we can apply a scale transform to the iframe and that will resize it, but then we'd need to tie it to a pinch gesture. Unfortunately, the touch events needed for the pinch gesture are intercepted by the iframe. The parent window (the Titanium Mobile Web app) never gets the events and so we can't mimic the pinch zoom.
   
   As a workaround, you could create zoom in/out buttons and have them apply a scale transform to your WebView's inner iframe, but that would be Mobile Web specific and extremely hacky.
   
   Another option would be to open the URL in a new window. Unfortunately, Ti.Platform.openURL() uses a WebView, so you'd have to call the browser's built-in window.open(). Again, this is Mobile Web specific and should be wrapped in a if-block.</li>
