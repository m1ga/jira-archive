<h3>Description</h3>

Description:
While testing Kitchen sink, I encountered a difference in searchbar layout and behavior compare to iOS6. 

Steps to reproduce:
<h4>Install KS </h4>
<h4>Launch KS > Base UI > Views > Table Views > Headers with Filter. Index causes unexpected layout.</h4>
<h4>Perform search and see the difference in layout (screenshot "after search.png").</h4>

   With the index being chopped off, the SearchView is added to the TableView so this may not be able to be fixed. With the SearchView resizing, that is still being looked at.</li>

   Same basic issue. Different symptoms</li>
<li>James K 2014-01-19

   This issue is not constrained to use of a search bar and has not been resolved.
   
   Using the example above, delete the search bar and add a background colour to the table view.
   
   On iOS7, the index will display with a white background colour, as it does in the third screenshot above.
   
   It looks pretty horrendous, and it means that you can't use an index if you have a custom table view.</li>

   Same issue here. With the index filter the searchBar is cut on it's right edge by the filter. Please do fix that.
   SDK 5.2.0 GA
   iOS 9</li>
