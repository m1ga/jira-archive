   My observations are as follows:
   <h4>KS build with Xcode5DP6, with sdk 3.1.3.v20130904134612 on iphone4(IOS7):</h4>
   1.Tapping on the google search bar first time shows the cursor at the right of the search bar & typing does not show us the letters being typed.
   2.Tapping on the search bar second bar shows us the cursor on the left of the search bar & typing shows us the letters being typed.
   
   <h4>KS build with Xcode4.6.3, with sdk 3.1.3.v20130904134612 on iphone4(IOS6.0.1):</h4>
   1.Tapping on the google search bar & shows us the letters being typed. 
   
   <h4>KS build with Xcode5DP6, with sdk 3.1.2.GA on iphone4(IOS7):</h4>
   1.Tapping on the google search bar first time shows the cursor at the right of the search bar & typing does not show us the letters being typed.
   2.Tapping on the search bar second bar shows us the cursor on the left of the search bar & typing shows us the letters being typed.

   Its a typo, its tapping on the same search bar second time.</li>

   Since this a webview, only thing we do is load the webview, manage the back and forth stack and reload it. All other interactions within the webview itself is not in our control, at least in this case its a straight out google webpage and where the cursor appears on the webpage is completely up to the internal system and webpage itself.</li>

   Closing this ticket as the issue is not our bug.</li>
