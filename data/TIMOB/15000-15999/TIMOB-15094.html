<h3>Description</h3>

Like discussed in TIMOB-7360 (SDK 1.8.x) Android natively doesn't really support <code>pause</code>/<code>resume</code> events for the app as a whole, but only for separate activities within the app.

However, since both closing the current heavyweight window and closing the app fire the exact same <code>pause</code> event on that window, there is no way to workaround, making this a critical issue!

Having talked about this with several developers and trying multiple workarounds without much success, [~rborn] remembered [~iamyellow] actually did got this working in a [fork of the 2.1.x Titanium SDK](<a href="https://github.com/iamyellow/titanium_mobile/commits/2_1_X_iamyellow)." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/iamyellow/titanium_mobile/commits/2_1_X_iamyellow).</a>

I have cloned the current branch and it seems the 2 commits involved should still work. I can't get the SDK to build on my system (never been there) to verify, but since this is such an frustrating parity problem I kindly ask to have a look at the 2 commits and consider pulling them into the SDK.

I know [~iamyellow] would be happy to be of help.

   The only downside that I see to this would be if someone were to ever build a Titanium App which has a Android Widget activity. I wouldn't want pause/resume to impact both the main activity (the app) and the widget activity together.
   
   Currently, the only way to do an Android Widget with Titanium is via a module and the AndroidManifest.xml file.

   Never heard anyone doing an Android Widget in Titanium and I'm sure we can add a check for that?</li>

   You've never heard of it because I'm working on that module right now.

   Any progress on this? I know it's a hack and that Android natively doesn't really support watching if an app (task) goes to the background and foreground, but this really would be useful in lots of cases, like:
   
   * Updating content when a user returns to the app
   * Pausing app-wide (multiple activities, so <code>allowBackground</code> must be <code>true</code>) music
   * ..</li>

   This would be really useful for my needs. I need to do a particular check every time the app resumes, works a treat on iOS. It seems a shame for me to have to add an event to every single window on the off chance that it might be the one that was last active when I need to perform something on a global scope.</li>
