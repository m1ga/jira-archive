		"description": "Like discussed in TIMOB-7360 (SDK 1.8.x) Android natively doesn't really support {{pause}}/{{resume}} events for the app as a whole, but only for separate activities within the app.\r\n\r\nHowever, since both closing the current heavyweight window and closing the app fire the exact same {{pause}} event on that window, there is no way to workaround, making this a critical issue!\r\n\r\nHaving talked about this with several developers and trying multiple workarounds without much success, [~rborn] remembered [~iamyellow] actually did got this working in a [fork of the 2.1.x Titanium SDK|https://github.com/iamyellow/titanium_mobile/commits/2_1_X_iamyellow].\r\n\r\nI have cloned the current branch and it seems the 2 commits involved should still work. I can't get the SDK to build on my system (never been there) to verify, but since this is such an frustrating parity problem I kindly ask to have a look at the 2 commits and consider pulling them into the SDK.\r\n\r\nI know [~iamyellow] would be happy to be of help.\r\n\r\n* Main commit: https://github.com/iamyellow/titanium_mobile/commit/42ccc574cd2a285b68aebfa4a4bb88fd9b8becce\r\n* Commit to fix triggering the events for {{TiLaunchActivity}}'s: https://github.com/iamyellow/titanium_mobile/commit/73ed97415bf9a12ca1d1849eba4c889f6b51f4ba",
