<h3>Description</h3>

Using the standard methods for taking a photo or video, the camera does not provide means to toggle the front or back camera or the flash. 

It's possible this could be native to the picker now. I don't know. 


To reproduce, use the KitchenSink camera examples. 


It would be good to have the ability in the Titanium SDK to use the AVFoundation / AVCaptureConnection methods. That way, developers could have absolute total control over all available camera features and never have to worry about the differences when using an overlay or not.

   If I understand correctly, the desire here is to have more finite control over the camera features especially in cases where a custom overlay is used. Our current implementation offers "showControls" which when true displays the native controls with flash control (if available), Camera choice (front/back) and a shutter control. If you set showControls false (as you would with a custom overlay), then you get no control over these items. 
   
   Should we change the ticket type to a feature?</li>

   We're going to pursue the module fix instead.</li>

   Closing ticket as the issue will not fix and with reference to the above comments. </li>
