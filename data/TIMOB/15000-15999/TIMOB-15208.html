<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Issue description</h4>
In Titanium SDK 3.1.3 or 3.2.0 customer is seeing an issue in a app where the TiUITabGroup is used.

All the windows that are added to the TabGroup gets invoked as soon as the app launches. 

<h4>Expected result</h4>
Expected scenario is only the first window in the TabGroup is expected to get called.

<h4>Actual result</h4>
The issue is in the latest SDK (3.1.3 or 3.2.0) and it works fine till any SDK version 3.1.2 GA or below to it.

<h4>Attached the sample app to debug.</h4>

<h4>Steps to reproduce the issue:</h4>
On Xcode to support iOS 7 (Xcode 5) choose the titanium SDK 3.1.3 or 3.2.0. Delete the project build folder in the workspace, clean the project, reset simulator content.

<h4>Add breakpoint in Win2.js & Win3.js (any line is fine)</h4>
<h4>Build the app in iOS 7 simulator.</h4>
<h4>When you run the app with above steps you can see the Win2.js and Win3.js is also get called as soon as app starts. But if you compile the same app using 3.1.2.GA or lesser than that (make sure that you are doing the above steps before compiling it with different sdk) Win2.js and Win3.js will not get called on app start-up.</h4>

<h4>Additional info</h4>
Similar issue happens if they replace TabGroup with coverflow also.

   This was a conscious design change where we process the rootWindows url contexts as soon as possible for a smoother UI transition when switching tabs. If you have a use case which requires this functionality, please let us know.</li>

   IMO this shouldn't be in a minor version and should be mentioned explicitly in the release notes. It took me hours to find out why my app stopped working and why it suddenly was so slow. My use case is that I have 4 tabs in a tab group with 4 seperate .js files. Most windows do one or more API calls and calculations on load and some repeat this with the focus event. This was OK and the interaction and events were dealing with this. But SDK 3.1.3 resulted in strange behavior and the error mentioned in this issue. It took me some hours to change the code and I have to re-test the entire app.
   Plus what are possible performance risks with this change?</li>

   I'm running into the same issue. I want the first tab to load quickly.  The user may not even see the remaining tabs.  Is there an option to get the old behavior?</li>

   We are running into the same issue as well. In our app tab1 win1 is the main menu, which needs to load fast. The other tabs (Contact Us, etc) are rarely, if ever opened. Is there an option to get the old behaviour?</li>

   Closing ticket as "Won't Fix". There has been no update for a number of years. If there is any problem, please open a new ticket.</li>
