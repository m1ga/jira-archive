   As far as i can see this looks like an Apple instruments bug. 
   
   From my testing it looks like instruments in Xcode 5 is having some sort of problem with our apps. Its actually not the app itself that is freezing, its instruments native app crashing on the app. Not sure we could do anything about this. Probably mark it as won't fix. </li>

   Verified issue fixed using:
   Mac OSX 10.9 Mavericks
   Titanium Studio, build: 3.2.0.201310312257
   Titanium SDK, build: 3.2.0.v20131031141643
   XCode: 5.0.1
   Instruments: 5.0.1
   iPhone 5c: 7.0.1
   
   Instruments recorded successfully and iPhone 5c ran smoothly. No crashes and no hangs occurred.</li>

   Was able to reproduce the original issue with the 3.1.3.GA stack and current 3.2.0 stack.
   
   Tested on:
   
   Appcelerator Studio, build: 3.1.3.201309132456, 3.2.0.201311211712
   SDK build: 3.1.3.GA, 3.2.0.v20131121163252 
   CLI: 3.1.3, 3.2.0-alpha
   Alloy: 1.2.2, 1.3.0 (it://github.com/appcelerator/alloy.git#1_3_X)
   Xcode: 5.0, 5.0.2
   Device: iphone 5 (7.0.2)</li>

   I just found when it happens, maybe that is your case too:
   App freezes if it was previously compiled in Debug Mode (i.e. Cmd + F11). *Re-compile it in Normal Mode before run in Instruments (i.e. Cmd + Shift + F11)* -- now working for me and I'm very happy.
   
   Maybe it not happened with me before because I usually used Normal Mode to run application, but *after updating to Xcode 5  Titanium Studio doesn't show console logs properly anymore -- very very annoying*. It shows me logs only in Debug Mode (btw, some parts of logs are missing there anyway, also filtering by log type is not working anymore). And I started using Debug Mode to run application since that time and then realized what Instruments are not working and only now I found why (see above). I think it hangs because waiting for Ti Studio debugger to connect, so need to compile in Normal Mode to prevent that.
   
   I hope next build of Titanium Studio will fix *logs issue*. Issue with Instruments maybe not an issue, as I explained above.</li>

   We cannot reproduce this issue with Xcode 5.1.1. Please retry and let us know.</li>

   I'm having the same issue when running my app in the Simulator. I tested this with multiple Titanium-based apps.
   After clicking on Leaks in Instruments, the app freezes after taking the first snapshot.
   This happens when taking the snapshot manually and when automatic snapshotting is enabled.
   
   When no snapshot is taken, the app runs without problems.
   
   SDK 3.2.3
   Alloy 1.3.1
   Xcode 5.1.1

   I am seeing this internally and members of QA in our team are having issues, not able to profile apps, with hanging on the splash screen. Am going to figure out a test case to run, its a blocker for us.</li>

   As I said, I found it happens if last time (before Instruments) your app was launched in "Debug" mode. It freezes, because waiting for Ti Studio debugger to connect to the app for debugging. Run it in "Run" mode (Cmd + Shift + F11  or Top menu "Run" -> "Run") first, then close it and try to run it through Instruments right after that -- works for me.</li>
<li>Ketan Majmudar 2014-05-23

   I will try that, but its specifically profiling from device (not the sim) that is causing us the issues. I haven't been building in debug mode, but will triple check the whole process.</li>

    Verified with test environment:
    
    Appc-Studio:3.3.0.201405211748
    sdk:3.3.0.v20140524224144
    acs:1.0.14
    alloy:1.4.0-alpha4
    npm:1.3.2
    titanium:3.3.0-alpha5
    titanium-code-processor:1.1.1
    xcode:5.1.1
    Device:iPhone5S(v7.1.1)
    OS:Maverick(10.9.2)
    
    App still freezes when run by instruments.
    Hence Reopening the issue.</li>

    If at all possible, I would like to have this issue be escalated. Can we also get an estimate on when this issue will be fixed? 
    
    We have some apps that we are trying to release to our enterprise client and their software review team is failing our app due to some memory leak concerns. These concerns seem to center around the Titanium SDK, and we can't disprove them because Instruments' Leak tool is behaving as reported in this ticket.
    
    Unless there is another way for us to be able to test iOS Titanium apps for memory leaks, we are not going to be able to use Titanium for this and future projects with this enterprise client.
    
    Many thanks!</li>
