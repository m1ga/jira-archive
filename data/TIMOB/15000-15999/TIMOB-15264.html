<h3>Description</h3>

By default the Android Action bar is Android API 11+, but Google has released a ActionBarCompat API Support Library as part of Android 4.3, to allow implementation of the action bar user interface design pattern back to Android 2.1 (API level 7) and higher.

The Android Support Library package is a set of code libraries that provide backward-compatible versions of Android framework APIs as well as features that are only available through the library APIs. Each Support Library is backward-compatible to a specific Android API level. This design means that your applications can use the libraries' features and still be compatible with devices running Android 1.6 (API level 4) and up.

Including the Support Libraries in your Android project is considered a best practice for application developers, depending on the range of platform versions your app is targeting and the APIs that it uses. Using the features the libraries provide can help you improve the look of your application, increase performance and broaden the reach of your application to more users. If you use the Android code template tools, you will notice that all the Android application templates include one or more of the Support Libraries by default.

The Support Libraries each target a base Android API level and each provides a different set of features. In order to effectively use the libraries, it is important to consider what features you want to support and understand what features are supported by each library at what Android API level. To get started, review the Support Library Features guide. After that, go to the Support Library Setup topic to learn how to incorporate the Support Libraries into your application. For more details about Support Library APIs, see the android.support packages in the API reference.

It is relatively easy to implement and the resulting API for the developers is almost the same. It would make our (Ti developers) lives a lot easier if we could use ActionBarCompat and not having to implement a 'Ti View' alternative for pre 11 Android phones.

   Priority: None
   Thats disappointing :S</li>
<li>Fokke Zandbergen 2013-09-18

   It is.</li>
<li>Timan Rebel 2013-09-18

   Especially because Appcelerator really wants to keep supporting 2.x</li>
<li>Fokke Zandbergen 2013-09-18

   We all should, since we know 2.x is going to be around for some time. And that's why Google made this compat version.</li>

   [~viezel] when tickets are moved from TC to TIMOB, we automatically assign them a priority of none to start, and then I get to choose a priority. The ticket only came into my project a few hours ago...give me a chance! :)
   
   We support Android versions based on market share. <= 2.2 is no longer viable, but 2.3+ is still a relatively large group of devices. We do have to balance adding support for this versus other features and bug fixes. I am unsure if we could fit this into the next feature release since we've already filled up the pipeline, but I will investigate it as soon as we can.

   Thanks for followup, Ingo.</li>
<li>Mads Moller 2013-09-18

   Ingo, Thanks for the update. I like that you guys keep 2.x in the loop. I have plenty of customers for the 2.x platform. I just think we need to follow Googles advice here. They did an effort to make actionbar, fragments etc available for 2.x, which is very nice. Lets support that :)

   Appreciate it [~ingo], thx.</li>

   Just adding a comment that when you do get around to supporting it, it must be a 100% "drop-in" library (no source code changes!) just as it is in native Android projects. If you hack it up like was done for the Facebook module then it's better to not waste the time on an unmaintainable project. </li>
