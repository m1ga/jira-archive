<h3>Description</h3>

A plugin for the code processor should be created that can flag use of Analytics and Breadcrumbs and whether or not metadata is being collected

Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is a hot topic for us as we sell the Appcelerator Platform and Analytics and Performance Management (Crash).

It would be a great feature if a code processor plugin can flag the use of Analytics Feature Events and Breadcrumbs since both of these can be used by a developer to pass PII to our backend.

It would be a governance tool, if a code processor plugin flagged the use of these instructions and flag them so the code could be reviewed by the customer to make sure PII is or is not being sent.
