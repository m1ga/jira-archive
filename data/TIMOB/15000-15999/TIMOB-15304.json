		"description": "When a smaller window is opened over a fullscreen window, the smaller window blocks entirely the accessibility voiceover of the lower window.  The smaller window should only cover the area that it physically covers, not the entire screen.\r\n\r\nI have included an app.js that shows this issue.\r\n\r\n1. Start the app w/ Accessibility Controls enabled\r\n2. Click the button and note that it is found by the accessibility system\r\n3. Double click (to actually click the button) and a smaller window is opened across the bottom (in red).\r\n4. Clicking on the red gives you accessibility info about the red area, but the button is not not accessible.  It is hidden entirely by the higher window.\r\n\r\nREGRESSION:\r\nThis is a regression from (roughly) 3.0 when the accessibility area was restricted to the area of the window, and the button would also have accessibility information available to the accessibility system.",

					"body": "Perhaps I was not clear.  I fully understand my code, and intended to have both windows open at once.  One window is smaller than the other,  click events flow properly to views in the lower window, but accessibility events do not work when a smaller window is open.  It is as if they are being blocked.  Even if this window is hidden, accessibility events are blocked.\n\nIf click events work, then accessibility should work as well.  If I can see something, and tap on it, then I accessibility information should be available for the user.\n\nPlease, before closing this issue, run my file with the accessibility inspector turned on and see what I'm talking about.  Please address this issue in your comments to close this issue.\n\nREPEAT: This is a regression from earlier releases.   This worked properly in the 3.0 timeframe, but is an issue in the latest releases.\n\nThanks.",
