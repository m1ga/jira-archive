<h3>Description</h3>

Unlike Development build, The Distribution build does not support x86 Chipset Architecture Devices. The support for the x86 devices should be available for Distribution build as well.

   @Michael: Should this be an SDK ticket?</li>
<li>Michael Xia 2013-03-13

   SDK needs to provide support for the x86 devices, and Studio needs to provide the option for users to select.</li>
<li>David Benko 2013-07-23

   Is this really going to be fixed on 3.2? Any thoughts on the release date? Thank you.</li>

   @Ygor actually yours is a duplicate of this one. It has been opened since Oct/12 and my guess is that the fix is not comming too soon because they always give a deadline and when that deadline has finally come, they postpone it.</li>
<li>Ygor Lemos 2013-10-16

   Is this going to be released on 3.1.4 or 3.2.0 only?
   
   Thanks</li>
<li>Ingo Muschenetz 2013-10-16

   [~ygbr] 3.2.0. There is unlikely to be a SDK 3.1.4 actual release, just availability of certain fixes on the CI loop.</li>

   To test: Remove any mention of ABIs from the android section of tiapp.xml and package and install on x86 device.
   Please check log cat output from the device. There may be an issue to be written there.</li>
