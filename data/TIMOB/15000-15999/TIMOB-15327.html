<h3>Description</h3>

The Titanium SDK needs to be ported to 64-bit iOS. There are 5 elements to this project:

1. Make the Titanium SDK source code 64-bit clean. This is TIMOB-15118.
2. Make the titanium_debugger source code 64-bit clean.
3. Make the titanium_profiler source code 64-bit clean.
4. Make the titanium_verify source code 64-bit clean.
5. Upgrade JavaScriptCore to a version that is 64-bit clean (probably safari-537.60-branch). This is TIMOB-11093.
6. Make the source code of our supported native modules 64-bit clean. The list of supported platforms is here: <a href="https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/mds/Module+Planning+Page" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/mds/Module+Planning+Page</a>
7. Extend the CLI to support 64-bit builds.
8. Update the module template with 64-bit support
9. Rebuild all modules with the 64-bit architecture

   The official release notes for 3.1.3 still show this is targeted for 3.2 release - this should be updated to reflect the change in version targeting.

   Has this issue been addressed? 
   
   Based on the Apple New Announcement at:

   64-bit and iOS 8 Requirements for New Apps
   
   October 20, 2014
   Starting February 1, 2015, new iOS apps uploaded to the App Store must include 64-bit support and be built with the iOS 8 SDK, included in Xcode 6 or later. To enable 64-bit in your project, we recommend using the default Xcode build setting of “Standard architectures” to build a single binary with both 32-bit and 64-bit code.

   We need to have 64-bit support for iOS apps built with the iOS 8 SDK. Can this be included in the 3.4.1.GA TiSDK or the 3.5.0.GA TiSDK? 
   
   Thanks,
   Travis</li>

   This looks like a *deadline of Feb 1st, 2015*. Though we've seen Appcelerator hit their targets before:)</li>

   agree should be high priority, if we can't submit apps...</li>

   Looked for this issue today based on apple's announcement. Seems critical

   Just an idea, because the warnings on both validation and submit in Xcode are quite alarming (even while it says you have until Feb 1), I think a lot of people will be scared and.... blame Appcelerator for it.
   
   So, perhaps it is possible to add an alert in the next patch release of the CLI and Studio that shows only for <code>dist-appstore</code>  to inform people that they will get this warning from Apple once they validate/submit and they can safely ignore it?</li>
<li>Joseph Sachs 2014-11-20

   As I understand it, all iOS Modules used in our Apps need to be 64-bits as well. Could be tricky - as some/many won't update.</li>

    All included issues are resolved.</li>
