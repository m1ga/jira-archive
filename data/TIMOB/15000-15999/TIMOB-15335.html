<h3>Description</h3>

After upgrading to 3.1.3.GA the CLI no longer outputs to the console when using an iOS7 device.  The customer states that if they switch to iOS 6.1 then the console outputs return.  The customer builds using Titanium CLI only, not studio.

   I test this with Titanium SDK 3.1.3.GA as well as SDK 3.2.0 with iOS 7 Simulator and it works as expected.
   
   We have never supported application logging to the CLI for device builds. The would need to use Xcode's device console to see the debug messages.
   
   Maybe if there were reproducable instructions I could track down the problem. I need to know step-by-step instructions, possibly some sample code, and versions of Xcode, Titanium CLI, Titanium SDK, and Node.js.</li>

   It seems this tickets refers to the problem with XCode 5.0.x as discussed in Titans list.
   
   Shouldn't it be linked to [TIMOB-15681] ?</li>

   [~ygbr] This is working in Titanium 3.2. I'm still evaluating the effort to backport this to 3.1.x. Follow this ticket to track the progress: TIMOB-15681.</li>

   I experience this as well, and it is highly annoying...</li>

   Would love to get this in 3.1.x, not fun having no logs!</li>
