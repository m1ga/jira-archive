<h3>Description</h3>

This ID has to by unique per device, the difference is the user can setup that the app can't access to this id and is reset when the device is erased.

read something about this class <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/AdSupport/Reference/ASIdentifierManager_Ref/ASIdentifierManager.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/AdSupport/Reference/ASIdentifierManager_Ref/ASIdentifierManager.html</a>

   Thank you for the suggestion. What is the intent with using this ID? From the docs:
   
   "The ASIdentifierManager class provides apps with access to an identifier that can be used only for serving advertisements, as well as a flag which indicates whether a user has limited ad tracking.
   
   This class is expected to be used by developers who are implementing a system for serving ads. These organizations typically provide app developers with the code that interacts with this class. App developers may need to link against the Ad Support framework to use that code, but they should not need to interact with the ASIdentifierManager class directly."
   
   Please provide more information as to the expected use case and I will be happy to reopen.</li>

   To track things like Demographics (age, interests) in Google Analytics, it needs the unique IDFA identifier.
   IDFA is also used for serving ads in admob.
   Would be nice to have this natively supported in Titanium.</li>

   Hi!
   
   Any updates on this one?
   
   IDFA is needed for conversion tracking on Adwords and for deeplink tracking platforms.
   
   This is a very important ID for iOS developers that drive their user acquisition through Ads and also for user engagement tracking.</li>

   Why is this marked as resolved?
   
   Is there any way to access IDFA using Ti SDK recently?</li>

   Also for Parity it would be nice to have access to ADID - Android Advertising ID (AdvertisingIdClient.Info getAdvertisingIdInfo) too.
   
   If we could get something like Ti.Platform.idfa or Ti.Platform.adid or Ti.Platform.advertisingId it would help a lot specially when using server-side integration with Adwords and manually tracking user engagement / install tracking.
   
   It would also help to have access to the variable indicating if the user allows ad-tracking (isLimitAdTrackingEnabled() on Android / isAdvertisingTrackingEnabled for iOS) using something like Ti.Platform.adTracking (bool)</li>

   I don't know if this is enough of a reason to consider reopening this issue, but here is my case: I'm working with the PubNative library for ads, which serves ads (unless I'm very mistaken) just by API calls. You can live without their SDK, which I think is very good for an Appcelerator developer, since the SDKs provided by ad-serving companies can fall short in many ways.
   
   So, since there's no SDK, and since I have to send the IDFA as a parameter, I'd love an easy way to get it from the Titanium SDK.</li>

   Closing tickets that need more info from 2015 and earlier. Is this is in error, please reopen.</li>
