From the docs:\r\n\r\n\"The ASIdentifierManager class provides apps with access to an identifier that can be used only for serving advertisements, as well as a flag which indicates whether a user has limited ad tracking.\r\n\r\nThis class is expected to be used by developers who are implementing a system for serving ads. These organizations typically provide app developers with the code that interacts with this class. App developers may need to link against the Ad Support framework to use that code, but they should not need to interact with the ASIdentifierManager class directly.\"\r\n\r\nPlease provide more information as to the expected use case and I will be happy to reopen.",
