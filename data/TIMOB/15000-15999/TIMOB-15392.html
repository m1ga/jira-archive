<h3>Description</h3>

This may be a device specific issue with the device: GETAC z710. We have not been able to test the issue as we do not have the device.

The device comes with a dock and the customer has found that undocking the device causes the application to restart/crash. Docking the device causes the app to background and return to an undesired screen. This also occurs with the Kitchen Sink app.

Attached are the resulting log files when the restart/crash occurs when docking and undocking the device.

Please also see their attached tiapp.xml file.

Any suggestions on things they could try? Is this something that is very device specific that we have no control over?
