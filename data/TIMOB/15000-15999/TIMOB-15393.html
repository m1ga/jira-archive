<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Feature Request</h4>
Customers would like to use static images which are displayed in app. They are mainly looking for displaying different images for <=iOS6 and iOS7. 

- TO SUPPORT BOTH IOS 6 AND IOS 7:
{quote}
Two asset catalogs will be needed for apps that need to support both versions. The layout in iOS 6 and iOS 7 will be different since there are changes in metrics and in styles of UIKit controls and views. Bars, bar controls, content views and temporary views have a different appearance in different iOS versions so two asset catalogs are needed. Custom assets, such as custom buttons, background images or other controls, will be stored in these catalogs and loaded conditionally in runtime.

   This will not be available in 3.3.0. We will revisit it in a future version.</li>

   It's worth noting Titanium iOS does support asset catalogs if you have app thinning enable. It will automatically put your images into asset catalogs provided you follow the <code>@2x</code>, <code>@3x</code>, <code>~iphone</code>, and <code>~ipad</code> tokens.</li>
