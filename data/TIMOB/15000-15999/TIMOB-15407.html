<h3>Description</h3>

In production builds, we're still calling "Log.d(TAG, a + b) " in many places (300+), generating unnecessary strings. We need to conduct an experiment to see how much memory and performance boost we'll get by removing these strings.

   Experiment Results:
       1. I created a native Android app printing Log.d(Tag, MSG) 20k times, 100x, then take the average. The average is ~220ms. This shows that the performance improvement is extremely negligible. 
       2. I then created a simple Titanium app, run it, and count how many logs we print. With one window, one button, and one view, we print 22 debug logs. This shows that the logs are not being used frequently.
   
   From these experiments, It is definitely not worth our efforts to optimize this process since we'll get nothing from it.
