		"description": "I would like to be passed the x, y coordinates into the itemclick event (in the same way that the click event passes in x,y coordinates) for a ListView. I want to be able to simulate a custom control by clicking on an item in the ListView and bringing up a transparent window with my control on top of the item that I clicked on. However, I don't know where to place the control if I don't have the x, y coordinates. This is especially difficult if the window scrolls.\r\n\r\nWhen I first wrote the bug, I had tested this on iOS and by looking at the document I thought that 'accessoryClicked' was the only field that was not common to both Android and iOS. In the debugger I found out that bindId is not passed in the itemclick event parameters on Android but x and y coordinates are passed in the event. Can I get both bindId and x,y coordinates passed into the event on both platforms? Also, can you update the documentation so that it at least correctly states the parameters being passed in?",
