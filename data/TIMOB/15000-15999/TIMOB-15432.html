<h3>Description</h3>

In iOS7 image on Button added to Toolbar is always blue.

The Toolbar itself can still have it's color changed, so if changed to red / blue / green / etc. can contrast badly with the Button's blue image color.

Screenshot attached.

   Could you please provide some sample code?</li>
<li>Gavin Harriss 2013-10-09

   Actually, I've found that you can set the button color but not where you'd expect it.
   
   If you set the tintColor on the parent Window rather than the Toolbar itself then you can control the toolbar buttons color.
   
   A bit counter-intuitive! I only discovered this as I was trying to change the color of the blue button in the title bar. </li>

   [~gavinharriss] could you attach a test application?</li>
<li>Gavin Harriss 2013-11-20

   Sorry, I've not had a chance to create a test application for you, but here's the code that does and doesn't work...
   
   This WON'T set the toolbar button colors:
   
   var toolbar = Ti.UI.iOS.createToolbar({
   	tintColor: '#FFF'
   });
   
   
   This WILL set the toolbar button colors for a toolbar added to the window:
   
   var win = Ti.UI.createWindow({
   	tintColor: '#FFF'
   });</li>
