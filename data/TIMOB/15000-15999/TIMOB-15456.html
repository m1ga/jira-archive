<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Description</h4>
Installing VMWare Fusion 5 or 6 and using blackberry simulator works partially.
User can click on the screen and hit buttons but cannot use slide features such as sliding across home screen to see apps or scrolling down a page on browser.

Also to note is that the Simulator never fetches an IP address so cannot be linked to run applications on through Studio.

<h4>Steps To Reproduce</h4>
1. Install VMWare Fusion 5 or 6
2. Download and install latest BlackBerry simulator
3. Install the simulator through VMWare Fusion
4. Run the simulation through VMWare Fusion
5. Try scrolling around and note that the IP address in the bottom left corner is never obtained.

<h4>Actual Result</h4>
Simulators swipe function does not work.
Simulator IP address is never obtained

<h4>Expected Result</h4>
Simulator functions like a phone, swipe enabled.
IP address to be obtained so it can be linked to Studio

   Found a fix for this bug
   Mac OSX 10.9 Mavericks
   VMWare Fusion 6.0.1
   
   <h4>Steps To Fix</h4>
   Load up VMWare Fusion 6.0.1
   Select "Create a custom Virtual Machine"
   Select "Other -> Other (32bit)"
   Select "Use an existing virtual machine"
   Select the blackberry simulator you have already downloaded
   Select "Share this virtual disk with the virtual machine that created it"
   Finish the set up
   Shut down the simulation and open the simulations settings
   Set the amount of Memory to a minimum of 1024Mb
   Make sure that Accelerated 3D Graphics is turned on
   Once it crashes on the VMWare screen after loading about 3/4 of the way suspend the simulation by closing the simulator
   After the simulator has suspended and closed rerun the simulation to carry on from where it left off
   It should carry on loading from where it had crashed before
   Select partition 1 and let the next part set by default
   
   Also note that the simulators IP is now set at the bottom as well</li>

   +UPDATE+
   This bug no longer occurs on the official release of Mavericks.
   
   Mac OSX 10.9 Mavericks GM (13A603)
   Titanium Studio, Build: 3.1.3.201309132423

   <h4>Steps To Create Working BlackBerry Simulator</h4>
   1. Create a custom virtual machine
   2. Select Other -> Other (32bit)
   3. Use an existing virtual machine
   4. Link it to the simulator file downloaded from the BlackBerry developer website or from Momentics
   5. Click "customize the settings" on the last page of the wizard, it will prompt you to save first
   6. Set the RAM to a minimum of 1024Mb
   7. Turn on Accelerated 3D graphics
   
   Run the simulator and let it choose its own partition and screen type.
   
   +Extra Information+
   If VMWare Fusion is installed and running prior to downloading the simulator through Momentics, then Momentics will automatically set up the virtual device and run it.</li>
