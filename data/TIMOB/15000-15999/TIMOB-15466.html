<h3>Description</h3>

After on-boarding two separate enterprise customers (SMC Treviso and HD Supply GSC) to AppceleratorStudio and Platform, LiveView does not work.  On both occasions, we confirmed the build and ran on emulator.  After enabling LiveView, the build fails and will not run.  You can instantly fix the issue by disabling LiveView.  Here is the log file of the error:

   Hi Daniel,
   
   Could you attach the console log as well as a screenshot of the app crashing? That would be helpful for us to debug the issue.
   
   Thanks.

   I have obtained a sample log from one of the three customers that was unable to activate this feature, I have added it to the description.  But I hope this is enough info for you.</li>
<li>Michael Xia 2013-10-18

   This should be fixed by the commit in TIMOB-15009. It's available in the latest Studio 3.2.0 nightly build.

   [~CSullivan], [~Mxia] wanted me to give you the "studio log 2", "diagnostic log 2", the project source code, and the screen shots, which are all attached.  And the source code is located here: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/3cugh7z0zf0jmw8/21stAndroid%202.zip" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.dropbox.com/s/3cugh7z0zf0jmw8/21stAndroid%202.zip</a></li>

   The problem is caused by the corrupted .DS_Store file.
   I just deleted it and the app runs fine for me with liveview.
   
   <code><pre>
   $ rm -rf 21stAndroid/i18n/.DS_Store
   </pre></code>
   
   When reviewing the code I found merge conflict notations in the Readme.md so they might want to also review thier code to ensure there are no others.
   To help avoid some issues they should add .DS_Store and all other system generated none project files to their .gitignore</li>

   Caused by corrupt .DS_Store possible from merge conflict</li>
<li>Daniel Fortner 2013-12-05

   Thanks Christian.  I will confirm this on the client's machine and let you know how it goes.</li>
