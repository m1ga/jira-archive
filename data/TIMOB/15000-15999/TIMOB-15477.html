<h3>Description</h3>

The queryMusicLibrary can query everything in the device's Music Library except for the ability to query Playlists, which is a key feature of the Music Library. This is a key missing component of the function and I believe it should be added. With the already setup queryMusicLibrary function it should not be that hard to add the ability to search Playlists as well.
