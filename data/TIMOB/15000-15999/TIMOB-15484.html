   Yes this should be automatically set to true - without the need to set an implicit property.  There must be many more people who want this automatically applied than would ever not want it used.  Plus many newbies have apps that exhibit the incorrect behaviour - not knowing this could have been fixed by a property setting that is neither obvious nor apparent without first searching for the solution - when again as newbies they may not know there was a problem to search for!</li>

   I practically use it as a default on all my tiapp.xml for android apps... Unfortunately this is a reality... another ancient unresolved android bug that haunts users for 4 years and counting...</li>
<li>Ygor Lemos 2013-10-30

   So my vote is obviously yes... this should be the default...</li>

   Yes, we also use it in all apps, so making it true by default makes sense.</li>

   Yes, please make it true by default.  We have
   <property name="ti.android.bug2373.finishfalseroot" type="bool">true</property>
   in all of our apps, but it would be nice to not have to remember to add it on new apps.
   
   Also, +1 for Malcolm's comment about newbies not knowing about this.</li>
