		"description": "h4. Problem Description\r\n\r\nWhen using a ListView on Android with a Holo theme, there are discrepancies between how the TableView was originally displayed, and how the ListView is displayed. This is especially apparent in the section-titles, and in buttons on a table-view row, neither of which seem to change when the theme changes. See the attached screenshots.\r\n\r\nh4. Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Create a new mobile project\r\n2. Import the attached test case\r\n3. Click in the tab 1, should show you a tableview\r\n4. Click in the tab 2, should show you the same data, but implemented in a listview.\r\n5. The theme in both cases should be the same, but it's different.\r\n\r\n\r\nh4. Extra info \r\nI have attached a test-project to demonstrate this issue. The app has two tabs, one containing a TableView, and one containing a ListView. Both tables have a similar buildup and should look identical. However, they don't.\r\n\r\nThe project in the zip-file contains a git repository. Switch between different commits to view the issue in the default theme, holo dark (currently selected) and holo light. \r\n",

					"body": "I've attached a patch to titanium_mobile that solves the problem of the switch theming for me. Instead of creating the switch programatically, I'm now using the inflater to create the switch from a .xml file (the same way that Listview-items are created). For some reason, this causes the button to be themed correctly.\n\nHowever, this patch is not pull-request material:\n- I'm still not sure what the underlaying issue is here. Even in the old (non-working) case; Buttons are created in the same way, and since theming in Android should be hierarchical, I think they should have the same theme. I'm not sure why this works, and the old code didn't.\n- Right now, the 'SWITCH_STYLE_CHECKBOX' is created in a different way than the 'SWITCH_STYLE_TOGGLEBUTTON', but I can rectify that if required.\n- I haven't overridden the 'onLayout' method that was originally overridden. This doesn't seem to cause problems for me, but it might for you.\n\n\nIf you need to theme the section-header, that's a bit simpler.\n1) Build the android app\n2) Create a platform/android/res/layout directory in the root of your project.\n3) Copy build/android/res/layout/titanium_ui_list_header_or_footer.xml into the newly created directory.\n\nNow, the theming of the header and footer can be customised by editing the .xml file.\n",
