<h3>Description</h3>

Since an recent update my Android dev environment has stopped working. 

Even though I have all the pre-requisite SDK versions installed (and have had for a while) and the locations set in the Studio prefs, I'm getting the message : 

"[Android SDK Home] No Android SDKs were found under the specified SDK location"

I've tried re-installing android and the SDKs again to no avail.


Others are having the issue too, but I can't seem to resolve this. Any ideas what's happened?

   I had upgraded my CLI to 3.2.0. 
   
   Downgrading to 3.1.2 has fixed it. But now I can't try the 3.2.0 Ti SDK. 
   
   How can I get around this?</li>
<li>Chris Barber 2013-10-25

   This was probably an issue with an earlier 3.2 SDK. I tried to reproduce it and it appears to work just fine as long as you have the latest Titanium CLI 3.2 and select the latest Titanium SDK 3.2 (master) as selected sdk.</li>

   This bug still exists on the recently released SDK 3.2.0.GA
   
   No offence, but the current state of the SDK 3.2.0 is "useless" for the Android platform.
   
   To reproduce the problem, you will need to trying a fresh installation. Then you will experience the following:
   
   1. Even if you have android SDK installed, titanium will try to download and install it again instead of using the existing one.
   
   2. After titanium downloads and installs the sdk, it will still not recognized it.
   
   Thanks ... and keep up the good work.

   I had this problem too. I tried everything and reinstalled many times. 
   After a few hours I stumbled uppon a folder /opt on my Mac (just updated to Mavericks)
   
   This /opt folder was owned by root and had permissions 700. Only Imagemagick was installed there.
   
   I did : sudo chmod -R 755 /opt and this problem was gone for me. 
   
   @Abdoulaye Siby, I hope this points you to a solution...</li>

   Hey,
   
   Had the same problem. What solved it for me was adding an AVD to the android virtual device manager.
   
   Hope it helps.</li>

   Same for me.
   
   ANDROID_SDK_PATH = $HOME/Library/android-sdk-macosx (installed by Titanium IDE )
   Titanium Studio, build: 3.2.1.201402041146</li>

   The problem is in titanium config.json file (under /Users/sam/.titanium in mac). the file has a json parsing error that is effecting the entire studio. 
   i had "/Users/sam/Library/Application Support/Titanium/"}}" string appended in the end of the file. after removing it all went well</li>
