<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Description</h4>
During a test on dynamics features I ran into a "critical" error.
As part of a messaging application which displays incoming messages on the right and outgoing messages on the left I happened across multiple errors in the console.

<h4>Expected Result</h4>
Console should just display LEFT or RIGHT depending on the type of message.

<h4>Result</h4>
Console displayed errors and slowed the application.

   I'm not sure you take care of the message.
   Even if it is a common log, with a "Info" level, the text is explicit

   I think you should consider this message seriously and make Titanium stable for LTR as nobody knows what Apple will do with in a future iOS release...
   Just imagine that iOS8 change this notice into a fatal error?
   
   You have the opportunity to prevent a potential crash, just consider this message as serious and change priority to a higher level than "low"
   
   Thank you</li>

   [~sdowse] and others, I see references here:
   
   <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19599266/invalid-context-0x0-under-ios-7-0-and-system-degradation" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19599266/invalid-context-0x0-under-ios-7-0-and-system-degradation</a>
   
   But a number of people report that if you reset the content and settings of the simulator, it goes away. Can you try that?</li>

   Attaching the sample code that was used for testing.
   
   *Setup:*
   1. After downloading and unzipping attachment, replace the default Titanium app with this Resources content
   2. Install onto device
   3. Go to Messages
   4. Start typing messages in the text field</li>
<li>Mark Mokryn 2014-03-08

   +1 on this issue. Not sure how resetting the content and settings is relevant: I started to see this issue **after** I reset the simulator earlier today.</li>
<li>Ingo Muschenetz 2014-03-14

   Can't reproduce at all ATM, so deferring until we get a better test case.</li>
<li>Paras Mishra 2014-07-03

   I am not able to reproduce the issue, used the attached application using the following environment
   
   Environment used:
   Tested on:
   Device : iPhone 5s , iOS version : 7.1.1
   SDK: 3.3.0.v20140625133319
   CLI version : 3.3.0-rc4
   OS : MAC OSX 10.9.2
   Alloy:  1.4.0-rc3
   ACS: 1.0.14
   npm:1.3.2
   LiveView: 1.0.4
   Appcelerator Studio, build: 3.3.0.201406271159
   titanium-code-processor: 1.1.1
   XCode : 5.1.1</li>
<li>Hans Knöchel 2016-08-03

   Closing this issue as "Cannot Reproduce" for now, since we have been unable to see that issue appear over the last 2 years. I am pretty sure it was an issue in the iOS logs that have been fixed internally. If anyone still sees this issue - especially linked with an error  - please let us know. Thanks!</li>
