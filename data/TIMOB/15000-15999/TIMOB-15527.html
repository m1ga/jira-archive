<h3>Description</h3>

On iOS and Android the Geolocation 'location' event has the following properties: <a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#</a>!/api/Titanium.Geolocation-event-location

Looking at BlackBerry's GeolocationSession.cpp line 40, only latitude and longitude are set in the coords object. 

Besides that success/error and code are not implemented (we now have to check for 'isBlackBerry || event.success' and assume there are no errors), the coords object is missing vital properties as well:

* "altitude",
* "accuracy",
* "altitudeAccuracy",
* "heading",
* "speed",
* "timestamp"

Without accuracy, altitude and timestamp, we can never do accurate location tracking BB10.

   Any idea when this could be reviewed and will appear in the nightly builds of Ti SDK? Because we really need it to finish our BB10 app. Thanks!</li>

   Just a bump to ask again when this could be reviewed. We are ready to complete the port of our iOS and Android Snowciety apps to BlackBerry 10, but cannot until this is resolved. Please let us know</li>

   Closing as resolved.</li>
