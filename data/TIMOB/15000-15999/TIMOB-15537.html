<h3>Description</h3>

The programmer should *never* have to run "Clean". I see this solution being proposed for numerous issues with builds not updating properly. Running "Clean" is not an acceptable solution. The build process should be smart enough to rebuild everything that needs rebuilding. 

I assert that when there is a process in which a "Clean" is required to correctly build, that is a bug in titanium.

Thoughts?

   The point I'm making is that if we remove the Clean Project option, it will force us to fix bugs and have a higher-quality build process - instead of just saying "oh the user can just clean the project if they need to".</li>
