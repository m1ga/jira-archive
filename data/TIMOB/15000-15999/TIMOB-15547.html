<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Problem Description</h4>
When adding a Label to a TableViewRow and sets hasChild on IOS7, the label is pushed twice as much to the left as on IOS 6. I know the right/left default on IOS6 is 8 and 15 on IOS7. But when on IOS7 the Label is pushed 2*15 pixels to the left by the hasChild icon on IOS 6 it is only pushed 1*8 pixels


<h4>Steps to Reproduce</h4>
When adding a Label to a TableViewRow and sets hasChild on IOS7, the label is pushed twice as much to the left as on IOS 6. I know the right/left default on IOS6 is 8 and 15 on IOS7. But when on IOS7 the Label is pushed 2*15 pixels to the left by the hasChild icon on IOS 6 it is only pushed 1*8 pixels

Please see the attached images, or try:

1. Create a new Alloy project.
2. Drop the Attached index.xml to the Views folder
3. Run the project on IOS 7
4. In the Simulator menu select Debug -> Color blended laysers
5. Look at the Right sides of the labelse
6. Do step 3-5 in the IOS 6.1 simulator (edit right to 8 on labels), see the difference

Actual Result
The label is pushed twice on IOS 7

Expected Result
The label should be pushed once like on IOS 6
