   Allen has verified the repro of this issue on my machine.</li>

   Caused by the fix for TIMOB-13138.  In the old python scripts, we don't include the network jar in production builds, so with the change in TIMOB-13138 which always require the network jar, this will fail.
   
   The new Andriod Build CLI always includes network so we are ok there.  I'll submit a PR shortly to modify the old build scripts just in case.</li>
