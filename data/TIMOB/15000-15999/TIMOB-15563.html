<h3>Description</h3>

*not regression* occurs in CLI 3.1.2
<h4>To reproduce</h4>
1. Create a project with the only one Target Platform (e.g. ios)
2. cd to this project and run command "ti project" - observe the only iOS platform is set to "true"
3. Use ti build command and target android and mobile web platforms

<h4>Actual result</h4>
Although we created project only for iOS, project will build successfully for different platforms as well, and platform folders will appear in a project's build folder.

   This is by design. When you create a project, it will only copy the default resources for the specified platforms and sets the deployment targets in the tiapp.xml.
   
   Once the project has been created, the deployment targets are only used by Studio so that it can call the project command to copy the default resources for the new deployment targets.
   
   There is no enforcing of the deployment targets at build time. It's not necessary and enabling such a feature would hinder the developer experience.</li>
