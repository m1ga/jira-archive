<h3>Description</h3>

Looks like a regression of TISTUD-5283...

<code><pre>
var win = Ti.UI.createWindow({
    backgroundColor: 'white'
});
 
var b1 = Ti.UI.createButton({
    title: 'Button',
    top: 50,
    height: Ti.UI.SIZE,
    width: Ti.UI.SIZE
});
 
b1.addEventListener('click', function() {
    Ti.API.warn('this is warn output');
    Ti.API.info('this is info output');
    Ti.API.debug('this is debug output');
});
 
win.add(b1);
win.open();
</pre></code>

*Output*
nothing - console is blank


*Expected output*

[WARN] :   this is warn output
[DEBUG] :  this is debug output
[INFO] :   this is info output

   This appears to be happening when building with the Titanium CLI; Studio appears to show the console output just fine.</li>
<li>Matthew Delmarter 2013-10-23

   That's not true for me Seth. It does not show any console logging output inside Studio. 
   
   Maybe you are not using the exact same environment?</li>
<li>Mauro Parra-Miranda 2013-10-23

   Hello,
   just go and update to 3.1.4.RC, and the new Studio,  which have support for Mavericks. If the issue is still there, we can reopen it.

   @Mauro
   I am testing against the latest studio, as well as 3.1.4.v20131016191639
   
   Still doesn't work with the CLI. It works with Studio when ran with the debug settings.</li>
<li>Mauro Parra-Miranda 2013-10-23

   Seth, 
   
   can you please paste your Studio log (whatever is there, just to take a look). 
   
   Thanks!
   
   
   Best,
   
   Mauro 
   </li>
<li>Mauro Parra-Miranda 2013-10-23

   There is evidence of this happening with 3.1.4. </li>
<li>Matthew Delmarter 2013-10-23

   @Seth - I wonder why I do not see the output inside Studio and you do? Are you using Mavericks?</li>
<li>Seth Benjamin 2013-10-23

   Mauro,
   
   As i mentioned it would seem Studio is fine. It's the CLI that I am having issues with, although @Matthew seems to be having trouble with Studio.
   
   Thanks,
   Seth</li>
<li>Matthew Delmarter 2013-10-23

   Just to clarify - I also have trouble with the CLI. Both Studio and CLI are included in the issue.</li>
<li>Seth Benjamin 2013-10-23

    @Matthew - Im using 10.9 and I launch the sim using the debug configuration. It doesn't seem to work any other way.</li>
<li>Michael Xia 2013-10-23

    We should take a look at the CLI side first and resolve there, then move to Studio if the output is still not seen from Studio console.
    </li>
<li>Matej 2013-10-24

    Similiar issue. I have been using Ti 3.1.3.GA and Xcode 5 (Mountain Lion) everything worked ,but yesterday I updated Xcode to 5.0.1 and I can't see any console output with iOS 7 simulator (iOS 6.1 does work). </li>
<li>Tony Lukasavage 2013-10-24

    I'm seeing the issue using only the latest CLI (no studio), pulled from github today</li>
<li>Matej 2013-10-25

    After downgrade Xcode from 5.0.1 to 5.0 the console works again.</li>
<li>Sebastian Klaus 2013-10-25

    That's my experience, too.</li>
<li>Sebastian Klaus 2013-10-25

    After starting the simulator in debug-mode

    I could switch back to "Resource" view and see all logs as normal

<li>Sebastian Klaus 2013-10-25

    I tried with a complete restart, bit that won't work.</li>
<li>Seth Benjamin 2013-10-25

    It would seem the common cause here is XCode 5.0.1, if anything that'd be a good place to start. @Tony, I was seeing this with the latest stable and the edge release of the CLI. I don't believe this is SDK related. CLI & Studio seem to be borked with updates to XCode.
    
    Is there a chance this will be patched sometime soon before the 3.2 release? Seems odd to peg it then when something like this can drastically change development workflows for customers and patrons of the Open-Source code.</li>
<li>Ingo Muschenetz 2013-10-25

    I admit, I'm sort of perplexed that an XCode change would cause this. In both cases, you are using the same version of iOS SDK and emulator?</li>
<li>Mark Ross 2013-10-25

    I have NOT updated to Mavericks, I only updated to XCode 5.0.1.  After that update, I no longer see logging using the iPhone simulator in Studio 3.1.3, so i can confirm its likely due to XCode update and not Mavericks.</li>
<li>Matej 2013-10-25

    Ingo:
    
    XCode 5.0.1 (Simulator iOS 7) -> console doesn't work (I am not sure ,but simulator is I think iOS 7.0.3 maybe this is problem)
    XCode 5.0.1 (Simulator  iOS 6.1) -> console does work
    XCode 5 -> No problem
    
    *On 100% problem is not in an OS X I tested it with Mountain Lion and Mavericks as well.</li>
<li>Sebastian Klaus 2013-10-25

    I agree with Mark and Matej.
    
    But also I can confirm, that apps started in debug mode show the log as normal.</li>
<li>Wilson Luu 2013-10-25

    This is what I found after my investigation:
    
    Warn, info, and debug information *appears* in the console view when you debug the above app on an iOS simulator (i.e. Right-click > Debug As > iPhone Simulator). Verified on:
    
    Titanium Studio, build: 3.1.3.201309132423, 3.1.4.201310152018
    Ti CLI: 3.1.2
    SDK build: 3.1.3.GA
    OS: Mountain Lion (10.8.5), Maverick (10.9)
    Xcode: 5.0, 5.0.1
    
    *However,* warn, info, and debug information *do not appear* in the console view when you run the above app on an iOS simulator (i.e. Right-click > Run As > iPhone Simulator) using either Xcode 5.0 or 5.0.1 and targeting Simulator Version 7.0 from Studio. Also, verified on:
    
    Titanium Studio, build: 3.1.3.201309132423, 3.1.4.201310152018
    Ti CLI: 3.1.2
    SDK build: 3.1.3.GA
    OS: Mountain Lion (10.8.5), Maverick (10.9)
    Xcode: 5.0, 5.0.1 </li>
<li>Malcolm Hollingsworth 2013-10-26

    Whilst the debug mode does show the logging, it also clears the compiling information when the first entry is displayed.</li>
<li>Alex Peckham 2013-10-28

    I can confirm I have latest version of Titanium (build: 3.1.3.201309132423) and am running Mavericks - I have the same error. I was also experiencing the issue on Mountain Lion before I upgraded the OS. 
    
    </li>
<li>Dan Tamas 2013-10-28

    I can also confirm that with Xcode 5.0.1 all the console is gone :(</li>
<li>Dan Tamas 2013-10-28

    It seems that the log file that before was created in the documentsDirectory is not created anymore for some reason.
    I even try to hack the SDK to comment the #ifdef __LOG__ID__ (in main.m) but no love :(
    
    </li>
<li>Ingo Muschenetz 2013-10-28

    Hi All...we believe this is a result of the simulator version "7.0.3" included with XCode 5.0.1. Previous versions of simulators did not include a 3rd segment, and this appears to confuse ios-sim and the CLI. We are working on a fix and hope to have one available in a nightly build shortly.</li>
<li>Sebastian Klaus 2013-10-28

    Thanks a lot, Ingo!</li>

<li>Seth Benjamin 2013-11-01

    @Chris, Awesome. Can't wait to try this. Any ETA as to when this will be accepted and merged? I really would like to test this out.</li>
<li>Chris Barber 2013-11-01

    [~animecyc] ASAP :)</li>
<li>Matthew Delmarter 2013-11-02

    Is there a simple patch I can apply to 3.1.3 to get the output working again?</li>
<li>Chris Barber 2013-11-02

    [~mdelmarter] Sorry, there's no patch. We may backport to 3.1.X, but for now, it's only in 3.2 (master).</li>
<li>Seth Benjamin 2013-11-04

    @Chris, Is Nov 14th a good estimate as to when 3.2 (where this fix was made) will be getting released?</li>
<li>Chris Barber 2013-11-04

    [~animecyc] This fix has been merged into master, so you can play with it today. Just don't use CI builds for production work.
    
    <code><pre>
    sudo npm install -g git://github.com/appcelerator/titanium.git
    ti sdk install -b master -d
    </pre></code>
    
    To get back to stable:
    
    <code><pre>
    sudo npm install -g titanium@3.1.2
    ti sdk select 3.1.3.GA
    </pre></code>
    
    As far as the actual release date is concerned, I would say Nov 14th is NOT a good estimate. I'm not sure exactly when 3.2 will ship, but certainly not Nov 14th. I'm sure there's at least one watcher on this ticket that has an approximate release date range.</li>
<li>Neeraj Gupta 2013-11-04

    Release 3.2.0 is scheduled to be released around the middle of December. We also plan to merge this fix to 3.1.X branch shortly.</li>
<li>Seth Benjamin 2013-11-05

    </li>
<li>Ingo Muschenetz 2013-11-05

    [~animecyc] Yes, those dates were adjusted forward to our code freeze dates for planning purposes. That's been moved back.</li>
