<h3>Description</h3>

Currentrly I'm working with one app that will have a playlist, and so I would like to keep it playing on background and I though I would be able to use these controls.

I think would be really nice to have this feature native from appcelerator, so we would not need to use a module for this feature, wich I think is part of basic iOS features.


Module that does this: <a href="https://marketplace.appcelerator.com/apps/5573?651090353" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://marketplace.appcelerator.com/apps/5573?651090353</a>
