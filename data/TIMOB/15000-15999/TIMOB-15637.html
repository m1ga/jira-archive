<h3>Description</h3>

It would be great to have the ability to disable text selection in a TextArea that is both non-editable and not enabled (i.e., functioning as a Label), so we can take advantage of autoLink (a feature not available on the Label control for iOS), yet not allow the user to copy text from it. 

This would be useful in a messaging system scenario (see image attachment), or when text with varying and mixed link types (emails, urls, phone #'s, dates, etc.) need to be displayed.

   Hello,
   
   I created an issue *AC-6071* that @Sharif AbuDarda resolved and asked me to comment on this ticket.
   
   Desription is,
   
   I've a requirement to disable copy and paste in textFields and textAreas in my application. But I came to know that Appcelerator does not provide this functionality. Moreover, I could not find a native module to do so.
   
   I believe, this is a very important and useful functionality in terms of security.
   
   Please have a look.
   
   Thank you.</li>
</ol>
