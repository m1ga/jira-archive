<h3>Description</h3>

Mozilla browsers (Firefox and Firefox OS) are handling XMLHttpRequests differently from other browsers tested as working (Safari, Chrome). XMLHttpRequests processed via Firefox are sent as a preflighted request with a method of OPTIONS. This causes a failed response from the server in use for the particular project I am working on.

CORS has been setup on the server providing the data feed.

I have been able to get a valid response by commenting out lines 12-23 of SDK/mobileweb/titanium/Ti/Network/HTTPClient.js (this._handles = [...]), forcing a plain/text Content-Type, and removing all custom headers from the request. However this results in no onLoad and therefore can only be observed via a web debugging proxy.

I have discovered this while developing an app for the new Firefox OS, so a fix for this would be pertinent in making Titanium a viable choice for developers looking to build apps for Firefox OS.
