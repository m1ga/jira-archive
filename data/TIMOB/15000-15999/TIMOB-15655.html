<h3>Description</h3>

The "iphone" folder in the Resources folder is a relic of a time when iOS and iPhone were synonymous. Now there's obviously more than one iOS device and "iphone" is no longer really an appropriate name for the folder. It would make more sense for this folder to be called "ios".

Given the fact that there's all kinds of compatibility issues with changing this name, I suggest that for a period of time both folder names are supported and that they do the exact same thing. "iphone" should be deprecated, and "ios" promoted as the folder of choice though. After the appropriate amount of time has passed, remove "iphone" completely.

   This has been in there since 3.0.0.GA. Give it a go.</li>

   Haha, fantastic. Was it announced anywhere? Are we planning to deprecate "iphone"?</li>

   No announcement. When I wrote the iOS build, I had intended on renaming "iphone" to "ios", so I jumped through hoops to make the two names interchangeable. We'll deprecate "iphone" in Ti.next. You can pretty much use "ios" everywhere. The folders "Resources/ios" and "platform/ios". You can specify --platform ios. You can also say <module platform="ios">mymodule</module> in the tiapp.xml. The only places where we force "iphone" is the build dir and the platform dir in the sdk (and thus "iphone" in the manifest which drives builds.appcelerator.com).</li>
