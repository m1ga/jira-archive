   It would be nice if Appc had a backup registry mirror, yes.</li>
<li>Chris Barber 2013-11-05

   Maybe this is a good reason for Appc to roll out their own package management system?</li>

   Registry should be up now: <a href="http://stats.pingdom.com/d50hxzpzk7x4/650599" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://stats.pingdom.com/d50hxzpzk7x4/650599</a></li>

   I think that this ticket should be renamed to "Cannot install Ti CLI **when** NPM registry is down", reopened, and reevaluated. Both my and Chris's suggestions would be a great solution. Marking that the third-party website is now back up wasn't really the spirit of this ticket :)</li>
<li>Shannon Hicks 2013-11-05

   The sum of my reasoning is this... If installing the titanium toolkit is dependent on a 3rd-party service for which Appcelerator has no SLA, it probably isn't the best situation.</li>
<li>Ingo Muschenetz 2013-11-05

   That's fair. I believed there was another ticket that captured that idea which is why I resolved this. Instead, I've reopened this and moved it to a feature.</li>
