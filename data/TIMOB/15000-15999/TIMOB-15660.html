<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Description:</h4>
1.Update your CLI to a new version.
2.Run command "ti -v"

<h4>Actual Result:</h4>
1. You will see that you will still see the old version of the CLI.
2. Trying updating multiple does not help.
3. "sudo npm uninstall", "sudo npm cache clean" & install of CLI also does not work.
4. You have to get rid of <code><pre>"/usr/local/lib/node_modules/titanium"</pre></code> & from here <code><pre>"/usr/local/bin"</pre></code> as a workaround & possible from this location too <code><pre>"/Users/--username--/.npm/titanium"</pre></code>. 

<h4>Expected Result:</h4>
1. We should see the new updated version after updating.

   What version of Node.js? What version of npm? What command did you run to install the module? Did you use titanium@<version>?</li>
<li>Lokesh Choudhary 2013-11-05

   Node Version : v0.10.13
   NPM Version : 1.3.2
   Yes ran the command : sudo npm install -g titanium@<version></li>

   This may be related to our QE workflow. Meaning things seem to be ok with npm until you need to step back a version (for regression verification) and then try to move forward again. Since a later version appears in the cache, this might be part of the cause. In some cases, our normal "1) uninstall 2) npm cache clean 3) reinstall" did not work and required hand-removing all components and nuking the .npm folder.</li>

   I've been testing this over the past few months and have yet to see this issue since. I suspect it was a bug in an older version of npm. I usually keep my npm version to a current version.</li>

   Closing ticket as the issue cannot be reproduced.</li>
