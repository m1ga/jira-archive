<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Issue description</h4>
The methods in app.js are being ran once in the sample application. The issue is that app.js is being run every time the Application is being brought to the foreground on Kindle. This does not happen on non-Kindle Android devices.

When running the application on a kindle Fire HD, app.js is ran every time the application is brought to the foreground.

<h4>Steps to reproduce</h4>
To reproduce the APK application is referenced below. 

This was not reproducible by using a Simpler Project (Default Titanium app created into Studio IDE).

1) Install & Launch app (via URL provided below)
2) Wait until load
3) Quit via Home button
4) Attempt to open once again - app may or not resume execution as per following test results:

<h4>Test results</h4>
Once we get to the log in screen, the app will load into it on restart, most of the time. Very rarely, we get an all black screen. If we rotate the device, the screen changes to an _AppC loading screen_ e.g. Screenshot_2013-11-27-09-11-44.png

One pic is the loading screen we see before rotating to get to the log in screen. The other is of the AppC load screen he sees after rotating the black screen.

I am also including logs of first run of application, closing, and then reopening. According to the logs App.js is still being ran twice (Kindle_reopen.log).

   I just tried this with a first generation Kindle fire version 6.3.2 and I was unable to reproduce this.  I put a log statement in the app.js, and it only runs once.  Everytime I background the app, and come back, I don't see the log message inside app.js.</li>

   [~ayeung],
   
   mFoundry have to reopen this report. They are no longer able to work around the issue by installing the application via the browser instead of adb.
   
   Updated report details and added further information like test results and links to APK.
   
   If I can help any other way, let me know.</li>

   Closing ticket as it is not our bug.</li>
