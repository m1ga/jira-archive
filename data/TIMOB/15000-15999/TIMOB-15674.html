   Also, it would be nice to allow Alloy XML binding with sections.
   
   plus, this is not iOS only, Android too
   
   thanks</li>

   also, what about the ability to setData of only part of the data? imagine I have updates to the live listview, but only two rows changed out of 200, I am now forced to update all 200 of them? very expensive</li>
