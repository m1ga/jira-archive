<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>problem</h4>

As it stands now, the only output from the Android emulator launching process is the name of the emulator it intends to launch. There's no indication as to how it reached the decision to use a particular AVD. There's no output, positive or negative from the launching of the emulator. This means if there is an error in launching the emulator, the developer will have no idea why. This is further compounded by the fact that because the emulator process never gets started that "adb logcat" will provide no information either.

<h4>expected</h4>

The Android emulator output from the CLI should be like any other output, particularly on failures. It should contain full and complete log information that can be throttled using the CLI's log level options.

   To test, you need to cause your emulator to fail to load. How? Great question! I have no idea. I modified the code to run a non-existent emulator (line 234 of node_modules/titanium-sdk/lib/emulators/avd.js).</li>
