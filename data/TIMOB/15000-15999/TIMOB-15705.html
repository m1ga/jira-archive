   This is related to the terminal shell installed and used by Studio. Need investigation.

   [~rtlechuga] We will take a look at it in the next sprint for 3.2.0.

   When I started investigating the problem, I assumed the error is cropping up from Windows, or bash shell environment used by Studio due to incorrect PATH being set.
   
   However, as I investigated this one, this error turns out to be coming from CLI itself. While it parses the input args and commands, it assumes the process attached to titanium command is only 'node', and does not consider the windows process 'node.exe'. Though it tries to slice the 1st arg (node) process, since Windows has the complete path (C:\Program Files\NodeJS\node.exe), it fails to slice it and then, it fails as it could not find titanium as a valid command.
   
   The fix should be to consider node.exe (slicing the last 8 chars) as a valid process along with node. However, looking at the latest 3_1_X code, the fix is already in place to handle the case for 'node.exe'.
   
   [~cbarber] - please add if you have any inputs for this.</li>

   Resolving as Fixed., as the latest CLI 3_1_X looks already fixed this issue.</li>

   Verified fixed on:
   Windows 7
   Appcelerator Studio, build: 3.2.0.201311140721
   Titanium SDK, build: 3.2.0.v20131113183932
   CLI: 3.2.0
   Alloy: 1.3.0
   
   Titanium commands work in Studio terminal.</li>
