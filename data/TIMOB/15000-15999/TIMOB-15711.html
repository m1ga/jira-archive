<h3>Description</h3>

*Details:* On Mavericks, installing an app to a 6.X iOS devices will fail with signing issues.

Some things to note:
1. We were not able to reproduce the issue on Mountain Lion
2. We were not able to reproduce the issue on a 7.X iOS device
3. The iOS certs and provisioning profiles that we used are in a valid state 
4. [~oromero] repeated the below reproducible steps 18 times and she was able to install the app successfully *once* to a 6.X iOS device (see installed_on_device.txt); 94.44% error rate.

*Steps to reproduce:*
1. Create a default project from Studio

2. Next, from terminal, cd to the project and install the app straight to an iOS device using the following CLI command:
<code><pre>
"/usr/local/bin/titanium" "--no-colors" "--no-progress-bars" "--no-prompt" "build" "--platform" "iphone" "--sdk" "3.2.0.v20131113135506" "--log-level" "trace" "--target" "device" "--ios-version" "7.0.3" "--developer-name" "QE Department (C64864TF2L)" "--device-id” "1695e43b6a2ef79a8ab6ce90d6ff78f313500671" "--pp-uuid" "98F73243-B6CA-4F18-A4A6-64ED9096038C”
</pre></code>

*Actual:*  One of the following two errors would appear:

<code><pre>
[ERROR] ** BUILD FAILED **
[ERROR] The following build commands failed:
[ERROR]         CodeSign build/Debug-iphoneos/dolche.app
[ERROR] (1 failure)

// see build_failed.txt
</pre></code>

OR

<code><pre>
[INFO]  Installing app on device: 4s Sprint iOS 6
[ERROR] Failed to install app on device (0xe8008017)
[ERROR] Chances are there is a signing issue with your provisiing profile or the generated app is not compatible with your device
[INFO]  Project built successfully in 12s 50ms

// see failed_on_device.txt
</pre></code>

3. Do a *ti clean* on the project
4. And repeat steps 2-3 

*Expected:* Should be able to install to a 6.X iOS device without any issues.

   This is not a rare occurring thing. I've seen this error many times before. This isn't tied to Mavericks nor, 6.x devices. If you Google the hexadecimal error code 0xe8008017, you'll see there are many causes of this error. Based on my experience, I find it to be either based on provisioning profile issues or min ios version is too high.
   
   If an app is not building, if you redo the provisioning profiles, resync with itunes, and pray, it generally will work again.
   
   I have been told that using the full app id for the provisioning profile (instead of * wildcard) will help in this situation, but I'm not certain.
   
   I recommend resolving this as "Not Our Bug".</li>
