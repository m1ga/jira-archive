<h3>Description</h3>

we are having a number of challenges in certain complex IT environment that use SOCKS, HTTP Proxies, blocked outbound websites, etc.  

we need to add something either to setup or info (or maybe a specific command?) that will perform a series of tests to attempt to reach our systems.  it would be good as well to have this also dump out any whitelisted IP / hostnames we depend on so that an administrator could easily give that to their NetOps people.  (this would suggested by a customer recently).  This would include not only the CLI but Titanium SDK and Studio, etc.

we should hit NPM, api.appcelerator.net, Tistudio update service, etc with a test request and validate that we can use those services correctly in the environment the CLI is running.
