(this would suggested by a customer recently).  This would include not only the CLI but Titanium SDK and Studio, etc.\r\n\r\nwe should hit NPM, api.appcelerator.net, Tistudio update service, etc with a test request and validate that we can use those services correctly in the environment the CLI is running.\r\n ",
