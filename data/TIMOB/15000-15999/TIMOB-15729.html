<h3>Description</h3>

Larger iOS apps fail to install to device.

Here are the steps I used to reproduce this issue:
1. Create a new titanium project
2. Add the /Library/Desktop Pictures directory into the Resources/iphone directory  (copy the directory twice if it's doesn't repro the issue)
3. Install to the app to device: ti build -p ios -T device

Expected Result:
Device fails to install on xcode
Actual Result:
The app fails to install 

Notes: 
The threshold seems to be around 200MB.
I get this error in xcode: _select_socket: receive secure message timeout!

Installing the large apps seems to hang on iTunes deployment as well.

   Unable to repro with:
   Mac OS 10.8.5
   Xcode 5.0.2
   CLI: 3.2.0-alpha
   Alloy: 1.3.0-alpha
   Titanium SDK version  3.2.0.v20131117001643
   Titanium Studio, build: 3.2.0.201311160316
   
   Tried a single copy of desktop pictures, unable to repro.
   Tried a second ~ 188 MB - unable to repro.
   Tried a third - 277.5 mb - unable to repro.</li>

   Reopening because this doesn't seem to work from CLI alone. Continuing investigation.

   And then the app shows up. Apologies. 
   
   Worked directly to device from CLI with:
   ti build -p ios -T device -C e9299833f5b603d06e1b974a656bd79421304dcf
   
   Trying the basic command shown above:
   ti build -p ios -T device
   
   I got a build placed in iTunes, and this installed via sync with no issue.</li>
