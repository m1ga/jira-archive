<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Description</h4>
Creating an Android project and running it on a Kindle Fire works through Studio. When the project is packaged to an apk file then it errors out and displays that kindle certificates haven't been found.

I have attached a Linux script that will take the Studio apk file and sign it for the kindle. Then you only have to install the apk to the device with "adb install /path/to/app.apk".
It requires certain files to run the script. The script will tell you what you need to install.

<h4>Steps To Reproduce</h4>
1. Create an package an android application
2. Install the application on an Android device
3. Install the application on a Kindle Fire

<h4>Expected Result</h4>
2. Android device should have the app installed
3. Kindle Fire should have the same app installed

<h4>Actual Result</h4>
2. Android device has the app installed
3. Kindle Fire errors out saying it has no certificates.

+Extra Information+
The attached script has a specific format but very simple to use.

1. Move the apk you want signing into the "place-apk-here-for-signing" folder.
2. Run the script, don't clear out any folders if asked.
3. Run the 15th command to sign the application
4. Inside the "place-apk-here-for-signing" folder will be a signed.apk
5. Use ADB to install this new apk to Kindle

   Is this all Kindle Fires or just a specific version?</li>
<li>Samuel Dowse 2013-12-02

   Created and packaged an Android application called Example.apk through Titanium Studio
   
   <code><pre>SDowseMBP:Android sdowse$ adb install Example.apk

   	pkg: /data/local/tmp/Example.apk

   This is a Mavericks only issue.</li>

   Dupe of TIMOB-15817</li>
<li>Neeraj Gupta 2013-12-03

   [~sdowse] This ticket is marked as a dup of TIMOB-15817 but that ticket is marked as "cannot reproduce". Can you please confirm that both of these tickets work with you after you recreate the store?</li>
<li>Samuel Dowse 2013-12-03

   I have created a new keystore with a different name, password and alias to my previous keystore.
   Unfortunately the error still occurs for me.</li>

   So, Sam was able to perform this successfully on two other machines. I'm going to re-resolve as cannot reproduce, but we should figure out how to "fix" Sam's machine.</li>

   I completely removed all traces of Java from my machine.
   All Java folders, all oracle folders, even the Java internet plugin. Everything Java related wiped.
   I then installed Java from the following link: [Java SE 6, 1.6.0_65](<a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/dl1572)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://support.apple.com/kb/dl1572)</a>
   After this I created a new Android project, a new Android keystore and packaged it.
   
   Installing the application using ADB succeeded.
   
   <code><pre>
   SDowseMBP:~ sdowse$ adb install Documents/Android/KindleFire.apk
   5945 KB/s (8720922 bytes in 1.432s)
   	pkg: /data/local/tmp/KindleFire.apk
   Success
   </pre></code>
   
   
   +Extra Information+
   The files/folders I had to delete:
   
   /System/Library/Java
   /Library/Java
   /Library/Application Support/Oracle
   /Library/Internet Plug-Ins/JavaAppletPlugin.plugin</li>

   Closing ticket as the issue cannot be reproduced and due to the above comments.</li>
