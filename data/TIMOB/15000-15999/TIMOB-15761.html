<h3>Description</h3>

If you set the accuracy of Ti.Geolocation to ACCURACY_BEST or ACCURACY_HIGH before adding an eventlistener to Ti.Geolocation, the accuracy is actually set to 
ACCURACY_THREE_KILOMETERS.

It is caused because ACCURACY_BEST and ACCURACY_HIGH have the value of -1 and there is a check for accuracy not being -1 (because in the past it could only be 0 or greater?) in GeolocationModule.m

The workaround is to set ACCURACY_BEST or ACCURACY_HIGH again after adding an eventlistener, but it took us 3 weeks to find this. Either document this in the docs or change this behavior, but I can not believe this is intended.

SDK: 3.2.0.v20131010124846

GeolocationModule.m - line 284:
<code><pre>
-(CLLocationManager*)locationManager
{
	[lock lock];
	if (locationManager==nil)
	{
		RELEASE_TO_NIL(tempManager);
		locationManager = [[CLLocationManager alloc] init];
		locationManager.delegate = self;
		if (!trackSignificantLocationChange) {
            if (accuracy!=-1)
            {
                locationManager.desiredAccuracy = accuracy;
            }
            else
            {
                locationManager.desiredAccuracy = kCLLocationAccuracyThreeKilometers;
            }
            locationManager.distanceFilter = distance;
        }
</pre></code>
