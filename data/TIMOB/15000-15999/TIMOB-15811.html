<h3>Description</h3>

Animation on TabGroup is not working fine when orientation changed.
Steps to reproduce:

Scenario 1:

1. Install KS.Turn Device to orientation mode.
2. BaseUI>TabGroup>Animate Tab Group.
3. Again Tap on Animate Tab Group

Expected Result:
2. Proper animation must be shown.
3. Tab group window must open with all 6 options in landscape mode.

Actual Result:
2. Tab group animates as it should animate while on portrait mode then it again animates back changing its position as it should animate on landscape mode.
3. Tab group window opens up but in portrait mode and then switch back on landscape mode.

Scenario 2:
1. Install KS.Turn Device to orientation mode.
2. BaseUI>TabGroup>Close/Animate Tab Group.


Expected Result:
2. Proper animation must be shown.

Actual Result:
2. It turns to portrait mode then animate and then change back to landscape mode.

This is not a regression.
Occurs in 3.1.3.GA sdk also.

   This is due to the fact that the view that shows the tab changed value only supports Portrait orientation mode. This is KS bug. This bug should be reproducible in previous SDK's also. </li>

   Resolving ticket as Invalid as there is now a new version of Kitchen Sink available and we no longer support the version which relates to this ticket.</li>
