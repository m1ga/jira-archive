<h3>Description</h3>

CLI commands with missing arguments (should) display usage and help.

But when I do <code>ti sdk install</code> it hangs after the banner.

   I tried to reproduce this with Titanium CLI 3.2.0 and I cannot get it to hang.
   
   When you run "ti sdk install", the Titanium CLI will try to determine if there's a new stable Titanium SDK. This requires an Internet connection. If you do not have an Internet connection, it will say "[ERROR] No releases found!" which in itself is not quite accurate, but it is responsive.
   
   I could see if you have a bad Internet connection that it may appear to hang.
   
   @Fokke just out of curiosity, is this still happening?</li>

   Closing ticket as the issue cannot be reproduced and due to the above comments.</li>
