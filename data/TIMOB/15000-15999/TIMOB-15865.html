<h3>Description</h3>

mFoundry wants the ability to turn off the ability of gathering Geolocation analytics while still gathering the other analytics data that we gather.
Today it is an all or nothing.  An app can either have analytics turned on or turned off.  They cannot configure which parts of analytics to collect or not.

The application that mFoundry is talking about using mapping to find ATMs and bank locations.  So the app itself is already using geo events.  That means that if they turn on analytics, we will receive the geo analytic events.  

They want the ability, based on the project to have all analytics on/off or all analytics turned on except for geo events.
