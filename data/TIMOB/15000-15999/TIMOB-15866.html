   [~oromero] Can you confirm that the analytic payload is never sent? There will never be any console output related to analytics.</li>

   [~cbarber] We have a staging server set up to allow us to ssh in and check the events that are generated. 3.1.3.GA is generating events. 3.2.0 is not. Can you let us know what exactly you would like us to try to determine if the payload is being sent? We get nothing on the server, but can't verify that the payloads are or are not being sent.</li>

   [~emerriman] Not sure how that's possible. I don't think anything changed wrt analytics between 3.1.3.GA and 3.2.0 hence why I was asking if the analytics payload is even sent.
   
   What browser is being used to test this?</li>
