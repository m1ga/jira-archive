   [~oromero] What are the chances you had Titanium Studio or Appcelerator Studio running when you tested this?</li>

   [~ingo]Yes, regression against 3.1.3.GA, added to the description.
   
   [~cbarber] I did have Studio open. When tested against 3.1.3.GA I also had it running, but failed to log back in with an invalid authentication.
   You are right, Chris, exited Studio, logged out, tried to log back in, got the Error and status logged out. </li>

   This is not a CLI bug. Studio is constantly calling "ti status" to see if you're logged in. If you logout while Studio is running, it will kindly log you in again regardless of having logged out and tried to log back in using a bad password.</li>

   Talked to [~mxia], confirmed the expected new behavior. Closing this ticket.</li>
