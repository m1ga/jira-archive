   This is a native iOS behavior, but not available on Android. A workaround solution would be to do this in the context of a custom view, track click events, and then scroll to the appropriate spot.
   
   We may consider this in the future as a parity issue, but it would be in a release post 3.3.0.</li>

   Hi Ingo, have you seen this <a href="http://www.danielespinetti.it/2011/11/android-snippet-code-android-listview.html?" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.danielespinetti.it/2011/11/android-snippet-code-android-listview.html?</a> This doesn't need any "workaround" or does it?
   
   // I know, it is not the same as iOS has ,but on Android it's a standard. It would be great to have it. Custom views and all that stuff is another solution, but it will not work on 100% on all Android's resolutions. I think...</li>

   [~sko], I find it odd that you asked for this feature without any reference to the blog post that inspired it, yet you chose to take one of the images as an example of what the feature should look like.</li>

   Is this feature not natively available in Android? It looks like this creates an index: <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/SectionIndexer.html." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/SectionIndexer.html.</a> That has been around since Android 1.5 and is what is used by the linked example code from @Matej.
   
   Is there any idea on when this feature may be implemented?</li>
