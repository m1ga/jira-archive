   Hello,
   
   On 2.1.2.GA SDK we have same problem, when I try to pinch to zoom on WebView MAPs (I'm using leaflet javascript map engine) it doesn't work.
   We were going to release new app, but this issue was critical for us.
   
   Can you please, fix ASAP.
   
   Thank you.</li>

   Closing until the following info is provided: A reproducible test case; a simple app.js with a web view and a map will suffice, as long as it's reproducible. Is this only on Android, or iOS as well? If only on Android, we need to know the Android version, and whether it's on the device and/or simulator.
   Iasha: If you could do the same, that would be helpful.
   Thanks!</li>

   I tested this issue the test code below. I was able to reproduce the problem.
   
   <h4>Test Environment: </h4>
   
   OS: MAC OS X 10.8.5
   Ti SDK: 3.2.0.x
   Ti CLI: 3.3.0 
   Android SDK 2.3.3
   Android Device
   
   <h4>Test Code </h4>
   
   <code><pre>
   var win = Ti.UI.createWindow({
   	backgroundColor : '#fff',
   	exitOnClose : true,
   	fullscreen : false,
   	layout : 'vertical', 
   });
   
   var aWebView = Ti.UI.createWebView({
   	url : '<a href="http://openlayers.org/dev/examples/all-overlays-google.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://openlayers.org/dev/examples/all-overlays-google.html</a>'
   });
   aWebView.addEventListener('load', function(e) {
   	Ti.API.info('webview loaded: ' + e.url);
   });
   
   win.add(aWebView);
   
   win.open();
   
   </pre></code>
   
   <h4>Step to reproduces</h4>
   <h4>Create a new project </h4>
   <h4>Paste test code in app.js</h4>
   <h4>Now run on Android Device</h4>
   <h4>Now try pinch to zoom on WebView MAPs</h4>
   <h4>Check DDMS logs for getting warning </h4>
