   Please attach a sample app.js file, a screenshot of the issue, and confirm this is still a problem on SDK beta 3.2.0.</li>

   Where do I get 3.2.0 Beta?</li>

   Hi Laney,
   
   I cannot reproduce your issue with the latest version of the SDK. When I have an image with a capital letter and reference it with a lowercase letter, the image does not display (it is case sensitive).
   
   Have you updated your SDK version? If so, can you please verify if you are still seeing this issue?
   Thanks!</li>
<li>Laney Dale 2013-12-09

   Which version in particular are you referencing? </li>
<li>Eric Wieber 2013-12-09

   Laney,
   
   I tested on 3.2.0.v20131209110113 and 3.3.0.v20131209000849. In case you need the link again, you can get those builds from here: <a href="http://builds.appcelerator.com.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://builds.appcelerator.com.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html</a></li>

   Well I'd like to tell you but 3.2 breaks my navigation group so I can't get to the image. I can confirm it happens in 3.13GA</li>
<li>Laney Dale 2013-12-09

   Ok, I replaced the navgroup with a navwindow and even using the latest build I can get the image to load with the incorrect case. 
   
   Code for window (truncated to show only offending item)
   	var win = Titanium.UI.createWindow({
   		  title: 'Home',
   		  backgroundImage:'/images/background.jpg'
   		});
   code for nav
           var win1 = ld.ui.createHomeWindow();
   
   	var nav = Titanium.UI.iOS.createNavigationWindow({window:win1});
   	Ti.App.nav = nav;
   	nav.open();</li>

   Laney,
   
   After making a simpler test case, I finally was able to reproduce your issue.
   I am seeing the image on the simulator, but not on the device (when building for ad hoc).
   
   I'll make this ticket an official bug for further investigation. Thank you for your diligence and patience!</li>
<li>Alan Hutton 2020-01-09

    This issue is out of date with our current supported SDK release (7.5.2.GA as of the date of closure), and out of date with mobile OS versions. 
    
    If community members feel that the issue is still valid, please create a new ticket. Please reference this closed ticket number, include SDK used, comments, and code that demonstrates/reproduces the issue.</li>
