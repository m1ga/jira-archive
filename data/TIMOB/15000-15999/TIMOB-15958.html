<h3>Description</h3>

When you build an app using the ti.urbanairship module it won't work and complain the <code>AirshipConfig.plist</code> is missing, which is indeed not included in the final <code>.app</code> file. This might be a general problem with platform-folder files not being included, but this test case is specific to UA:

<h4>Steps to reproduce</h4>

1. Create new app: <code>ti create -p ios -n ua --id test.ua -d .</code>
2. Replace <code>app.js</code> by the module's example [app.js](<a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_modules/blob/master/urbanairship/mobile/ios/example/app.js)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_modules/blob/master/urbanairship/mobile/ios/example/app.js)</a>
3. Copy the module's example [platform](<a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_modules/tree/master/urbanairship/mobile/ios/example/platform)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_modules/tree/master/urbanairship/mobile/ios/example/platform)</a> folder to the root of the app.
4. Build the app to a device: <code>ti build -p ios -T device -C all</code>
5. Click the (on iOS7 poorly layed out) _Open UA Inbox_ button
6. Note that just before the app crashes because of a <code>NSRangeException</code> it alerts _The AirshipConfig.plist file is missing._ (screenshot A)
7. Go to the project's <code>build/iphone</code> folder and see that the <code>AirshipConfig.plist</code> file is there.
8. Open the <code>build/iphone/Debug-iphoneos/ua.app</code> package and see the file is *NOT* there!
9. Repeat steps 4-8 with 3.1.3.GA and see that the app now (still crashes, but) alerts the application key and secret are not set property, like expected. Also, you'll find that this time the <code>ua.app</code> package *does* have the file.

   The AirshipConfig.plist file is required by the UA module. It should be getting copied into the application bundle like other files in the platform folder.</li>
<li>Fokke Zandbergen 2013-12-11

   I know, and like I explain in step 7-9 the file is not packaged in 3.2.0</li>
<li>Jeff English 2013-12-11

   Agreed. Sorry that I wasn't clear. I was just clarifying the requirement for the ticket.</li>
<li>Ingo Muschenetz 2013-12-11

   Is this specific to the UA module? Does it happen with other modules as well? How about Android vs. iOS?</li>
<li>Fokke Zandbergen 2013-12-11

   [~ingo] I have no idea and I'm afraid I don't have time to test this today and probably not tomorrow either, but I just wanted to get this reported soon since it's quit critical if you ask me.</li>
<li>Ingo Muschenetz 2013-12-11

   Thanks. Just trying to narrow it down. [~emerriman], [~fcasali] any chance you guys can put a little color on this in the morning?</li>
<li>Fokke Zandbergen 2013-12-11

   Uh... this can't wait to 3.3.0, it's a blocker for any UA-push app.</li>
<li>Ingo Muschenetz 2013-12-11

   Fokke. merge-3.2.0. You're fine. Chris also thinks it's already fixed with a newer build. Can you try the latest SDK?</li>
<li>Chris Barber 2013-12-11

   I cannot reproduce. The AirshipConfig.plist file is present in my app.
   
   I believe this was fixed by TIMOB-15907.
   
   [~fokke] can you please try a new 3.2 CI build that was built after Dec 6th, 2013. To install the latest CI build, run:
   
   <code><pre>
   sudo ti sdk install -b 3_2_X -d
   </pre></code></li>
<li>Federico Casali 2013-12-11

    Can't reproduce also from my side.
    
    TiSDK 3.2.0.v20131210191510  
    CLI 3.2.0-beta
    UrbanAirship 1.3.2
    
    Tested on iOS 7 iPhone 5S and iOS 7 simulator. 
    </li>
<li>Federico Casali 2013-12-11

    @Fokke: let us know and reopen if you can still reproduce it after upgrading SDK and CLI to latest 3.2.X
    
    Closing.</li>
<li>Fokke Zandbergen 2013-12-12

    [~fcasali] yes, it works on the latest. Will update to master next time before reporting ;)</li>
