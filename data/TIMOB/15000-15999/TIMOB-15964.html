<h3>Description</h3>

I downloaded the latest Appcelerator Studio and launched it.
I got the Platform Configuration Wizard as soon as the Studio started which displayed Android Yet not configured.
Setting the Android SDK home path from the Preferences Window also did not seem to solve the problem.

Note:
I already had Android SDK installed and configured on my machine and it was working fine with the previous version of CLI: 3.2.0-cr1 for the same latest version of Appcelerator Studio, build: 3.2.0.201312101708.

Please observe the attached screen shot for more clarification.

Expected:
The Android configuration should be detected for the updated CLI: 3.2.0-cr2

   Shreya, could you attach the output of running "ti info -t android -o json" as well as "ti config" from the command line?
   
   Also, attaching a screenshot of Android preference page would be helpful.
   
   Thanks.

   Michael, I was unable to run the command you suggested. Below is its output on running on terminal,
   
   ti info -t android -o json
   FATAL ERROR: TypeError: undefined is not a function
   
   ti config
   FATAL ERROR: TypeError: undefined is not a function
   
   
   Also I am attaching the Android Preference window screen shot for more clarification.</li>

   Moving to TIMOB for Chris to take a look at since it appears to be a CLI issue.
