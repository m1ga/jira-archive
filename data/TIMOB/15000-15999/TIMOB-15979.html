<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Description</h4>
If I run LiveView on a project it will run successfully. However I swap to another project in the same workspace with LiveView still enabled it will run the first project again.

<h4>Steps To Reproduce</h4>
1. Create a default classic project
2. Turn on LiveView and run on iOS simulator
3. Create a default alloy project
4. With LiveView still enabled run on iOS simulator

<h4>Expected Result</h4>
The new project should be install and running on the simulator

<h4>Actual Result</h4>
The classic app will run instead of the alloy app.

   [~mxia] Can you verify? I am unable to reproduce.</li>

   [~mxia] This might be a studio issue since it does not seem to happen when called from the cli.</li>

   Hi Samuel, could you try with the latest Appcelerator Studio, which includes LiveView 1.0.1? I saw this issue before as well, but think it's due to an issue with looking into root app.js instead of platform-specific folder's app.js, and that has been fixed in the latest version. So far I have not seen the issue with the latest build.

   Just attempted with the latest LiveView 1.0.1. I have successfully managed to launch a classic application on device with LiveView enabled. I then created a new alloy application and launched it keeping LiveView enabled and the previous app still open on device.
   The alloy project opened successfully and LiveView is changing the device code as I work as expected.
   
   +Extra Information+
   In 'ti config' my paths.hooks was still linking to version 1.0.0 despite only having 1.0.1 installed. After manually changing that everything seems to be working as expected.</li>
