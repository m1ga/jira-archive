   The error came from running the python script in 3.1.3 SDK, so moving to TIMOB to investigate.

   Android tools upgraded to rev. 19, error started occurring.</li>
<li>Allen Yeung 2013-12-17

   [~egomez], I can't reproduce this issue.  Can you please try with the latest 3.2.0 Studio/CLI/SDK and let me know if that works for you?</li>
<li>Eduardo Gomez 2013-12-17

   [~ayeung], this error was reproduced on customer's environment, I've asked them to have a try. Is this fixed in the latest 3.2.0?</li>
<li>Allen Yeung 2013-12-17

   Most likely... 3.2.0 uses different build scripts all together.  Please let me know if they run into other issues.</li>
<li>Eduardo Gomez 2013-12-18

   This would be the output in 3.2.0:
   
   {quote}
   [WARN] :   --avd-* options have been deprecated, please use --device-id
   
   Available Emulators: 
       titanium_2_WVGA854 (2.3.3)
       titanium_8_WVGA854 (4.3)

   For help, run: titanium help build

<li>Allen Yeung 2013-12-18

   You need the latest everything for it to work.
   
   3.2.0 Studio
   3.2.0 CLI
   3.2.0 SDK</li>

    Could you use the latest CLI (3.2.0-cr3) and SDK from <a href="http://builds.appcelerator.com.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html?mobile_branch=master#3_2_X" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://builds.appcelerator.com.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html?mobile_branch=master#3_2_X</a> ?</li>
<li>Eric Wieber 2013-12-20

    After updating to 3.2.0-cr3, I get the same module error as above:
    
    {quote}
    [ERROR] : The module "mcdonalds.module.android.screen" does not support the ABI: "x86"
    [ERROR] : It only supports the following ABIs: armeabi, armeabi-v7a
    [ERROR] Application Installer abnormal process termination. Process exit value was 1
    {quote}</li>
<li>Allen Yeung 2013-12-20

    Did you upgrade the SDK as well? It should be fixed in the latest SDK.</li>
<li>Eric Wieber 2013-12-20

    Ah you're right, I was one behind. After getting SDK 3.2.0.v20131218160416, I was able to build and launch the app.</li>
<li>Neeraj Gupta 2014-01-06

    [~egomez] Let us know if this issue persists for the customer after upgrading to 3.2.0 GA release.</li>
<li>Eduardo Gomez 2014-01-06

    Thanks [~ngupta], 3.2.0 GA seems to have fixed the error building to android.</li>
<li>Neha Mittal 2014-01-21

    Verified fix with environment:
    
    Appcelerator Studio, build: 3.2.1.201401201818
    SDK build: 3.2.1.v20140117222448 and 3.2.0 GA
    acs@1.0.11
    alloy@1.3.1-beta2
    npm@1.3.2
    titanium@3.2.1
    titanium-code-processor@1.1.0
    Mac9(Maverick)
    Devices: Nexus 7(4.3) and emulator
    
    Hence closing the issue.</li>
