   Kam,
   
   I was unable to run the file attached as a project. Did you export the project to a file or did you just zip up the project folder? Try exporting it and reattaching. 
   
   Also you did not leave much indication as the the issue you would like addressed and how you want it fixed. Please provide some more information in the form of "problem", "steps to reproduce", "expected behavior", and "actual behavior". This allows for a much clearer understanding of the problem on both sides. For future reference:

   This is the project file. Just open the project in Studio and run it inside the browser. You will get the attached error screen message.</li>

   Hi Kam,
   
   The project file does not contain a tiapp.xml so it will not run in Studio. Can you confirm that in Studio, you went to File-> export -> Archive file -> then selected the proper project. This should result in the creation of a zipped up project. One needs this project in order to test the code. The Resources folder alone does not allow one to run a project either as the tiapp.xml is needed in order to run a project and it is located in the root node of a project folder, alongside Resources.
   
   Thank you,
   
   Carter</li>

   Hello Kam,
   
   I need you to follow the directions in the previous comment I left in order review the issue you are describing and run the code you have provided. Please export the entire project into one archived file, including the Resources folder, the tiapp.xml as well as the manifest, build.log files, LICENSE etc. Without all of the project resources in one project folder we cannot run the code you have provided.
   
   Thanks for your cooperation,
   
   Carter</li>

   Kam,
   
   There still seems to be a problem with the project you are exporting. Are you sure that you are including all necessary documents? In the chat2 zip you sent there was a build folder along with Resources, this should not occur. Please see the attached screenshots I took to show what you should be selecting when exporting a project. You must click the checkbox next to the name of the project and ensure that all necessary documents are checked, seen in the right hand window. Can you confirm that this is the process you are taking and that you see a similar set up of checked boxes? The Chat2 project you sent me cannot be run on Titanium, to check this for yourself just go to File-> import -> then select the project you have exported (chat2) and see if it will be recognized as a project by Titanium. It wont be because all the necessary files are not present. 
   
   Also, as I had stated in a previous comment: Please provide some more information in the form of "problem", "steps to reproduce", "expected behavior", and "actual behavior". This allows for a much clearer understanding of the problem on both sides. I cannot determine what exactly your issue is from the description you have given. Would you like for that error not to arise? As in what is your desired functionality and I will do my best to help you find a resolution. For future reference:

   Let's try this. Thank you Carter for your patience.</li>
<li>Kam Rezvani 2013-06-04

   Carter, just run the attached project inside a browser and you will encounter the error.</li>
<li>Carter Lathrop 2013-06-04

   Thanks Kam,
   
   I got the project to run but you still have not answered my question as to how this is a platform or Ti SDK bug. Would you mind providing some insight as to why this error is a platform bug? This seems to be an issue with your own code. Also the code is very long in order to be considered a test case please read:

   On what constitutes a test case and how to create a clear and concise bug report.

   I cannot trace this bug to the TI Javascript source code. When the source code compiles into HTML5, it generates this error. Therefore the TI SDK engine that creates the HTML5 code is not producing functional code.</li>

    Carter, apparently debugging mobile web apps are somewhat different than other platforms which is what I am used to developing in. Here is a useful link that I found online:
    
    <a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#</a>!/guide/Mobile_Web_Debugging_and_Testing_Tools
    
    Let me look into this further myself. I apologize for not being well informed on this.</li>
<li>Kam Rezvani 2013-06-04

    Carter, I attempted to debug this code using the instructions in the Mobile_Web_Debugging_and_Testing_Tools link. I was able to trace the error to an internal TI library Buffer.js located in the /titanium/Ti/ of the build directory. This is a Javascript library provided with TI to be used in compiling the source code into HTML5 and I am not able to debug it further.</li>

    Moving this to engineering as we can reproduce the error with Ti.createBuffer API.</li>
