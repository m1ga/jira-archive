<h3>Description</h3>

Hi,
I am trying to select a date from datePicker and display the same on a label that is on a tableViewRow. But In Android I am facing two issues:
1) minDate property of datePicker is not working on Android.
2) text Property of the label is not getting updated after selecting the value from date Picker(in Android).

Working fine in Iphone.

Attached is the sample code that I am using to perform the above operations.

The above issue is not happening in Titanium SDK 3.0.0 but giving issue on SDK 3.1.3

Thanks
Pankaj

   I can reproduce the issue with the attached test case and 3.1.3 SDK 
   
   1) where the selected date is displayed correctly on iOS simulator but not on Android simulator. 
   2) Another issue I noticed was that I could not select the date on Android simulator by spinning the picker as it rolls back to the original value.
   
   This issue was reported by "Pankaj Goyal" from the community but moving the ticket from TC to ALLOY project changed the reporter to me so I would appreciate if you can change the reporter back to "Pankaj Goyal".</li>
