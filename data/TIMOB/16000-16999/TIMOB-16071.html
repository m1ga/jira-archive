<h3>Description</h3>

Currently, if we need to implement a Table View containing footer, header and a data section with round corners borders we need to:
1 - Create regular views to hold the header and footer
2 - Create a Table View to hold only the data section and set its borderRadius property.
3 - Create a Scroll View to hold the header, the data section (a Table View) and the footer.

According to Titanium documentation, the layout containing a Table View inside a Scroll View is strongly discouraged: (<a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#</a>!/api/Titanium.UI.TableView - Section Tables and Scroll Views)

This ticket is intended to raise a discussion about the possibility to implement the support for data section border radius for Android (this behavior can already be achieved for iOS through the combination of the properties "borderRadius" and "style: Titanium.UI.iPhone.TableViewStyle.GROUPED").

Attached is a screenshot from a POC written in Android native code showing an Android's ListView containing a header (the Android image), a footer (the two buttons) and a round border data section in the middle. It's important to highlight that the only element used to compose this screen was a ListView (there were no need to use a Scroll View for example).

If you'd like to check the code of the screen attached, please let me know so I can upload it to the ticket.

Regards
Athila

   Thanks for your suggestion. Moving this enhancement request to engineering for further evaluation.</li>

   Does this functionality need to be added to TableView or could we add it to ListView instead?</li>
<li>Athila Santos 2014-01-16

   We need the rounder corner in the TableView. Adding it only to the ListView would bring to us a big effort to redesign our screens.
   If you want to implement in both components, we do not see any problem with that.</li>
<li>Ingo Muschenetz 2014-02-06

   This is non-native behavior so we will not be adding it to the SDK. However, there are simpler workarounds that can be pursued for those that wish this functionality, such as using a ScrollView with a vertical layout.</li>
