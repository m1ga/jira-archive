<h3>Description</h3>

If I call <code>selectItem</code> directly after adding a bunch of sections and items it won't work. I have to wait for the <code>postlayout</code> event.

It would be nice if this was handled internally.

   I am curious of the use case when it is advantageous to call selectItem method before the postlayout event as opposed to after the postlayout event. I would appreciate if you can explain a bit more.</li>

   It is simply a matter of convenience really. When I fill a ListView I and want to have a row pre-selected its inconvenient to add an eventlistener to wait for the postlayout event, specially because this event fires lots of time so I can't use a quick anonymous function but have to create a separate function and remove the eventlistener from as soon as it is called. It would make the code cleaner if I can call the method anytime and the API would just check if a row was preselected after finishing filling the ListView.</li>

   Makes sense. Moving this enhancement request to engineering for further evaluation and prioritization.</li>
