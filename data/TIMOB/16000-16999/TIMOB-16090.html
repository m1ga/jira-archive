   Was not able reproduce the issue i.e. was able to launch iOS simulators (iphone and ipad) from TiStudio and CLI for both Titanium classic and alloy projects.
   
   Tested on:
   
   Titanium Studio, build: 3.2.0.201312191547
   SDK build: 3.2.0.GA
   CLI: 3.2.0
   Xcode: 5.0.2
   Device: iphone simulator (7.0.3), ipad simulator (7.0.3)
   OS: Mavericks 10.9 and 10.9.1</li>

   any updates on this issue? this is greatly causing problems for our dev team. We have tried cleaning the project, and resetting the simulator content. Today we have tried deploying to the simulator (iPad then iPhone) 3 times each and the build has not been successful at all. we are forced to build to device only. we only have one which we share between dev and QA.</li>

   we are using Ti 3.2.0 xCode 5.0.2 and iOS simulator 7.0.3 and still experiencing this issue today.</li>

   possibly a helpful in debugging this problem, i am able to deploy to a 6.1 simulator, but not a 7.0.3 simulator.</li>

   We haven't yet been able to reproduce this problem in house which is causing some issues. There are reports of other non-Titanium suers running into this issue on Stack Overflow, and they have a variety of solutions, including changing the debugging protocol used. Have you tried anything else listed online beyond resetting the simulator?</li>

   On the QE team, we encounter simulator problems occasionally. The first few steps we take are designed to help us understand root cause. We start by taking the "Titanium-built" Xcode project and opening it using Xcode, then trying to build with the exact same simulator. If this fails, we use Xcode and try a new Xcode-created project and run in the exact same simulator. If this fails, we simply try to open the simulator from Xcode. We revisited this issue and using the same machine as originally reported, found that our iOS 6.1 simulator(s) had failed. Following the process above, here were the results:
   1) Titanium project would build, but would fail with the error as described in this ticket. Sim sits on black screen
   2) Tried opening project from Xcode, and launching in the same simulator. Same result
   3) Tried launching an "Xcode-created" project, same result
   4) Tried resetting the simulator, same result
   5) Removed the simulator via deletion of the simulator SDK (right-click and "show package contents" on Xcode): Xcode.app/contents/developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/SDKs/<THE ONE THAT DOESN'T WORK>
   
   You must then re-download the simulator with - Xcode menu>Preferences>Downloads>Components (Choose your simulator)
   
   While this has worked for us, this does not guarantee that this is the exact problem being faced by all. We do know this: We have seen single simulator failures not related to Titanium, and multi-simulator (like as above ALL 6.1 sims) failures not related to Titanium. We have seen the simulator reset fix the problem, and as above, sometimes requires complete removal of the simulator.
   
   What concerns me here is that it is mentioned that the simulator is working outside titanium. If the EXACT simulator is being used and failing only from Titanium then we need to continue to investigate because it seems to be a different issue in that case.

   This issue was previously scheduled to be worked on in more than one sprint:
   * 'Release 3.0.1' (on board 'Customer Issues')
   * 'Release 3.1.2' (on board '3.1.X Triage')
   * 'Release 3.0.1/TS 3.0.2' (on board '3.1.0 Triage')
   * 'Investigate' (on board '3.2.X Triage')
   
   Starting from JIRA Agile 6.3, an issue can only belong to a single future sprint. Read more about this change: <a href="http://docs.atlassian.com/agile/docs-0630/Sprint+Marker+Migration" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.atlassian.com/agile/docs-0630/Sprint+Marker+Migration</a>
   
   This issue is now scheduled for future sprint 'Release 3.1.2' (on board '3.1.X Triage').
   
   If this is incorrect, please update the issue accordingly.

   I cannot reproduce this using Titanium SDK 5.4.0.GA, 5.5.0.RC, or master (6.1.0) along with Xcode 7.3.1 and Xcode 8 beta 6. I'm going to say this is no longer an issue.
   
   Nowadays we use <code>simctl</code> to launch the iOS Simulator and install apps to it. We no longer use the <code>iossim</code> tool which relied on private frameworks.</li>
