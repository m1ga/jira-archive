					"body": "On the QE team, we encounter simulator problems occasionally. The first few steps we take are designed to help us understand root cause. We start by taking the \"Titanium-built\" Xcode project and opening it using Xcode, then trying to build with the exact same simulator. If this fails, we use Xcode and try a new Xcode-created project and run in the exact same simulator. If this fails, we simply try to open the simulator from Xcode. We revisited this issue and using the same machine as originally reported, found that our iOS 6.1 simulator(s) had failed. Following the process above, here were the results:\n1) Titanium project would build, but would fail with the error as described in this ticket. Sim sits on black screen\n2) Tried opening project from Xcode, and launching in the same simulator. Same result\n3) Tried launching an \"Xcode-created\" project, same result\n4) Tried resetting the simulator, same result\n5) Removed the simulator via deletion of the simulator SDK (right-click and \"show package contents\" on Xcode): Xcode.app/contents/developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/SDKs/<THE ONE THAT DOESN'T WORK>\n\nYou must then re-download the simulator with - Xcode menu>Preferences>Downloads>Components (Choose your simulator)\n\nWhile this has worked for us, this does not guarantee that this is the exact problem being faced by all. We do know this: We have seen single simulator failures not related to Titanium, and multi-simulator (like as above ALL 6.1 sims) failures not related to Titanium. We have seen the simulator reset fix the problem, and as above, sometimes requires complete removal of the simulator.\n\nWhat concerns me here is that it is mentioned that the simulator is working outside titanium. If the EXACT simulator is being used and failing only from Titanium then we need to continue to investigate because it seems to be a different issue in that case. \n",
