					"body": "Can you elaborate on the background mode for iOS please? If by that you mean that you have a view visible over the playing video (song in your case), then that is only possible on iOS. From the docs for the android video player: \n\nOn Android, the video player cannot switch modes. To create a fullscreen player, you must specify fullscreen: true when you create the player. This fullscreen player creates its own Android Activity on top of the activity stack. Unlike a normal view, this fullscreen video player appears as soon as it is created. The user can close the player by pressing the Back button. See the code examples for a sample using the fullscreen player on Android.\n\nThe same activity will not be possible on android because of the way the video player is put on top of the activity stack, nothing else is able to be run on top of it while it is playing. \n\nSorry for the inconvenience but this is a limitation on the android OS, not on Titanium. If you have any other questions feel free to ask.\n\nRegards,\nCarter ",
