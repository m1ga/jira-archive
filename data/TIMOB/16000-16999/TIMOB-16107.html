<h3>Description</h3>

In TIMOB-6273 the decision was made that a Ti.Database should be considered as Offline data and should therefore be installed in "Private Documents" by default.

Offline data will not be synced to the iCloud and (not sure of this part) will therefore not be backed up at all?

IMHO in a normal database app (and app where the users enter data which is stored in an sqlite db and where those users consider that entered data the single most important part about the app) the database should be labeled as Critical data and should therefore be placed a folder which is backed up in the iCloud cause the users would want it to be backed up as much as possible.

Could there be an option to let the developer decide this?

   Reopening this request and moving it to engineering for further evaluation and prioritization. 
   
   This request was created originally based on the comment from engineering team as part of ticket TIMOB-6273. This ticket indicates that you can get a file object from Ti.Database.DB and set the remote backup property on that file and that kind of works around the problem.
   
   But according to iOS Data Storage Guidelines:
   1. Only documents and other data that is user-generated, or that cannot otherwise be recreated by your application, should be stored in the <Application_Home>/Documents directory and will be automatically backed up by iCloud.
   
   This enhancement request is about the ability to indicate that Ti.Database is user generated and needs to be synced up and backed up. Stephen Tramer from engineering team validated and asked this enhancement request to be created.</li>
