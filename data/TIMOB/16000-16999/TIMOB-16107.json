					"body": "Reopening this request and moving it to engineering for further evaluation and prioritization. \r\n\r\nThis request was created originally based on the comment from engineering team as part of ticket TIMOB-6273. This ticket indicates that you can get a file object from Ti.Database.DB and set the remote backup property on that file and that kind of works around the problem.\r\n\r\nBut according to iOS Data Storage Guidelines:\r\n1. Only documents and other data that is user-generated, or that cannot otherwise be recreated by your application, should be stored in the <Application_Home>/Documents directory and will be automatically backed up by iCloud.\r\n\r\nThis enhancement request is about the ability to indicate that Ti.Database is user generated and needs to be synced up and backed up. Stephen Tramer from engineering team validated and asked this enhancement request to be created.",
