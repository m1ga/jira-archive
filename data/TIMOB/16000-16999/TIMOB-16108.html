<h3>Description</h3>

There are several support libraries to enable Action Bar-like UIs on pre-Honeycomb releases, including the popular ActionBarSherlock. This is important since Gingerbread is still the most popular Android release, and will be around for quite some time to come. We need such a library to enable high quality and fast development for all popular Android versions. Any thoughts on this?
Thanks

   Hi Mark,
   
   Thanks for your suggestion, though this sounds like a UI component that should be offered through a module. The Titanium SDK is primarily used to mirror the SDKs from the iOS and Android platforms and modules are used to add extra features. Since this would be an extra feature (something not supported in the Native Android SDK) then this should be something accomplished through a module. If you have any more questions or comments on the matter please feel free to ask.
   
   Thank you,
   Carter

   Reopening this feature request and moving it to engineering for further evaluation and prioritization as Android platform supports Action Bar functionality for API level 7 and above. 
   
   Action Bar is becoming more and more important for Android applications so it is worth considering this feature request.

   "The ActionBar APIs were first added in Android 3.0 (API level 11) but they are also available in the Support Library for compatibility with Android 2.1 (API level 7) and above."
