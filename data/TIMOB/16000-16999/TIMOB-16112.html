<h3>Description</h3>

Hi guys, I build an app that allow the user to take a camera photo and then save it on file system and then enter the path to the image in my DB. what i notice is that every picture that i take make the application bigger in the same size that the image weight.
I have set the image location folder to /SDcard/ i assume that this will solve the problem but it's not.
An application with few records on DB and 4~5 images now taking 25MB.
How can i solve that ? Thanks !

How can i tell the app not to consider the pictures size as part of app data size ?
