   I am a little surprised that you are trying to launch the Android simulator but the error message is related to Xcode. Can you please confirm that you are launching the Android but seeing this error message? It would help us to troubleshoot the issue if you can run this command and attach the output to this ticket.
   
   titanium info -o json</li>
<li>Phani Chaitanya Vempaty 2013-12-26

   Ritu,
   
   Yes, even I'm surprised as why it needs Xcode for android simulator. I've attached the output of the command you asked.</li>
<li>Ritu Agrawal 2013-12-26

   Thanks for providing the information so quickly. We will now try to troubleshoot the issue in house based on the provided information.</li>
<li>Phani Chaitanya Vempaty 2013-12-28

   Ritu, are you able to reproduce the issue ?</li>
<li>Chris Barber 2013-12-28

   The Android build (for apps) does not depend on Xcode or the Xcode command line tools.
   
   What is the exact build command you are trying to run?</li>
<li>Phani Chaitanya Vempaty 2013-12-28

   All I'm doing is "Run as Android Emulator" in the Titanium SDK.
   
   I'm also surprised as to why I get that error regarding Xcode as for Android it need not be required.</li>

   A quick update:
   
   I even tried to build from command line using the command : titanium build -p android -b -f --log-level debug -d test/
   
   I tried to debug the code and I found that the command (build) loading is failing. In the file "lib/cli.js" & line number 350, we call a function load as "command.load(<params>)" whereas command is build command in this case.
   
   I'm stuck at that place as I could not find where that piece of code is which executes the load. I tried searching in the build.js file (/Library/Application Support/Titanium/mobilesdk/osx/3.2.0.GA/cli/commands/build.js), but I cannot find the trace of the function in it.</li>

   The same command does work in other Mac OS X versions as in 10.9</li>
<li>Ritu Agrawal 2014-01-05

   [~pvempaty] Is it possible that your 10.9 machine has Xcode command line tools installed? CLI behavior should be identical for these two OS so trying to understand the difference in these two environments. </li>
<li>Phani Chaitanya Vempaty 2014-01-06

    Yes, it has command line tools installed.</li>
<li>Ritu Agrawal 2014-01-06

    Can you try installing the same command line tools on the other machines where you are running into this issue? It would help us narrow down the issue further.</li>
<li>Chris Barber 2014-01-06

    Confirmed and fixed issue.

    Closing ticket as fixed. After moving Xcode to a different directory, verified I was able to launch the android emulators; moving Xcode to a different directory simulated Xcode not being installed or xcode-select not pointing to the correct Xcode directory.
    
    Tested on:
    
    Appcelerator Studio, build: 3.2.1.201401061716
    SDK build: 3.2.1.v20140106195644, 3.3.0.v20140106195650
    CLI: 3.2.1-beta
    Alloy: 1.3.1-beta2
    OS: Mavericks 10.9.1, 10.9.2 (pre-release)
    Devices: android emulator 2.3.3, android emulator 4.2.2</li>

    Reopening ticket to rename the title to properly reflect the bug behavior.</li>
