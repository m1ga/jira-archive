<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Problem Description</h4>
The user needs to search in SQLite for a string like ängs, his SQLite contains the word Ängs, which should be a match, since he used LIKE. In the iOS simulator, he gets 0 rows as result. 


<h4>Workaround </h4>
Right now we requested him to search for ängs and Ängs in order to find the matches. 

<h4>Extra info</h4>
From this item:

<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10356062/how-to-deal-with-accented-characters-in-ios-sqlite" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10356062/how-to-deal-with-accented-characters-in-ios-sqlite</a>

appears that the LIKE function can be overwritten in order to support upper/lower case queries in non ASCII chars.

   This is not native functionality, so moving to a feature request.
   
   From what I understand, we would implement option #2 from the top answer in the StackOverflow post, and effectively allow for a new "unaccented" SQL function users could take advantage of. Is that correct?</li>
