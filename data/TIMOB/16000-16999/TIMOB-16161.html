   Is this ticket stating that liveview fails on device and emulator/simulator?
   </li>
<li>Christian Sullivan 2014-01-16

   What version of liveview is this tested on ?
   </li>
<li>Priya Agarwal 2014-01-17

   Actually liveView server starts. Getting below message on console - 
   [LiveView] version 1.0.1
   [LiveView] File Server Started on Port 8324
   [LiveView] Event Server Started on Port 8323
   
   But if I change in the code (js file) and save then liveView does not relaunch the app with reflected code.</li>

   [~pagarwal] can you please attach your log output to the ticket so I may review it. Thanks</li>

   The environment shows 3.2.1 for CLI, so likely related to TIMOB-16231. Marking it fixed now TIMOB-16231 is addressed.

   Unable to verify this ticket. Hence Reopening the issue.
   Since the ticket was closed with reference to TIMOB-16231 and according to workaround mentioned in mail. 
   
   Need to removeÂ liveView hook from paths.hooks in ti config
   
   So have done the above changes. After the above change was able to successfully build the app and run.
   
   But as soon as I enabled LiveView and tried again,  
   build failed and again liveView hook path is getting added in paths.hooks in ti config</li>
<li>Michael Xia 2014-01-21

   [~pagarwal] We just pushed another Studio 3.2.1 that includes the latest LiveView fix. Could you try updating and verify if the issue still happens?
   
   Thanks.

   Could not verify this issue as LiveView is not working. Logged an issue TIMOB-16286</li>
<li>Michael Xia 2014-01-22

   Re-opening this ticket since I'm seeing the behavior with LiveView included in Studio 3.2.1.201401221450 + CLI 3.2.1 + SDK 3.2.1.v20140121132444. Attached the build log when run on a default two-tab alloy app.
   </li>
<li>Michael Xia 2014-01-23

    Both Studio 3.2.1 + CLI 3.2.1 + SDK 3.2.0 and Studio 3.2.1 + CLI 3.2.0 + SDK 3.2.0 work for LiveView. Attached the working build log.
