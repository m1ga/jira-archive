   I would appreciate if you can execute the following command and attach the output to this ticket and we would be happy to investigate it further.
   
   titanium info
   
   It is also possible that you may be missing the USB driver for this device. Please confirm that you have used the same device for development on this machine earlier.</li>
<li>jason hu 2014-01-08

   As what I mentioned, it all worked fine before 3.2 update, so my device has no issues, besides, this is a Mac, no need for drivers.
   Please see attached txt</li>
<li>Ritu Agrawal 2014-01-08

   Can you please run the following command and see if it detects the device : adb devices</li>
<li>jason hu 2014-01-08

   yes, it can always detect all my devices. I tried suggested dab kill-server/start-server  as well</li>
<li>Chris Barber 2014-01-10

   Please try running the following at the command line:
   
   {quote}
   adb kill-server
   
   adb devices
   
   ti info -t android
   {quote}
   
   If your device is listed in the "adb devices" output, then it's definitely connected.
   
   If it's connected, verify that the device is listed under the "Connected Android Devices" section of the "ti info" output. If it's not listed, then this can be caused by a number of things. Here's the most common that comes to mind:
   
   1. Double check that the "state" of the connected device is "device". If it's not, then your device may be prompting you asking something like "allow usb debugging?" Make sure you say OK on the device.
   
   2. If you have more than one Android SDK installed and you tell Titanium to use one, but you have the other Android SDK in your PATH. This will cause conflicts and mess things up.</li>

   thanks for the response. the command line can always detect my devices, my device was unlocked for debugging, since I have been using it for development for over 2 years; I only have android sdk installed; As I said, this all worked fine until I updated to 3.2 studio.</li>
<li>Chris Barber 2014-01-10

   [~jason919] Hmm, ok. I wonder if this is a OS X Mavericks specific thing. I need more time to test.
   
   What device are you trying to use? Maybe we have the same device that I can use to try and reproduce the problem.
   
   In the meantime, is there another device you can test with?</li>
<li>jason hu 2014-01-10

   I have tested galaxy s3, LG Optimus, Galaxy Note3, Nexus S, Atrix Moto, they all worked before 3.2, now they all can't be detected. BTW, I also tried to create a brand new user account and installed everything from scratch, and still didn't like it.</li>
<li>Ritu Agrawal 2014-01-12

   Moving this ticket to engineering for further diagnosis. </li>
<li>Ingo Muschenetz 2014-06-17

    [~jason919] We believe this would be resolved by upgrading to the latest versions of all the tools. Can you please upgrade to Studio 3.2.3, CLI 3.2.3 and SDK 3.2.3 and see if that fixes the issue?</li>
<li>Ingo Muschenetz 2014-08-26

    We're unable to proceed as we need more information. If you are able to provide us more guidance, we'd be happy to take a look.</li>
<li>jason hu 2014-08-26

    It was resolved in 3.3 and 3.4.
    
    thanks for looking into it.</li>
<li>Lee Morris 2017-03-23

    Closing ticket with reference to the above comment.</li>
