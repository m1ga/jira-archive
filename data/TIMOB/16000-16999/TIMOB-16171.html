<h3>Description</h3>

Titanium SDK is installed not in default location, it is in D:\SDKs\Titanium
This path is set in Studio: Window -> Preferences -> Studio -> Platforms
Trying to build Kitchen Sink sample containing facebook module I get error in Studio:

[ERROR] Application Installer abnormal process termination. Process exit value was 1

It says nothing, but building app in command line I get error:

[ERROR] Could not find all required Titanium Modules:
[ERROR]  id: facebook  version: latest platform: android  deploy-type: development

When I copied Titanium SDK to (default) path:
    C:\Users\Janusz\AppData\Roaming\Titanium
build was successful. I doesn't change the path in Studio, I leave it
    D:\SDKs\Titanium

During building app Titanium uses module and other things from D:\SDKs\Titanium, but in default location SDK must exist to start building - I thing during checking if Titanium has all needed components to build.

   I have the same problem. This definitely need to be addressed.
   
   In the meantime, you can symlink the default directory to your custom location.
   This works great on OS X or Unix-like OS (using ln -s), but I believe you can create a NTFS junction (which is basically the same thing as a unix symlink) with mklink on Windows.

   There's also other type of link. You can try those as well.</li>

   Thanks for the workaround, it works fine. In my case I made symlink concretely using this command:
   
   mklink /d C:\Users\Janusz\AppData\Roaming\Titanium\ D:\SDKs\Titanium
   
   which SDK physically is in D:\SDKs\Titanium and the link is in C:\...\</li>

   To test:
   1. Create an Android app
   2. Enable a module such as ti.cloudpush
   3. Locate the folder where the Titanium SDKs are installed (C:\ProgramData\Titanium or ~/.titanium or ~/Library/Application Support/Titanium)
   4. Move the Titanium folder to the Desktop
   5. Run "ti sdk" to confirm no SDKs found
   6. Run "ti config paths.sdks /path/to/Desktop/Titanium"
   7. Build the app
   8. Should find the ti.cloudpush module in /path/to/Desktop/Titanium/modules/android/ti.cloudpush and build should work</li>

   verified as fixed for,
   Windows 7, 8.1
   Appcelerator Studio, build: 3.2.3.201403190645
   SDK :3.2.3.v20140324164913
   acs: 1.0.14
   alloy: 1.3.1
   titanium: 3.2.1
   code processor: 1.3.1
   
   Also I observed that the new Titanium path is not auto picked by Studio and so no Titanium is detected and Studio prompts to install the Titanium GA version. We have to manually reset it through Studio>> Windows>> Preferences>> Platforms.</li>
