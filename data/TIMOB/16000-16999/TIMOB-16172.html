   I am curious if there is a reason you are using Titanium SDK 3.0.2 with Studio 3.2.0. We recently released SDK 3.2.0 that includes many new features, enhancements, performance improvements and bug fixes and we would strongly recommend you to upgrade to the latest release. Please make sure that you have upgraded all components (Studio, SDK and CLI) to the 3.2.0 GA version.</li>

   Well, We are at end of product release and we tested and make it performance level in version 3.0.2 GA. It is not hard to upgrade to the latest version but it is hard to make upgrade at this stage. Is there any solution to this or alternate way to work with this ?</li>

   Another surprise is, it is perfectly working with iOS but getting problem in Android only.</li>

   Moving this ticket to engineering as I can reproduce this issue by building any sample project for Android emulator with Studio 3.2.0 and Titanium SDK 3.0.2.

   The Android build was completely rewritten for Titanium SDK 3.2.0. This is no longer an issue.</li>

   Closing ticket as fixed.</li>
