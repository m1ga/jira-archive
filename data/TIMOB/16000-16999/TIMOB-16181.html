<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Issue</h4>
When trying to build a project for iOS from within Appcelerator Studio, you consistently get an error stating that you require SDK 7.0.3 for iOS.

<h4>Problem</h4>
Proper version of Xcode is not getting detected

<h4>Validate</h4>
Make sure you have the latest version of Xcode (v 5.0.2)
- from the project root directory (E.G. ~/Users/yourusername/Appcelerator_Studio_Workspace/HelloWorld) run the following command line:

     titanium build --platform ios --ios-version 7.0.3 

  - you should see an error about locating a configuration file

<h4>Fix</h4>
force a redirection of Xcode by Titanium using the following command from terminal

     sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer

   Moving this to TIMOB since Studio relies on the CLI to return the right Xcode path. Also the fact that running the build command from command line produces an error indicates CLI is using the incorrect path.

   Attaching screenshot of the error about the config.json
   
   The archive was not in the directory but we were able to read the config using ti config command, we created an empty file in the correct path and then ti config failed, after that, we created a simple config.json file</li>

   This ticket is missing critical information such as the output from "ti info -t ios". Please include that in future.
   
   If Xcode is really located at /Applications/Xcode.app, then the CLI will find it.
   
   Regarding the screenshot, as the error indicates, the Titanium CLI config cannot be opened. This is most likely because you ran Titanium as sudo and now config.json is owned by root. To fix it, run: <code>sudo chown </code>whoami<code> ~/.titanium/config.json</code>.
   
   I'm resolving this as cannot reproduce. Feel free to re-open if a reproducible test case can be defined.</li>
