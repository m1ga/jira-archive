   This works fine on this end with the environment specifications.</li>

   Fails for me using Ti SDK 2.1.3.v20120927181611 and 3.0.0.v20121002103353, Xcode 4.5, iOS6, iPhone5 simulator</li>

   I just installed a new dev environment on a brand new machine - OS X 10.8.2 - Titanium SDK 2.1.3.GA - iOS6 - iPhone5 simulator and I appear to be unable to record audio in the same way as I have always done on another machine (with 5.1.1) 
   
   It appears to complain that it cant create the audio file. A zero size file is creatd in the simulator's app Documents folder though, where the audio should be created. 
   
   I'm getting : 
   
   Error : AudioFileCreateWithURL failed (-50)
   
   
   It appears I'm not alone with the urgent issue! (I got the new machine to be able to submit an app!)

   Just to add : This occurs on the simulator. It appears that on the device it's ok. </li>

   It seems that the simulator has trouble with the URL given to it having spaces and the URL needs to be escaped.   If you run the project directly from XCode, it defaults to using a different "temp url" for the recorded audio and that one has no spaces.  For me, that is: /var/folders/3q/vv7snyc13259jyb_795x2wmw0000gn/T as opposed to something like: "/Users/onlee/Library/Application Support/iPhone Simulator/" 
   
   I followed the fix outlined here: <a href="http://lists.apple.com/archives/coreaudio-api/2010/Aug/msg00210.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://lists.apple.com/archives/coreaudio-api/2010/Aug/msg00210.html</a> and it works now in the simulator and the -50 error code is gone.

   Hi Andrew,
   
   I was wondering if you adapted the fix for the URL you pass through JavaScript, or if you modified the native code? Is this something we could handle under the hood in Titanium?
   
   For now I've marked it as Fixed.
   
   Thanks!</li>

   Moving this to engineering for further evaluation and prioritization as we can reproduce this issue with the latest release.</li>

   Closing ticket as this version of Kitchen Sink is no longer supported.</li>
