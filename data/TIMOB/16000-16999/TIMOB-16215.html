<h3>Description</h3>

If you try to build an app that has an ampersand in the app name, then the build completes, but adb is unable to install the app to the emulator/device.

<code><pre>
[INFO]  Installing apk: /Users/chris/appc/workspace/testapp2/build/android/bin/testapp2 & blah.apk
[ERROR] Failed to install apk on "192.168.56.101:5555"
[ERROR] Error: INSTALL_FAILED_INVALID_URI
</pre></code>

The solution is to simply disallow ampersands in the app name. When creating a new app, only allow ampersands in the name if Android is NOT selected, however do show an warning.

   Verified the fix with test Environment:
   
   Appc Studio:3.2.3.201403250634
   Sdk:3.2.3.v20140325145222
   alloy:1.3.1
   titanium:3.2.3-dev
   titanium-code-processor:1.1.0
   Osx: Maverick(10.9.2)
   Device:LG-P970(V4.0.4),IpodToch2(v7.1)
   
   Steps followed to test:
   
   Scenario 1: Tried creating new classic and alloy app having "&" in project name example(android&test) and target as android.
   Result: As expected was not able to create Project having "&" in project name.
   
   Scenario 2: However Tried creating new classic and alloy app having "&" in project name example(android&test) and target as ios.
   Result: As expected was able to successfully create and install app on ios device having "&" in project name.
   
   Scenario 3: Edited tiapp.xml and added target as android also on the above created app and tried running it on android device.
   Result: As expected Got the expected error as:
   <code><pre>
   [ERROR] :  The app name "android&test" contains an ampersand (&) which will most likely cause problems.
   [ERROR] :  It is recommended that you define the app name using i18n strings.
   [ERROR] :  Refer to <a href="http://appcelerator.com/i18n-app-name" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://appcelerator.com/i18n-app-name</a> for more information.
   [ERROR] :  To allow ampersands in the app name, run:
   [ERROR] :  ti config android.allowAppNameAmpersands true
   [ERROR] Application Installer abnormal process termination. Process exit value was 1
   </pre></code>
   
   Scenario 4:Edited tiapp.xml and added target as android. Also added 
   "ti config android.allowAppNameAmpersands true" in CLI.
   Then tried running it on android device.
   Result: Build was successful with message give below as warnings but still was not able to install apk on android device as expected.
   <code><pre>
   [WARN] :   The app name "android&test" contains an ampersand (&) which will most likely cause problems.
   [WARN] :   It is recommended that you define the app name using i18n strings.
   [WARN] :   Refer to <a href="http://appcelerator.com/i18n-app-name" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://appcelerator.com/i18n-app-name</a> for more information.
   </pre></code>

   Another solution (if ampersand is not in the name), is to delete from the Android device (or simulator) the previously installed version.</li>
