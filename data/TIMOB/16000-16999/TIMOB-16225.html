<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>moved to timob</h4>

The below ticket originally came in as an ALOY ticket, and is still referenced as ALOY-822. The developer wants the ability to unset properties on a Titanium UI proxy. While I will be addressing the fact that <code>undefined</code> can't be used in TSS, the rest of the scope of the ticket is outside that of ALOY and needs to be handled at the platform level. 



<h4>Use case</h4>

I would like to be able to *un*set properties via TSS (and XML).

I want all windows to be heavyweight by default so my <code>app.tss</code> has:

<code><pre>
"Window": {
  modal: false
}
</pre></code>

But I have one widget which absolutely needs its window to be lightweight. Right now there is no way to do this. I can set <code>modal</code> to a different value like <code>true</code>, but even setting it to <code>null</code> won't make the window lightweight again.

I tried setting <code>modal</code> to <code>undefined</code> but it throws a syntax error:

<code><pre>
Expected "Alloy", "L", "Ti", "Titanium", "WPATH", "[", "false", "null", "true", "{", comment, end of line, number, string or whitespace but "u" found.
</pre></code>

<h4>Proposed solution</h4>

My suggestion is to accept <code>undefined</code> as a valid value, but instead of actually setting it, use it to trigger removing the property.

That way, for that specific window I can set <code>modal</code> to <code>undefined</code> which would remove that property from the dictionary passed to <code>Ti.UI.createWindow</code>.
