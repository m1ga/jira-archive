<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Steps to Reproduce</h4>
IOS latest, sdk 3.2.0 all updated etc
This is not an Alloy project
create a project with a navigationWindow
add several windows and the navigation works,
create a tabgroup,
in one of the tabs try to add a rightNavButton to the navigation controller
and navigate into it from another window.




<h4>Actual Result</h4>
no button is added.

<h4>Expected Result</h4>
buttons should be added to the NavigationBar
access to the navigation controller is now not possible from windows in a tab group
when it was before the change from Titanium.UI.iPhone.NavigationGroup to Titanium.UI.iOS.NavigationWindow
now we have to add a button for saving or adding in the window itself and that looks plain ugley especially when other native apps do it?!!?

   TabGroup and NavigationWindow are top level containers, which manage Ti.UI.Window objects. As such we expose NavigationBar management only on the Ti.UI.Window object.
   
   Although you can nest top level containers on iOS (NavigationGroup inside a TabGroup or vice-versa), this is not supported functionality. 
   Hence there is no way to manage appearance of the hosting NavigationBar (visibility, left/right buttons, barImages, translucency etc).
   
   The issue discussed here has been filed as a feature request TIMOB-16299
   
   Resolving this ticket as invalid since this is not a bug but expected behavior under current architecture.</li>
