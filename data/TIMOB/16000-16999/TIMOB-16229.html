<h3>Description</h3>

I've been getting lots of positive reactions to the launch of the [gitTio](<a href="http://gitt.io)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://gitt.io)</a> search engine and CLI package manager.

However, some people ran into problems after manually downloading and installing a distribution of a module available on GitHub, or using the [CLI](<a href="http://gitt.io/cli)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://gitt.io/cli)</a> to do this for them.

This problem occurs when these modules are also listed on the [Appcelerator Marketplace](<a href="http://marketplace.appcelerator.com)." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://marketplace.appcelerator.com).</a> When you download such a module straight from GitHub (or somewhere else), you will not be able to run an app using the module, because it will check with Marketplace if you have required the license.

<h4>Steps to reproduce</h4>

<h4>Create a new project: <code>ti create -p ios -n license --id test.license -d .</code></h4>
<h4>Do *NOT* _purchase_ the free [ZIP / UnZIP module](<a href="https://marketplace.appcelerator.com/apps/1355)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://marketplace.appcelerator.com/apps/1355)</a> from the Marketplace</h4>
<h4>Download the distribution [straight from GitHub](<a href="https://github.com/mpociot/titanium-mobile-zip-module/blob/master/dist/de.marcelpociot.zip-iphone-1.1.zip)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/mpociot/titanium-mobile-zip-module/blob/master/dist/de.marcelpociot.zip-iphone-1.1.zip)</a> and add the dependency (<code>&lt;module platform="iphone" version="1.1"&gt;de.marcelpociot.zip&lt;/module&gt;</code>) to <code>tiapp.xml</code> or simply use the [gitTio CLI](<a href="http://gitt.io/cli):" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://gitt.io/cli):</a> <code>gittio install -g de.marcelpociot.zip</code> in the project.</h4>
<h4>Build the project: <code>ti build - ios</code></h4>
<h4>Meet the beautiful red screen attached.</h4>

<h4>Solution</h4>
Of course this license verification is great for paid modules, but for free modules this makes no sense. I can imagine people like the stats they get about the usage of their modules, but this could still be tracked, while not raising the red screen at the same time.

I really urge you guys to consider this small modification. If the module is listed as *Free* on the marketplace, just track its usage, but *don't* trigger the red screen.

   From Matt Apperson I hear that when listing their module people can choose for _Open Source_ and then have people redirect to the GitHub repo (which would have the distributions) and the verification would not happen? That would in theory solve the problem, but then still wouldn't it be easier to (also) just skip it for any free listing?</li>
<li>Marcel Pociot 2014-01-17

   At the time I submitted my module (back in 2011) there was no "Open Source" category available in the marketplace.
   It's not possible to change the product type to "Open Source" once the module has been published.</li>
<li>Ingo Muschenetz 2014-01-20

   I believe this is actually a feature request that needs to be handled on the server side. I will create a linked ticket.</li>
<li>Timan Rebel 2014-02-18

   It is currently also impossible to use the 'Open Source' marked ti.Storekit module from the Marketplace. It redirects directly to Github and when I run the app with a development profile it throws the same Verification issue error.
   
   AdHoc works, but makes development much harder</li>
<li>Ingo Muschenetz 2014-02-18

   We have done the necessary work on the server side to fix this, but need to get that tested and deployed.</li>
<li>Timan Rebel 2014-02-18

   Thanks a lot! Any idea on the timeframe?</li>

   This is driving me crazy. I'm having to create new app UUID's all the time to get past licensing issues. Which of course makes it impossible to use: Analytics, and any kind of ACS functionality at all.  My app will be working fine for a couple of days, but if make an adjustment of the app ID for testing purposes, boom, i get the unlicensed nonsense again.
   
   Would it be possible to say which module is unlicensed? 
   
   <code><pre>
   License violation detected. Unlicensed module(s) detected.  You must be a subscriber to use one or more of the modules included with this project.. Please contact Appcelerator Support.
   </pre></code>
   
   Which module is the problem here? I'm using all open source or modules I've created. I need to know which one is the problem, so I can go back, change the ID, and recompile it.
   
   Also, what does "Please contact Appcelerator Support." even mean? As far as I can tell, there isn't a single contact number, email address, or support form for the Marketplace, or related licensing issues.

   [~andrew@gstreetmedia.com] The problem is that all modules free or paid are registered as paid modules in our backend database. This is a bug and we have escalated getting this fixed as soon as possible. This fix will only affect NEW free modules, not existing ones. We will need to figure out all of the free modules and fix the data in our database.</li>
<li>Chris Barber 2014-08-04

   [~andrew@gstreetmedia.com] To expedite this, what free modules are you using? We can check those and get you up and running ASAP.</li>
<li>Andrew Greenstreet 2014-08-04

    My manifest:
    
    <code><pre>
    &lt;module platform="iphone"&gt;com.gstreetmedia.aviarysdk&lt;/module&gt;&lt;!-- mine --&gt;
            &lt;module platform="iphone"&gt;com.findingrover.utils&lt;/module&gt;&lt;!-- mine --&gt;
            &lt;module platform="iphone"&gt;ti.styledlabel&lt;/module&gt;
            &lt;module platform="iphone"&gt;facebook&lt;/module&gt;
            &lt;module platform="iphone"&gt;ti.newrelic&lt;/module&gt;
            &lt;module platform="iphone"&gt;ti.mobileapptracker&lt;/module&gt;
            &lt;module platform="iphone"&gt;jp.msmc.gesturerecognizer&lt;/module&gt;
            &lt;module platform="iphone" version="1.0"&gt;de.marcelpociot.assetlibrary&lt;/module&gt;
            &lt;module platform="iphone"&gt;ti.map&lt;/module&gt;
            &lt;module platform="iphone"&gt;analytics.google&lt;/module&gt;
    </pre></code>
    
    I've tried taking these out one by one, but can't really seem to pin down which one is the problem.
    
    Thanks much for the assistance.

    This ticket has been open for months and months now and I hear lots of gitTio users complain about it. How hard can this be to fix anyway?
    
    <code><pre>
    if (module.free) return true;
    </pre></code>

    Can you change the licensing message to reflect the module that is actually throwing the error? Sometimes the only way I can get my project to work, is remove all the modules, and add them back one by one, compiling and testing each time. Is this happening to users of my app? I have no idea, why this keeps popping up for me or how to fix it because I have no idea what module is the problem. Frankly, I'm not even sure a specific module is the issue, rather just the use of modules period.</li>
<li>Chris Barber 2014-10-09

    [~andrew@gstreetmedia.com] I added this to the backend about 4 months ago and it just landed in production, unfortunately Titanium does not yet report these issues. I've created TIMOB-17834 and TIMOB-17835 to report modules that failed verification.
    
    In the meantime, you will need to comment out modules to figure out which ones are not passing verification.</li>
<li>Fokke Zandbergen 2014-10-10

    [~cbarber], so this ticket is resolved now? That would be great!</li>
<li>Chris Barber 2014-10-10

    [~fokke] Well, for brand new, never been downloaded by anyone, modules, yeah, it should be working. But for any existing free modules, we would need to manually flip a switch. :/</li>
<li>Fokke Zandbergen 2014-10-10

    Curious about how you implemented it if it only works for new modules, but flipping the switch on existig should be as simple as a SQL REPLACE right?</li>
