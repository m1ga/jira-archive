<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Problem</h4>

When date objects are sent as part of the object that is the argument of a global event (Ti.App.fireEvent()) they are modified so that the received date is not the same as the one that was sent.

<h4>Test case</h4>

<code><pre>
Ti.UI.createWindow().open();

var a = new Date(2014,1,15,1,2,3);

Ti.App.addEventListener("test", fn);

Ti.App.fireEvent("test", {
	Data: a
});

function fn(e) {
	alert("Expected: " + a.toString() + " What was received: " + e.Data.toString());
}


</pre></code>

<h4>Discussions</h4>

Run the test case above and you will see that obviously the date is changed during "transfer". (It does not seem to happen on Android). I guess there is something that differs between how objective-c and the javascript engine handles Date objects.
