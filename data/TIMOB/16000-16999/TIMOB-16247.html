<h3>Description</h3>

When building an iphone project (simulator, device or otherwise) using Any Titanium SDK < 3.2.0GA (3.1.3GA, 3.1.2GA, etc.) I get the following error:

[ERROR] :  Invalid "--ios-version" value "7.0.3"
   7.0
Accepted values:
   7.0
For help, run: titanium help build
[ERROR] :  Invalid "--sim-version" value "7.0.3"

When I attempt to modify my ios sdk in my build configurations, I am only presented with an option of 7.0.3.  HOWEVER, if I instead build from the command line using

titanium build -p ios -I 7.0

... then the project builds without issue (I can also build to a device and to the app store with the command line).  This only started occurring since my last upgrade of Titanium studio (to version 3.2.1.201401091648 on 1/12/14).  I have not updated my Xcode since November of last year.

   Moving this ticket to engineering as I can reproduce this issue as well on my machine. All of my projects that worked fine with 3.1.3 GA release and existing Xcode version stopped working after upgrading to 3.2.0 release. I had to change tiapp.xml file to use 3.2.0 release to make these projects build again. Note that I did not change or upgrade any component other than Titanium stack.</li>
