<h3>Description</h3>

When a hook passes back an error object in its <code>next()</code> call, it fails as expected, but there's no indication in the output about what actually caused the error. It would be very helpful to be able to see the content of the error that caused the failure, as well as any stack trace associated with it. If you don't want to dump the stack trace by default, adding a <code>--stack</code> option would be good.
