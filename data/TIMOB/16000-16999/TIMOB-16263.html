   While testing against master (3.3.0.v20140407144327), bug still seems reproducible *only* on a iOS 7.0 device (iphone 5s). 
   
   On 7.1 devices (iphone 4, ipad air), however, the bug seems fixed against master (3.3.0.v20140407144327).
   
   *Environment:*
   Appcelerator Studio, build: 3.2.3.201403271839

   While using SDK 3.3.0.v20140418162516, I am still able to reproduce this issue *only* on iphone 5s (7.0). I was *not able to reproduce* on iphone 5 (7.0.6) or ipad mini (7.1).
   
   *Tested on:*
   Appcelerator Studio, build: 3.2.3.201404162038
   SDK build: 3.3.0.v20140418162516 
   CLI: 3.2.3-beta2
   Alloy: 1.3.1 
   Xcode: 5.1.1
   Devices: iphone 5s (7.0)</li>

   I cannot reproduce this with our supported iOS versions (7.1 - 10.1), so knowing that it does not work in iOS 7.0.0 but does work on 7.0.1, I guess it was a temporary Apple issue that was fixed a few years ago. Thx!</li>

   Closing ticket as the issue cannot be reproduced.</li>
