   If it will be callbacks I'd be OK with it, no events please.</li>

   Fokke, what do you mean by callbacks but not events? Please verify. Thanks :)</li>

   Not sure if I wasn't feeling well on Jan 22nd, or if me being sick right now is the reason I really can't tell what I was trying to say. The activity events are will ever be events of course.
   
   I might not have read it well and tried to prevent stuff like Facebook login/logout which IMHO should really be handled with callbacks and not by events, but that's a different story.</li>
