<h3>Description</h3>

Once a build has been completed in the CI build, we need to run it though Anvil.

We wish to add a line below the CI builds to indicate the results of Anvil testing. As a suggestion, below each of the SDK builds, we should show the results at a very high-level

Since the testing is all done on OS X machines, we should probably indicate that in the results as perhaps in the future we could have more machines for more platforms;

For each test configuration, show a check or an X indicating if the test succeeded 100% or failed.

Hovering over the test shows the number of succeeded vs failed tests

Clicking on the test shows the test results.

   This has been completed. See <a href="http://builds.appcelerator.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://builds.appcelerator.com/</a></li>

   This is expected, since the releases tab was added later, and every build there is a build promoted from the CI builds (so it's already been tested).</li>

   Closing as implemented.</li>
