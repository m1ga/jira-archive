   I can get behind this. It is particularly useful with <code>build</code> since it has a mountain of options. That said, you can always run with <code>--no-prompt</code> and it will fail and give you the necessary flags/options.</li>

   Hmm, I don't hate it. :)
   
   Would it be better if after prompting is complete, then displaying a "Running titanium build -p <platform> ..." instead? Then someone can just copy and paste the entire command. Or maybe I could inject the final command into the bash history?</li>

   I think doing as the ticket states is great but also inserting the final command into bash history would be amazing</li>

   Having the full command displayed is nice as well, but not always practical if it is inmediately executed, rapidly pushing the displayed command up away in the console. I would like to have both ;)
   
   Using <code>--no-prompt</code> might be to harsh on people, having to retry for every command :S</li>

   Moving this ticket to engineering to evaluate and prioritize this improvement.</li>
