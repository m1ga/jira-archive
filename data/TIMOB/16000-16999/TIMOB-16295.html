   Bump - have also validated this on Ti SDK 3.1.3</li>
<li>Marko 2014-03-25

   Is this going to be fixed soon? Any workarounds?</li>

   Seeing this with 3.2.2.GA as well - this needs to get fixed as it is causing errors across simulators and devices that don't have external storage</li>

   In Android, external storage doesn't mean that it is removable media like SD card. As per the documentation "This directory can better be thought as media/shared storage. It is a filesystem that can hold a relatively large amount of data and that is shared across all applications (does not enforce permissions)". I think the behavior of this property is correct.
   
   If required, we should expose another property to check if the external storage is removable or not.</li>

   Closing as invalid. Reopen if you continue to have issues.</li>
