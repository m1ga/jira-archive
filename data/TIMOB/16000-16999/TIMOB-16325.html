<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Problem Description</h4>
Some users are having an issue when building ad-hoc distribution for iOS, with the message:

<code><pre>
[ERROR] :  Invalid "--pp-uuid" value "7C696B2E-FFBF-4017-BD16-843350656939"
</pre></code>

<h4>Steps to reproduce</h4>
Right now, we don't have a way to reproduce this. Looks like the only common issue is that they were using 3.1.3 and now 3.2.0.

<h4>Possible Workaround</h4>

A user is saying that the workaround is: Recreating the Run/Debug settings for the specific build choosing the correct provisioning profile solved the issue for me

   [~mpmiranda] Any word on how to reproduce this issue? I understand this is caused by building from Studio and not directly from Xcode.</li>
<li>Mauro Parra-Miranda 2014-01-30

   Hello Chris,
   
   not reproducible on my side. Yes, it's caused by building from Studio.
   
   Best,
   
   Mauro </li>
<li>Alex Bernier 2014-02-20

   On OSX 10.9.1, studio/CLI/SDK 3.2.1.GA and seeing this. Happy to help by providing more info.</li>
<li>Alex Bernier 2014-02-20

   Okay, this is no longer a problem for me. Here's what happened.
   
   I'm on a new machine. Hadn't had Xcode get all my profiles/certs/signing stuff yet. It had some, but the refresh didn't get all of them, so Titanium didn't see any certs.
   
   I would build in the above situation and see this bug.
   
   What I did to resolve it:
   <h4>Going back into Xcode, Accounts, and refreshing the details page (profiles, certs, signing, etc)</h4>
   <h4>Going back into Titanium, "Run Configurations," Application installer, the menus for choosing profiles updated, and now I can build fine.</h4>
   
   Happy to provide more detail on that.</li>

   still happening here, TiSDK 3.2.1, CLI 3.2.1, Titanium Studio 3.3.0. Xcode 5.0.2
   
   I have this problem when I try to Archive my project from Xcode. Publishing directly from Studio works fine.</li>
<li>Wang Xiao 2014-04-04

   I also had this issue.
   However, after I tried the followings, the App was archived and submitted to App store successfully:
   1. Under Project: 
       select "iPhone Distribution : ..." as Code Signing Identity.
       select Distribution Provisioning Profile
   
   2. Under Targets:
       use "iOS Developer" as Code Signing Identity
       use "None" as "Provisioning Profile"
   
   Not sure if it is a correct way. I also generated an Adhoc version to test in my phone. Seems ok.
   Now I am just waiting for Apple's Review.

   I could reproduce the issue, building for iOS device.
   The work around:
   Run configuration and delete all existing configs, try to build again. Works for me.
   
   The environment tested:
   Mac osx 10.9.4 Maverics
   Appcelerator Studio, build: 3.4.0.201409131030
   Titanium SDK, build: 3.4.0.v20140915084914
   acs@1.0.16
   alloy 1.5.0-rc2
   install@0.1.7
   npm@1.4.23
   sudo@1.0.3
   titanium 3.4.0-rc3
   titanium-code-processor@1.1.1
   Xcode6
   Device: iPhone 5S iOS8</li>
<li>Geoffrey Hoffman 2014-10-21

   This happened to me after using Ti Studio to try building an archive for then app store, then switching back awhile later to Run > iOS Device > my phone; Clean project did not fix it. Quitting Ti Studio, then reopening it, and cleaning and building again solved it.</li>
<li>Kiley Williams 2015-02-12

   This happened to me when I plugged-in a fresh iPhone 5C, went through the motions to set it up through iTunes and the device walk-through, and finally added it as a device on Apple's developer console. I downloaded and applied the development provisioning profile certificate, and then closed opened Titanium Studio. I went to build, and I ran into the error "Invalid "--pp-uuid" value ..."
   
   Once this happened, I was able to get it to run properly by going to "Run Configurations" (as mentioned above), selecting the device, and hitting "Run".
   
   Just wanted to share what happened to me recently in case anyone can benefit from it.</li>

    Hi All,
    I am also facing the same issue while trying to generate IPA with Xcode 6.3.
    
    So i just want to know is there any updates on this ticket?</li>
<li>Sean Snyder 2015-05-17

    Hi Chris
    
    any news on this--we're trying to update our new app version and we are stuck...any help would really appreciate if you can check it ASAP.
    Thanks in advance
    Sean</li>
<li>Chris Barber 2015-05-17

    [~supasnyder] Are you building from Studio? Are you doing an iOS ad-hoc distribution build? What Titanium SDK version are you using? What is your selected Titanium SDK? (run "ti sdk" from the terminal) What is the build output with TRACE level logging? (create a gist or pastebin and add a link to this ticket)</li>
<li>Sean Snyder 2015-05-17

    @Chris Barber, I will have @Silambarasan Raman reply back to your questions ASAP</li>
<li>Silambarasan Raman 2015-05-18

    Hi Chris Barber
    
    We are using To SDK 3.5.1 GA and building from Xcode 6.3.
    
    Yes we are using ad hoc distribution too..
    
    We were building the IPA file from Xcode and uploaded to app store previously. Now we are facing an issue while try to update the same app.
    
    PS: I have checked by regenerate the certificates too.
    
    Getting the below issue while generate build to app store
    <a href="https://developer.appcelerator.com/question/161067/trying-to-archive-for-ad-hoc-but-gets-error-i-xcode---developer-name----pp-uuid" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://developer.appcelerator.com/question/161067/trying-to-archive-for-ad-hoc-but-gets-error-i-xcode---developer-name----pp-uuid</a></li>

    So, here's the deal. When you open a generated Titanium app in Xcode, then build it, the Xcode project's pre-compile phase runs a Titanium iOS build which skips all Xcode related tasks and simply compiles the JavaScript, copies images, generated i18n files, etc. Xcode sets a bunch of environment variables when spawning the Titanium iOS build, however none of them indicate with certainty whether the app is being built for device, appstore, or ad-hoc distribution. We currently look at the CURRENT_ARCH to determine if the value is i386, then we know you're doing a simulator build, otherwise we default to device builds.
    
    Since there's no way to distinguish between dist and device builds, the Titanium iOS build assumes device builds. This which means that Xcode is essentially calling <code>ti build \-p ios \-T device</code> in which case <code>--pp-uuid</code> is required and hence the error message.
    
    There is no straightforward solution. We could hack something and look at one of the paths in the Xcode environment variables to try and determine a dist vs device build, but then how do we tell appstore from ad-hoc builds? Furthermore, if the Titanium iOS build is only compiling JS and copying images, why does it care what the target is? We just need the deploy type. This comes down to the Titanium iOS build not having first class support for building from Xcode. Could we fix it? Probably. Is it a priority? Unfortunately no.
    
    HOWEVER, I have a workaround! In Xcode, go to the project target you want to build (i.e. myapp-universal), then select "Build Phases". Expand the "Pre-Compile" phase. In the shell script, find the Titanium iOS build call and after the <code>\-\-xcode</code> flag, add <code>--target dist-adhoc --output-dir dist</code>. Then simply "archive" the app and you should be good to go. If you rebuild your Titanium app from Studio/CLI, then you'll need to change the pre-compile script again.</li>

    Hi Chris Barber,
    
      Thanks for your info, Its solved an error,  I have successfully update app to app store.
    </li>
<li>zee 2015-07-23

    hi i have updated the pre compile phase but the error is not gone .please guide</li>
<li>Chris Barber 2015-11-16

    In Titanium 5.0, we ripped out the Xcode pre-compile phase. This means we no longer build the app, then have Xcode call the Titanium CLI to copy files. By doing this, we sped up the build considerably at the cost of building directly from Xcode becoming more tricky.</li>

    am getting this error again
    </li>
<li>michael warnes 2017-05-07

    sdk 6.0.4GA</li>
<li>michael warnes 2017-05-07

    should you re-open this issue?</li>
<li>Chris Barber 2017-05-08

    [~mike@warnes.com] Are you building from Appcelerator Studio or directly from Xcode? Are you on the latest version of Studio? Are you sure your provisioning profile is a valid adhoc provisioning profile (not expired, tied to correct app id)?</li>
<li>michael warnes 2017-05-08

    yes I have the latest updates, and the project was previously building quite happily for about 18 months! I'm building from studio, but tried building from xcode in desperation! Have regenerated all provisioning profiles, and certificates. Deleted everthing from cache, tried adding profiles through xcode and studio, but always the same result. I can run the application in debug on the simulator and the iphone so totally stumped at the moment. Clearly this has been happening on and off over the last few years
