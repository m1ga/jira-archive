<h3>Description</h3>

Inside Studio we have an option to preview a MobileWeb app on an Android emulator. Unfortunately with the new CLI we have no command to tell it to launch the selected nAndroid emulator without also building the app for Android. In the meantime I can hack in basic support for launching on my own, but it'd be nice if there were a command to launch a given emulator for us.

   This ticket should probably be resolved as won't fix since TIMOB-10764 will add "run" support for mobile web projects and includes opening via an Android browser.</li>

   Closing ticket as Won't Fix with reference to the above comments.</li>
