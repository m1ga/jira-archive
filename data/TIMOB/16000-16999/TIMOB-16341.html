<h3>Description</h3>

During build time, the CLI excludes Ti Classes that are not found in the app's js code. This is problematic when a module uses a class that is not used in any js code. 

For example, the Brightcove module uses TiMediaVideoPlayerProxy class and it is necessary to have a line of code referencing <code>Ti.Media.createVideoPlayer</code> so that class will be included in the build (see MOD-1628).

It would be very helpful if we could define the classes that are used in a module and have the build process include those classes without having to reference them in the js.

   Hmm, isn't this what the metadata.json file is used for? Handling of the metadata.json file is not identical between iOS and Android, so we'd need to check if each are correct and if it solves your use case.</li>

   Sure is! How did I not know about this? Thanks [~cbarber]</li>
