<h3>Description</h3>

When a change triggers LiveView to reload the app, app events like <code>Ti.App.resumed</code> or <code>Ti.Gesture.orientationchange</code> are not cleaned up and fire for once each time the app has been reloaded.

<h4>To reproduce</h4>
Run the following app with LiveView enabled and follow the steps on the screen:

<code><pre>
var run = Ti.App.Properties.getInt('run', 0);
run++;
Ti.App.Properties.setInt('run', run);

function logEvent(e) {
	console.log(e.type + ' #' + run);
}

Ti.App.addEventListener('resumed', logEvent);
Ti.Gesture.addEventListener('orientationchange', logEvent);

var win = Ti.UI.createWindow({  
    backgroundColor:'#fff'
});

win.add(Ti.UI.createLabel({
	text: '1. Change something to trigger LiveView to restart the app.\n'
		+ '2. Move app to background and then resume.\n'
		+ '3. Change orientation.\n'
		+ '4. Check logs.\n'
		+ '5. Confirm that you see each event triggered twice.'
}));

win.open();
</pre></code>

   I tried the test case with LiveView enabled but for some reason I am not seeing any orientationchange or resumed event. It is a little strange as I see the same behavior with or without LiveView. I will try on another device tomorrow.</li>
<li>Fokke Zandbergen 2014-01-28

   Well, that would be very strange indeed. I did the test on iOSSimulator, using the menu options to rotate and shake the device.</li>

   Moving this ticket to engineering as I can reproduce this issue with Appcelerator Studio 3.2.0 and LiveView.</li>

   I think it's even wider then App events, it's any non-UI event listeners, also on custom modules. So it might even mean these modules are never cleared as well?</li>
<li>Fokke Zandbergen 2014-02-04

   Why backlog? IMHO this stops LiveView from being usable in any serious app using non-ui event listeners.</li>

   I'm having the same issue with Ti.App.fireEvent/addEventListener events and also with the facebook module's login/logout events. </li>

   I was hoping for a temporary workaround by detecting a reload from liveView but so far no succes. This issue makes liveView pretty useless</li>
<li>Fokke Zandbergen 2015-11-10

   The issue is complex because apart from core-APIs firing global events, there could also be modules.
   
   The workaround is:
   
   * Use the <code>close</code> event on Windows
   * You can check if LiveView is active with <code>if (localeStrings) ..</code></li>
<li>Mark Henderson 2018-02-20

   This seriously affects the ability to use LiveView on Android. Since the app is re-loaded effectively, can't all App.addEventListener and App.fireEvent's be reset?</li>
