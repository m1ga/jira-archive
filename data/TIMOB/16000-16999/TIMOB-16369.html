<h3>Description</h3>

Hi...

In webView when selecting the content or text a default popup menu gets appeared with the options copy, define, share etc.

Is it possible to remove this option without blocking webview text selection? Also, add some new menu option?


---

We should add a boolean property to disable the default set of context actions in the action bar. We may *also* want to allow disable text selection altogether.

<code><pre>
var webView = Ti.UI.createWebView({
    disableTextSelection: false,
    disableContextMenu: true
});
</pre></code>

   Moving this feature request to engineering for further evaluation and prioritization. There is a pull request from the reporter for this feature but it is most likely on the wrong branch.

   Any word on this? The ticket is nearly two years old.</li>
<li>Be Rushton 2016-04-26

   Might be time to start addressing some of these old tickets?</li>
<li>Jignesh Kasundra 2016-05-17

   is there any time frame on this ticket ? as the ticket is raised two year back. the contextual action bar is very important for the application.</li>

   [~jignesh.igp] Just want to check, this is the removal of the ability to copy in the webview? Do you have a image that can be shared to show what you mean?</li>

   How exactly would you use this? For [~jignesh.igp], I assume you would just like the ability to stop this?</li>
<li>Jignesh Kasundra 2016-05-20

    i need to stop that default contextual action bar which have options like copy , share etc. without blocking text selection.
    the contextual action bar (displayed on top in the image) get appeared on selecting text and i want to prevent that options ( copy , share etc)</li>
<li>Tim Poulsen (ACV) 2016-05-24

    I'm afraid I commented four months ago and I don't recall exactly what my needs were at the time. I think it was to put a "share-to-specific app" shortcut in that action bar in place of the defaults. </li>

    The Android Contextual ActionBar (CAB) is much more than copy-paste from a WebView, or adding a Sharing Action Provider (which is exposed on my ActionBarExtras Module).
    
    Here's a native library to expose the CAB that shows an use-case different than the aforementioned.</li>
<li>Ashraf Abu 2016-05-25

    So for now, the issue in this ticket would be [~jignesh.igp]'s issue on needing to stop/disable the CAB.</li>
<li>Jignesh Kasundra 2016-05-25

    yes i need to stop/disable the CAB.</li>
<li>Jignesh Kasundra 2016-06-02

    okay great. 
    
    i am also facing same issue with iOS platform as well. after selecting a text in webview it shows me copy , define , share options so that also i need to stop/disable.</li>

    Hello
    is that this ticket is under evaluation ?</li>
<li>Hans Knöchel 2016-07-12

    So for iOS, I guess [~jignesh.igp] means the popup that is shown when you select text. That is a native behavior and should not be prevented from the native-side. Instead, the user can/should change the HTML attributes that disable text-selection. See [this thread](<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/6051172/5537752)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://stackoverflow.com/a/6051172/5537752)</a> on how to insert a CSS-snippet in your webview-source and it should work. Otherwise, please specify what exactly needs to be specified.</li>
<li>Jignesh Kasundra 2016-07-27

    hello
    
    for iOS,
    the thread you suggested is also blocking the text selection. i need to disable only popup contextual menu which is appeared after selecting text. I know its iOS behavior but as i  shared a screen shot of one of the iOS reading application where they  hides the option like copy. (<a href="http://testaz3.azardi.com/issue/Reference.jpg)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://testaz3.azardi.com/issue/Reference.jpg)</a>  because the content we are rendering into webview is very valuable and need to prevent it from copy and share.
    
    for Android i think the engineering was done by Ashraf Abu and was planed to release the fix with the version 6.0.0</li>
<li>Hans Knöchel 2016-09-14

    I introduced the new property <code>disableSelection</code> to disable the text-selection and hide the callout-bubble when being set to <code>true</code> (default is still <code>false</code> for backwards-compatibility)

    Demo (local_webview.html is attached from the KitchenSink):
    <code><pre>
    var win = Ti.UI.createWindow();
    
    win.add(Ti.UI.createWebView({
        url: "examples/local_webview.html",
        disableSelection: true
    }));
    
    win.open();
    </pre></code></li>

    CR and FT passed. you can use url: "<a href="http://google.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://google.com</a>" instead. with disableSelection: true, you can try to press and hold any text, there will not be any pop up.
    </li>
<li>Ashraf Abu 2016-09-22

    [~cng] I believe this requires Android parity.</li>
<li>Chee Kiat Ng 2016-09-22

    [~fmerzadyan] can you take a look at implementing the android part?</li>
<li>Farzad Merzadyan 2016-09-26

    Just to clarify, do you want to remove all options in contextual action bar: copy, share, select all, web search and assist? I put a placeholder text and icon just for demonstration of what I have right now. [link screenshot](<a href="http://s21.postimg.org/ueyct6kpz/cab_screenshot.png)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://s21.postimg.org/ueyct6kpz/cab_screenshot.png)</a></li>
<li>Chee Kiat Ng 2016-09-28

    I think that's acceptable since it's a similar behavior in iOS.</li>
<li>Christopher Williams 2016-10-06

    Ok, so I've tried to bring a little sanity to this ticket/request:
    
    - This ticket should cover being able to disable the default context bar actions when selecting text on Android.
    - TIMOB-23992 is the equivalent ticket for iOS
    - TIMOB-23993 is the feature request that [~timpoulsen] seemed to be asking for, which is to not necessarily to disable the context actions, but to substitute/add custom items there.</li>
<li>Farzad Merzadyan 2016-10-11

    </li>
<li>Christopher Williams 2016-10-28

    Merged PR to master. Can now use the disableContentMenu boolean property to disable the default context action bar from showing (cut/copy/paste/share) when selecting text in a WebView.</li>
<li>Lokesh Choudhary 2016-12-01

    When <code>disableContextMenu</code> is set to <code>false</code> the context menu does not come up with SDK 6.1.0.

    Verified feature, when setting <code>disableContextMenu</code> to <code>true</code> the contextual bar is no longer present, setting <code>disableContextMenu</code> to <code>false</code> allows the contextual bar to be seen.
