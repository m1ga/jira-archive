<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Problem Description</h4>

Currently, the Android implementation of Titanium Mobile API, will hardcode the flags for the webview behavior like:

<code><pre>
settings.setSupportMultipleWindows(true);
settings.setJavaScriptCanOpenWindowsAutomatically(true);
</pre></code>

The user wants to be able to control those from within the JS level, in order to accomplish things like:

"I need to prevent the webview to open another window"

   Any news on this ticket? I too need the ability of running android web views in one window. Would be great if it could be included in the next release.</li>

   would you all accept a pull request for this one. 
   This is truly a trivial change.
   
   I would actually change the following lines  (188- 194) to accept a value but leave these current values if none are set. 
   
   The file in question is  android/modules/ui/src/ti/modules/titanium/ui/widget/webview/TiUIWebView again (lines 188-194):
   
   		settings.setUseWideViewPort(true);
   		settings.setJavaScriptEnabled(true);
   		settings.setSupportMultipleWindows(true);
   		settings.setJavaScriptCanOpenWindowsAutomatically(true);
   		settings.setLoadsImagesAutomatically(true);
   		settings.setDomStorageEnabled(true); // Required by some sites such as Twitter. This is in our iOS WebView too.
   		
   
   @Ron I don't work for Appcelerator and I give no warranty to what I'm about to say, but if you desperately need this in a pinch then build an android module that extracts this functionality out. If someone can point me to a good way to method intercept / swizzle, then I'd hazard a module for android.

   Hi Andrew,
   
   I actually always wondered what exactly a pull request is. I believe it is an outside contribution to the SDK right? If you could make it so I would gladly accept it.
   About creating a module for it, I thought about it, but I'm not so into java. OBJ-C no problem but I switched to Titanium to avoid having to code in java.
   I think all it takes is a function that accepts a webview, sets the values and returns the web view back to titanium. I'll see if I could cook that up somewhere in the next days.</li>

   Hi Andrew, 
   
   Would it be possible for you to still create this pull request?
   I would really have no idea where to start!</li>

   supportMultipleWindows in webview is exposed.
   
   I think to disable opening new windows, one can attach a handler to onCreateWindow and return null, something like
   
   webview.onCreateWindow = function() { return null;}

   Preventing opening new windows works ok if return null.
   If I want to open popup contents in the same webview (like iOS does), so I do like this:
   <code><pre>webView.onCreateWindow = function(e) {
           return webView;
   };</pre></code>
   
   But it crashes the app.
   
   
   Also if I try to run the snippet from <a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#</a>!/api/Titanium.UI.WebView-property-onCreateWindow, I get a blank webview in "New page" tab and in console manymany logs like this: 
   <code><pre>[INFO] I/TiWebChromeClient.console: (main) [196,277988] Uncaught ReferenceError: TiApp is not defined (1:null)</pre></code> </li>
</ol>
