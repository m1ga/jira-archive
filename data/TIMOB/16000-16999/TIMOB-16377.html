<h3>Description</h3>

There are times when adb stops seeing an Android device despite being connected. This can be fixed by restarting adb, however it can be confusing when the Android build says there are no Android devices connected.

To fix this, we need to scan all connected USB devices and identify all Android devices, then query "adb devices". If "adb devices" does not return all of the connected devices, then restart adb and try again.

To detect connected USB devices on Mac OS X run <code>system_profiler SPUSBDataType</code> and on Linux run <code>lsusb -v</code>.

   I haven't seen this in a long time. This just may have been a side effect of an old version of adb.
   
   In any case, I really don't want to do this ticket. It's a hack. We shouldn't have to querying the OS for connected USB devices to validate <code>adb devices</code> results.</li>
