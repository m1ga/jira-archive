<h3>Description</h3>

Since version 2, genymotion no longer ships with the Google APIs installed.  Users must manually install the Google APIs themselves.  The previous hack to check for the inclusion of Google APIs in a genymotion simulator that is not running no longer apply, and may, in the future, confuse those responsible for the maintenance of the cli.

genymotion.js, line 349
<code><pre>
// this is a hack, but by default new Genymotion emulators that have Google APIs will
// say "Google Apps" in the name, so if we find that, assume it has Google APIs
if (emu && /google apps/i.test(emu.name)) {
    emu.googleApis = true;
}
</pre></code>

   Moving this suggestion to engineering for further evaluation.</li>

   This was fixed in 3.4.0. We default to guessing if Google APIs are supported by checking the Genymotion emulator name. Then if the emulator is running, we connect to it and check the props to see if the Google APIs actually exist. In other words, we only know for sure if the emulator is running. Not much more we can do.</li>
