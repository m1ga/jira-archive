<h3>Description</h3>

When you open a new window from within a tab the open animation sort of animates in a jagged/shocking way. As if the animation is rendered using large blocks with a height of ~100pixels at a time. Even the root window's background color often shows in the bottom half of the screen.

I managed to capture the effect in a screenshot using the iPad Retina simulator.

You can reproduce the issue by creating the default Classic/Tabbed application template and opening the window. The effect is most obvious on a retina iPad in landscape.

This is the call that triggers the open with the default animation.
<code><pre>
self.containingTab.open(Ti.UI.createWindow({
  title: L('newWindow'),
  backgroundColor: 'white'
}));
</pre></code>

The issue has been in Ti SDK for as long as I know. I always thought I was doing something wrong, but I am not... So time to report the issue cause apparently no one else is seeing it...

   Thanks for reporting this issue. Just to make sure that I understand this issue, you are saying that default Class Tabbed application has poor animation. Are you making any change to this sample? If yes, can you please provide complete code?</li>
<li>Martijn Kooij 2014-02-12

   No, it happens in the default sample code as well. No modifications at all.</li>
<li>Ritu Agrawal 2014-02-13

   We cannot reproduce this issue at all. Would it be possible for you to provide a video to demonstrate the issue?</li>
<li>Martijn Kooij 2014-02-13

   I would say the screenshot shows it already, a video will only prove it a tiny bit more...
   It appears to be easier to see with higher resolutions + slower devices. It is barely visible on an iPhone for instance, but clearly visible on a retina iPad. So have you tried it on the iPad Retina simulator in landscape?
   
   The animation you see in the screenshot is the default slide from right to left. It appears to be animating in blocks of n pixels height causing large chunks to be somehow delayed a tiny bit?
   
   I will try to find some screencapturing software tonight, but I can hardly believe you can't see it whereas I can see it on both the simulator as on a standard iPad 3.</li>
<li>Martijn Kooij 2014-02-13

   I have attached a video showing the effect.</li>
<li>Martijn Kooij 2014-02-13

   The close animation is not that smooth either actually. Not as bad as the open animation, but still far from smooth. I have attached another video showing both opening and closing (still the default tabbed application template, no changes).
   
   Tried it on the last nightly SDK as well (20140210)</li>
<li>Ritu Agrawal 2014-02-14

   Thank you very much for providing the video. I can now reproduce the issue with iPad simulator.</li>
<li>Ritu Agrawal 2014-02-14

   Moving this ticket to engineering as I can reproduce this issue with "Tabbed Application" shipped with Studio.</li>
<li>Hans Kn√∂chel 2015-10-20

   Is that issue still present on latest Titanium SDK and iOS ?</li>
<li>Martijn Kooij 2015-10-20

    Was reproducible and still is...</li>
<li>Alan Hutton 2020-01-09

    This issue is out of date with our current supported SDK release (7.5.2.GA as of the date of closure), and out of date with mobile OS versions. 
    
    If community members feel that the issue is still valid, please create a new ticket. Please reference this closed ticket number, include SDK used, comments, and code that demonstrates/reproduces the issue.</li>
