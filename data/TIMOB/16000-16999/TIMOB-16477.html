   Regarding the section index overlapping the searchbar, we can not fix this issue (See TIMOB-666 for an explanation).
   
   Regarding the second issue raised here that the cancel button disappears when search ends, this is native behavior of the search controller (used with the searchView API). We can override this behavior by forcing the cancel button to show when search controller is no longer active but it has 2 problems
   
   1. The UI transition is glitchy
   2. The cancel button becomes interactable after the search bar blurs.
   
   Going to mark this issue as Wont Fix. Please use the searchText API in ListView in conjunction with the searchBar. A simple sample is included in TIMOB-16507</li>
