<h3>Description</h3>

The touchEnabled property set as false for a view does not work properly on windows phone8 whereas it works fine as a mobile web project.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Setup and run the attached project
2. Click on the red view
3. Click on the label text in the view (which is added onto the red view)

Actual Result:
The click event on the red view does not respond due to a transparent view over it which does not send the click event to the red view despite of its touchEnabled property set as false.
Click on the label text, which is added to the red view, responds to the click event. Also the click event for the red view gets fired when clicked on the label in it.

Expected Result:
The click event on the red view should fire when the view is clicked anywhere.
