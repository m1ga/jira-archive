<h3>Description</h3>

It seems that some PNG images 256-color depth (8bit) with transparency (chunk tRNS set with 1 entry) are not shown as annotation icon, i.e. the annotation is created and set in map (it displays the tooltip if tapped), but it is invisible. The same image converted to 16million colors depth (24bit) is displayed correctly. The same image kept at 256-color depth (8bit) with removed transparency (chunk tRNS removed from png) is displayed correctly (though, obviously, without transparency)

   RES_HIDDEN is 8bit (256 color depth) with transparency: when used for image property on annotation it results in an invisible annotation icon
   RES0 is 8bit (256 color depth) without transparency: when used for image property on annotation it results in a visible annotation icon (without transparency)
   RES6 is 24bit (16million color depth) with transparency: when used for image property on annotation it results in a visible annotation icon as expected</li>

   Thanks for providing the images. I would appreciate if you can provide a runnable test case so that we can try to reproduce the issue in-house.</li>

   Hi, the problem is present in this app for android <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=it.regione.lazio.luceverde" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=it.regione.lazio.luceverde</a> : when you expand (zoom) clustered annotations, you can see that some annotations are invisible (but tap-ping around the map will still show the annotation tooltip).
   Anyway, I will extract a simpler test case and source code tomorrow.</li>

   A simple test case using two annotations RES.png (RES_HIDDEN) and RES0.png</li>

   Hi,
   I've attached a simple test case (atest.zip) with map and two annotations, the first which will result to be 'invisible' and the second which will result to be visible. Tested on Android (google Nexus 5 device)</li>
<li>Ritu Agrawal 2014-02-25

   Moving this ticket to engineering as I can reproduce this issue on Nexus 5 device. Please use attached file ATest.zip file for a simple test case.</li>

   I just discovered that an underscore in the image name also causes the annotation to become invisible, e.g. pin_selected.png.
   Didn't tried your test case but maybe it's the same issue with your RES_HIDDEN.png</li>
<li>Alfredo Schiappa 2014-03-11

   No, in origin the image was named just RES.png
   I renamed it to make things more clear.</li>
<li>Rene Pot 2016-11-28

   I'm having the exact same issue. I can also provide test images where needed. 
   
   Is there any progress on this ticket?</li>
