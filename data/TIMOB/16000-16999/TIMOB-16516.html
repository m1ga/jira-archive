   I followed the exact same steps and was not able to reproduce the error.
   
   My environment ( Titanium SDK 3.2.1 GA + Studio 3.2.1 + CLI 3.2.1) is exactly the same as yours.
   
   Are you seeing this error consistently without modifying any code?</li>
<li>Mladen Mijatovic 2014-02-25

   I didn't modified any code from a default template. It doesn't show up every single time, rather randomly, when I swipe applications window from iOS multi-tasking tray view. Your iOS SDK is the same (7.0.3)?</li>
<li>Ritu Agrawal 2014-02-26

   my iOS SDK is same. Please narrow it down to a set of steps (even if random) so that we can reproduce it. We have not been able to reproduce it after multiple attempts.</li>

   Can I upload somewhere a short movie, recording my workspace when error has happened? (File is too large ~60Mb for ticket attach)
   
   Steps to reproduce:
   
   New -> Mobile App Project -> Project Template Classic -> Tabbed Application -> (Titanium SDK version 3.2.1.GA, Deployment Targets iPad+iPhone) -> Run As iPhone Retina 4inch -> Cmd + Shift + 2x’H’ and then from multitasking view swipe up application for shutting down.</li>

   Thank you for providing the detailed steps. I still cannot reproduce the error after multiple try outs. You can put the movie in dropbox and share the link with us.</li>

   Moving this ticket to engineering as this issue occurs intermittently with any project, including sample project. Please take a look at the video link above.</li>

   What is the status of this bug? Can it be solved in near future?
   
   Best regards,
   Mladen.</li>

   I see that you have reported this as an error, but what is the result? Does it cause a problem in any way?</li>
<li>Mladen Mijatovic 2014-03-06

    It could cause a problem when I submit application to AppStore. They are specific in the request that application can't crash.</li>
