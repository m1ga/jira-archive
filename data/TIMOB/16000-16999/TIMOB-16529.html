<h3>Description</h3>

Steps to reproduce are:
- create a new project in Appcelerator Studio with iOS as the target.
- build the project for simulator
= browse to build folder and open the xcode project in xcode.  
- run the project.  You will see around 40 warnings there.  Most can be corrected with modification to the output files, while others refer to deprecation. 

URGENCY:
- we need a clean version of the SDK that eliminates as many warnings as possible.  No warnings is preferred, but the rule for customer is under 10.  If some cannot be removed, we need explanation. 


Let me know if you have any questions
