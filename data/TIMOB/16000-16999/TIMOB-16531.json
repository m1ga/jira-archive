		"description": "Hello there,\r\n\r\nWhile doing development I have found some bugs related to Android 4.3 and earlier Support. Please see the screencast to get more details:  http://www.screencast.com/t/otYiOr6j.\r\n\r\nThere are three devices used when producing the screencast (from left to right): \r\n\r\n1. Android 4.4.2 and TiSDK 3.2.1.\r\n2. Android 4.1.1 and TiSDK 3.2.1\r\n3. Android 4.3 and TiSDK 3.1.3\r\nThe screen resolution of all enumerated devices is 1280x800 160dpi.\r\n\r\nAs it was mentioned above, the screencast shows the problems connected to Android 4.3 and earlier versions support. In the video you will see the so called “wheel” component. This component gets frozen after some time of being used on  Android 4.1.1 and TiSDK 3.2.1. \r\n\r\nAlso, the video demonstrates the general problem for Android 4.4.2 and Android 4.1.1, such as non-working rotate method of 2DMatrix class in the \"touchmove\" event (you will see switching done between the images for TiSDK3.2.1 without animation, while moving finger (mouse-pointer) on screen) and  wheel rotating to a random angle, after that the lost focus of the window with wheel is shown). Actually, TiSDK 3.1.3 is free from these bugs.\r\n\r\nMoreover, please note that  Android 4.4.2 and TiSDK 3.2.1 are working slower than Android 4.1.1 and TiSDK 3.2.1. This bug is more evident for TiSDK  3.1.3 and earlier.\r\n\r\nPlease see the demo app as an attachment. Feel free to ask additional questions.\r\n\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\n\r\nAndrey Ovcharenko\r\nVELVETECH, LLC\r\nwww.velvetech.com\r\n",
