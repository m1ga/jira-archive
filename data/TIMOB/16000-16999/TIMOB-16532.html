<h3>Description</h3>

Right now Facebook is its own module.  There is also ACS.  However, the configuration for ACS and things like twitter vs. facbook vs. Pintrest is disjointed and or incomplete.  At the same time, you have third party modules in the marketplace that attempt to consolidate these services and simplify them.  However, they are at an additional cost, not supported, usually not able to be tested, and come with varying degrees of documentation.  An all-in-one social module that consolidates all of those services and simply asks for your relevant credentials while hiding much of the complexity would add a lot of power to the community.  There are some examples of this in the marketplace - many of which could be improved.  I think it would be a huge addition to the Studio functionality in today's connected world.

   Moving this ticket to engineering for further evaluation and prioritization. iOS6 introduced Social Framework concept and may be useful in this context.
