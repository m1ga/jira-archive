   Our Mobile Web platform targets mobile browsers and is neither supported nor optimized for Desktop browsers. Given that MouseWheel functionality is specific to Desktop browsers, we do not plan to add this functionality.
   
   Thanks for your contributions.</li>

   That is NOT true. You already have the mouse wheel functionality in there for Safari, & Chrome, this patch just fixed it for Firefox and IE. 
   
   Please look at line 172 of your code and tell me what you see?

   I see:
   
   <code><pre>
   	// Handle mouse wheel scrolling
   enableMouseWheel && (this._disconnectMouseWheelEvent = on(self.domNode, "mousewheel",function(e) {
   if (self.scrollingEnabled) {
   self._cancelAnimations();
   var distanceX = contentContainer._measuredWidth - self._measuredWidth,
   distanceY = contentContainer._measuredHeight - self._measuredHeight,
   currentPositionX = -self._currentTranslationX,
   currentPositionY = -self._currentTranslationY;
   
   setMinTranslations();
   
   // Start the scrollbar
   self._startScrollBars({
   x: currentPositionX / distanceX,
   y: currentPositionY / distanceY
   },
   {
   x: self._measuredWidth / contentContainer._measuredWidth,
   y: self._measuredHeight / contentContainer._measuredHeight
   });
   
   // Set the scroll position
   self._setTranslation(Math.min(0, Math.max(self._minTranslationX,-currentPositionX + e.wheelDeltaX)),
   Math.min(0, Math.max(self._minTranslationY,-currentPositionY + e.wheelDeltaY)));
   
   clearTimeout(scrollbarTimeout);
   scrollbarTimeout = setTimeout(function(){
   self._endScrollBars();
   },500);
   
   self._handleMouseWheel && self._handleMouseWheel();
   }
   }));
   </pre></code>

   Reopening this ticket as we do support MouseWheel for Chrome and Safari, but not Firefox because they invented their own API a long time ago. While Appcelerator does NOT officially support desktop browsers including Firefox, it is recognized that desktop browsers are used for developing Mobile Web apps. Because of this, we would reevaluate this PR.</li>
<li>Andrew Greenstreet 2014-02-24

   Thanks. I'm not sure I could make it through development without firebug, and firebug is only available for Firefox. Incidentally, even though you don't "officially" support desktop, with the exception of a mousewheel, I can't really see what is different. 
   
   We are currently building the Android & Web (yes, web desktop) versions of FindingRover.com using Titanium (ios is currently native and on the app store). With the exception of bugs that exist across all browsers (mobile and desktop) we really haven't encountered anything that is desktop specific. The only desktop specific things I can think of were mouse pointers (which were easily fixed) and mousewheel.
   
   So far Ti MobileWeb is working great for a our desktop version. 
   
   Another benefit of the web version, is I can build a piece of functionality, compile in about 7 seconds and test. Nine times out ten, that code ports right back into the Android version. I can't begin to tell you just how valuable the web version of TI is; I'm saving literally 2 hours a day not having to compile to Android to test everything. </li>

   Good to hear. You have submitted a number of tickets and pull requests over last few weeks and we will make sure that they get due attention. Thanks for your help.</li>

    What is the PR for this? Can't seem to track down if anything was merged.</li>
