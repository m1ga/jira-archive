<h3>Description</h3>

On Mobile Web Buttons have two deficiencies.

1. Buttons are missing a font property, so you can't change the font size or face.
2. Buttons do not treat leading spaces in the "title" the same as other platforms. HTML ignores the spaces, so button.title = "   Some Text" would be treated as if it were button.title = "Some Text". This is not true on Android or iOS

I'm combining these as I have a fix I'll submit as a pull request.

   [~andrew@gstreetmedia.com] Why would you have whitespace at the beginning of a line of text in a button? Are you doing this for alignment, perhaps when the button has an icon?</li>
<li>Andrew Greenstreet 2014-03-31

   That is exactly the reason why. I only offered this up for parity, as in Android or iOS if you add whitespace characters to a button with an icon, the text will shift right. HTML will ignore the double whitespace and treat it as a single space.</li>

   [~andrew@gstreetmedia.com] Hmm, ok. I'm fine with inserting <code>&amp;nbsp;</code>, but we may also want to increase the default padding.</li>

   Verified fixed on:
   Mac OSX 10.9.3
   Appcelerator Studio, build: 3.3.0.201405121247
   Titanium SDK, build: 3.3.0.v20140515133312
   Titanium CLI, build: 3.3.0-dev
   Alloy: 1.4.0-alpha
   
   Leading whitespace is displayed correctly.
   Fonts are also recognised, chrome not displaying Helvetica-Light due to the browser not supporting it.
   Firefox successfully displays the font though.
   Closing.</li>
