<h3>Description</h3>

The scenario is as follows:
1. I build a project without any modules, everything ok.
2. I add a custom module and build again. This module requires to import external libs on the XCode project. The build fails as the libs are not there.
3. I open the XCode proj, add the libs.
4. Build from titanium again: now I get that it has to perform a full rebuild and XCode looses the references of the libs! Build fails.

Before 3.2 (and on ios 7 instead of iOS 7.03) step 4 was not doing a full rebuild of the project

   You cannot modify the Xcode project and expect the Titanium CLI to use it when rebuilding your app. I'm not a modules expert per se, but you will probably need to bundle all dependencies in your custom module.</li>
<li>Alexandros 2014-01-24

   That was exactly what I have been doing for some time Chris with the older version and it was very handful. 
   
   I have indeed bundled all dependecies in my custom module. These are the same dependencies however that the XCode project also needs. 
   
   As said, this is something that was working before 3.2.0.GA. 
   
   So, what is the solution you propose in this case?</li>
<li>Chris Barber 2014-01-24

   [~topcreations] When you say it was working before 3.2.0.GA, are you talking about 3.1.3.GA? Can you provide a reproducible test case? Can you give us your module to test with? If I can reproduce it, I'll reopen this ticket, fix it, escalate it, and ship it.</li>

   Build it using build.py and then copy the zip & extract it in the Library/Application Support/Titanium/modules folder as documented.</li>

   Chris I am attaching a demo module. This is a default module, with the only extra that I have added a 3rd party librady (BugSense) that I initialize on startup.
   
   When I build this (build.py) and then reference it from a newly created Titanium project, upon building I get 
   
   The following build commands failed:
   [ERROR] :  	Ld build/Debug-iphonesimulator/testamodule.app/testamodule normal i386</li>

   Reopening this ticket to investigate further based on attached module.</li>

   Moving this ticket to engineering for further evaluation.</li>
