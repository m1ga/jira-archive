<h3>Description</h3>

Animation does not work for activity indicator when using MobileWeb on Firefox. This is due to the setTimeout delay being too short.

   I'd love to. However, Github seems to only let me submit on pull request at a time. And since my initial pull request is from November 14 (and was never acted upon) all subsequent commits to my fork are queuing up in the same pull request. I don't profess to be a Github expert, but each time I click "create pull request" is takes me back to my original.</li>

   I see now why you have unrelated changes in the same pull request. It is one of the gotchas of github. Please take a look at a nice article that describes the best practices.

   An excerpt from the article:
   It's important to use a new branch for pull requests for several reasons:
   
   It allows you to submit multiple pull requests without confusion. The classical Github gotcha is to continue committing to a pull request branch after making the initial request. When these commits are pushed to the remote, they will become part of the original pull request which often ends up conflating unrelated functionality.
   
   Please resubmit individual pull requests for individual fixes / enhancements and we would take a look at them at a priority.

   I'm keeping a list of things I'm fixing @ <a href="https://github.com/gstreetmedia/titanium_mobile_mobileweb" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/gstreetmedia/titanium_mobile_mobileweb</a>
   
   Currently I'm having to fix at least one to two things daily. I'll try to push these back your way after I figure out Git (former Subversion user here). </li>

   Moving this ticket and PR to engineering for further evaluation.</li>
<li>Ingo Muschenetz 2014-04-28

   Based on comments, sounds like it needs to be bumped until we have a better handle on how to fix it.</li>

    I've updated the code in my pull request @
    <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/5371" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/5371</a>
    
    This version uses png's, reduces a lot of code complexity at the expense of some size to house four flavors of the indicator (white small, black small, white big, black big).
    
    I've tested it on every browser I can get my hands on and it seems to work very well across the board.
    
    Submitted for your review.</li>

    [~andrew@gstreetmedia.com] Awesome! I'll take a peek as soon as I have a second to breathe. Appreciate the pull request. :)</li>
<li>Lee Morris 2017-06-29

    Resolving ticket as "Won't fix" as MobileWeb has been deprecated.</li>
<li>Eric Merriman  2018-04-04

    Closing as will not fix.</li>
