   Looks like this is a Apple bug. Even though we are using a GA(public) version of Xcode, Apple Validation seems to be complaining that the app was not build with a public version of the Xcode 5.1.
   
   Did verify this behavior on a native app. This could be due to the fact that the Apple AppStore might not be ready to accept apps build with Xcode 5.1 & iOS 7.1, this bug might go away in a couple of days.
   
   Marking ticket as NOT OUR BUG, for now.</li>

   Validated this as well. Created a native app, and validated. Of course there were warnings galore, which I addressed. Once that was complete, I still failed the validation step. See attached screen "native.png".
   
   The sadly truncated text usually says something like: "This bundle is invalid. New apps and app updates submitted to the App Store must be built with public (GM) versions of Xcode 5 and iOS 7 SDK. Do not submit apps built with beta software. " and is supposed to go away at GM for Xcode and the SDK.</li>

   Closing ticket as the issue here is not our bug.</li>
