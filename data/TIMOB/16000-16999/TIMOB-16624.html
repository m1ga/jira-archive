<h3>Description</h3>

Would be nice to have an "install-only" feature in the CLI, for the cases when we connect a new device or start a new emulator, etc, and we just want to reinstall the app on that device without rebuilding everything.
This could also help for the cases when Ti fails to install on device (I get this from time to time on iOs)

I did something like this in SugarTi :)

   +1 for 3.3.0!</li>

   I was thinking about that the other day actually. Specifically a "ti run" command.</li>

   2 approaches:
   
   A run-only option, just like we have build-only:
   <code><pre>ti build -r -p ios -T device -C mine</pre></code>
   
   A run-command, with those options of the build-command needed to run:
   <code><pre>ti run -p ios -T device -C mine</pre></code>
   
   I think the first would be better and result in less (none) duplicate code.</li>

   The second is shorter and gives the user a better understanding of the process.
   *run* doesn't have anything to do with *build* imho</li>
<li>Fokke Zandbergen 2014-03-13

   True, but of course *build* does *run* as well. But agree, the second one has better ux.</li>
