   Does this relate to QE-388? I'm also not sure this is a Studio issue. Shouldn't it be a CLI/build process issue?</li>

   I linked it to QE-338 and moved the issue to TIMOB. 
   
   I'm also unable to record tests against said apps on Android. When I press Record Mobile App in Test, I get a TouchTest Agent error on the device: Failed to launch app (is it installed?).</li>

   I cannot reproduce with Appcelerator Studio 4.7 and Titanium SDK master (6.1.0). I've seen a similar behavior when the app name is changed and the previous app hasn't been uninstalled. I found TIMOB-16339 which kinda relates to this, but there's another ticket that I can't find for the life of me.</li>

   Closing ticket as the issue cannot be reproduced.</li>
