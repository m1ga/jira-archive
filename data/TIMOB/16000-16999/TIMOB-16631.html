<h3>Description</h3>

For both JIRA an Q&A it would be helpful if the CLI <code>info</code> command had an information type (<code>-t</code>) that would spit out a summary of the most important information on the environment, like - but not limited to:

- OS name and version
- Selected SDK
- CLI and Node.js version
- Studio version
- Warnings and critical issues

This information should include the 90% needed to clarify bug reports and Q's in a copy-paste friendly format. I would also suggest to include this summary at the end of the full (<code>ti info</code> or <code>ti info -t all</code>) report.

The JIRA <code>Environment</code> field description and the [Q&A submit-form](<a href="http://developer.appcelerator.com/question/ask)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://developer.appcelerator.com/question/ask)</a> should be updated to ask for this information.

Additionally, it would be awesome if the <code>build</code> command would get the same <code>--report</code> flag [as Hyperloop](<a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/hyperloop/blob/master/lib/log.js#L103)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/hyperloop/blob/master/lib/log.js#L103)</a> to include both the above and the app-specific information.

   Moving this enhancement request to engineering for further evaluation.</li>

   [~fokke] We believe that all of the above information is now captured in "ti info" (with the exception of Studio version). Does that match your understanding? If so, is this ticket then just about adding --report? Note that we submit tickets into JIRA as opposed to GitHub. Would this then create a TC ticket?</li>
<li>Chris Barber 2014-08-12

   I don't really see the value in <code>\-\-report</code> flag. If you ran a build and it failed, it's too late to go back and add the <code>\-\-report</code> flag. Furthermore, Studio isn't going to pass it in.
   
   What we need is a build.log file that contains the entire log output plus the info from <code>ti info</code> and <code>ti setup check</code>. Part of the problem is the logger is garbage and needs to be overhauled to support printing to the console and log files. I've got a ticket to add this: TIMOB-12169.
   
   My recommendation is to just resolve this ticket as won't fix and let's add support for build.log files. Thoughts?</li>
<li>Fokke Zandbergen 2014-08-12

   Ingo, the "ti info" includes lots of information not relevant to debug a build error. Too much to ask users to paste in the environment box of a JIRA ticket I'd think.
   
   What I like about the --report flag of Hyperloop is that it includes both environment and process info related to the error.
   
   Chris, only if the error would be a random one it would not make sense to run again using --report, but in most cases an error is not random and the second run would offer a easy way to produce a complete error report / ticket.
   
   Maybe best would be to improve the logger like you suggest and on (fatal) error always ask the user if he wants to save or submit relevant environment and process info or just exit?</li>

   This will be at least partially addressed by TIMOB-12169 which will include a banner like the following in the log for every build:
   
   <code><pre>
   Mon Nov 17 2014 11:38:32 GMT-0500 (EST)
   
   Build Environment 
      Host OS         = OS X 14.0.0, x64
      Target platform = iphone
      CLI version     = 3.5.0-dev
      SDK version     = 3.5.0
      SDK path        = /Users/admin/Library/Application Support/Titanium/mobilesdk/osx/3.5.0
      Node version    = v0.10.33
      Command         = titanium --sdk 3.5.0 build -p ios
   </pre></code>
   
   </li>

   That looks good [~skypanther] - I guess that closes this ticket [~cbarber]. Although sending errors directy to some kind of inbox of JIRA would still be nice.</li>
<li>Chris Barber 2014-11-19

   Fixed as apart of TIMOB-12169.
   
   There isn't an explicit <code>--report</code> flag, but a build log is a good start.</li>
<li>Eric Wieber 2015-03-19

   Verified fixed using:
   Titanium CLI 4.0.0-alpha
   
   environment is included in log</li>
</ol>
