<h3>Description</h3>

As specified in the summary, it seems like it is not possible to retrieve the coordinates of locations outside the configured region: every time I invoke <code>forwardGeocoder</code> I get back an error message (i.e. it was not possible to retrieve the coordinates for the specified address).

Is there a way to disable this restriction? 

On Android on the other hand, everything is working fine.

   Can you please attach a simple runnable test case so that we can investigate more and try to reproduce the issue?</li>

   Please have a look at the attached application.  Hope it helps.</li>

   I noticed that "London, UK" does not work but "London" does but coordinates are not that of "London, UK". Would it be possible for you to specify a USA address without the country name (for example, Denver, CO) outside the region specified in system settings and see if it works? It would help us to narrow down the issue.</li>

   I am so sorry for the very late answer but I did not notice you got back to me -- I did not received any notification email.
   
   By the way, unfortunately I can't try it right now as I don't have neither my iPhone nor my emulator handy, but I can guarantee that with the system region set to France, I was able to look up French locations only.
   
   How come everything is working fine on Android?  Does this mean different API calls are done depending on the OS?</li>
