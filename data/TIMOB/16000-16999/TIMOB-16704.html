<h3>Description</h3>

In an Alloy Project, when rendering a ListView with ListItems using an external Custom template, sometimes the Views contained in the vertical layout will be rendered not in proper order. 

For example, if my template contains a view with a vertical layout and inside it there are two child views, view A and view B, sometimes the order of the two will change, displaying sometimes A first and then B, while other times B will be first and A will be second.

The expected behaviour should be for view A to be displayed always first and then view B should be underneath view A.

I'm supplying two images showing the expected behaviour and the unexpected behaviour, plus a test project, if the items aren't rendered as in the unexpected behaviour image close the app and try again, sometimes it happens the first time and others after 5 or 6 tries.

If the vertical layout is removed then the views overlaps on each other but which view is shown on top changes. For example, sometimes view A will be on top view B, while other times view B will be on top of view A. The expected behaviour here should be first view declared on the xml should be the one on the bottom while the last view declared on the xml should be the one on the top.

The unexpected behaviour happens at an inconsistent rate so it's hard to predict when will it happen or at least I haven't being able to pinpoint what triggers the bug.
