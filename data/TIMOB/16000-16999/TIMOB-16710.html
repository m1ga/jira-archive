<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Description</h4>
The latest Android SDK-Tools (22.6.2) causes any project with the SDK set to 3.2.2.GA or lower to fail if building to emulator.
Android devices work fine with any version of the SDK.
This means that users must either use the 3.2.3 branch, or not update their Android SDK-Tools version.

<h4>Steps To Reproduce</h4>
1. Update to Android SDK-Tools to version 22.6.2
2. Create a default emulator or let Studio create one for you
3. Set the SDK version to 3.2.2 or below
4. Build to the emulator

<h4>Expected Result</h4>
Project should be installed to emulator

<h4>Actual Result</h4>
Project fails to build

   Attempted to test this ticket however ran into the following problem.
   
   Downgrading to Android SDK-Tools 22.6.2 is possible, however this issue occurred due to a combination of:
   Android SDK-Tools: 22.6.2
   Android Platform-Tools: 19.0.1
   Android Build-Tools: 19.0.3
   
   It's not possible to install an earlier version of Platform-Tools as Google only offers the latest version which is 20.
   I have no way of getting into the correct environment to test this ticket.
   
   Using:
   Mac OSX 10.9.3
   Android SDK-Tools: 22.6.2 
   Android Platform-Tools: 20
   Android Build-Tools: 19.1
   Titanium SDK: 3.2.2.GA
   Titanium CLI: 3.2.3.GA
   
   I was able to build build and install an application to emulator.</li>
