   +1 on this feature, very much needed, need back history support, etc which views don't offer, and not always convenient or correct to start a new activity.</li>

   On a related note: the current behavior wherein a new window opened from a tab window is a new Activity doesn't really make sense in my opinion. A child window opened from a tab window should be a fragment, where the back button returns as usual to the parent window. Thus we can maintain ActionBar state through to the child window, etc. This makes a lot more sense..... Alternatively, if the developer really does want a new Activity then he can do so by opening a new Window, not as a tab window child. Actually, this can be the case for any Window which may want to have some kind of a daughter view that maintains ActionBar state, logical back button history, etc. In other words - we need some kind of a "lightweight" window that preserves activity state, and fragments are the way to do it.</li>

   Can this be done for 3.3.0? We really need an alternative to LW windows.</li>

   Hi Mark, unfortunately, feature freeze for 3.3.0 is next week, so there is no way we can add this to 3.3.0 now. However, we can (and will) look at it for the next release.</li>
