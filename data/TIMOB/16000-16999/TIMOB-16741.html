<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Issue description</h4>
An Android Tablet Kindle HDX device running the same app, at around the 10 time alternation mark the webView event listener stops receiving the events and the webView will not receive any events.

<h4>Steps to replicate </h4>
<h4>Get example available at: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/nzjhsu5as8dc1nf/MapWebViewBugExample_Remove_And_Re-addEvents.zip" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.dropbox.com/s/nzjhsu5as8dc1nf/MapWebViewBugExample_Remove_And_Re-addEvents.zip</a></h4>
<h4>Alternate clicking between the setLocation 1 and setLocation 2 buttons. </h4>
<h4>Notice that the map moves when each is hit. Perform this alternate clicking 30+ times.</h4>
<h4>Notice how the map always moves and the webView receives the "app:map:setLocation" event. This never fails on iOS and most Android Tablets.</h4>

<h4>Devices Affected by this issue: </h4>
Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 
 - 14.3.2.1 Model: GU045RW
 - 14.3.2.1 Model: GU045RW

Kindle Fire HDX 7
 - 13.3.1.0 - Model: C9R6QM
 - 13.3.2.1 - Model: C9R6QM

<h4>Devices not affected</h4>
None of iOS devices. The 2.3.4 HTC Incredible and Nexus 7 running 4.3 don't seem to exhibit the problem.

<h4>Background</h4>
This issue seems to occur very quickly on the Kindle HDX 8.9 inch (~10 events) and it is the main use case for the Google Web Map. Another Android Tablets reproduces this although not consistently.

   Sample app was tested using: 
   Kindle Fire HD 8.9 Model No. 3HT7G 
   Kindle Fire HD (2012) Model No. X43Z60 
   Ti SDK: 3.2.1
   
   These were the closest devices we had available, and we were not able to reproduce the problem. Buttons remained responsive well beyond 30 alternations.</li>

   Those devices are not Kindle HDX's as this ticket was reported on. On the [Amazon page](<a href="https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/devices/kindle-fire/specifications/01-device-and-feature-specifications#Feature" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/devices/kindle-fire/specifications/01-device-and-feature-specifications#Feature</a> Detection)
   
   All the Build.MODEL's of the Amazon's Kindle devices are listed. The devices that are affected by this issue are those with the Build.MODEL's:
    * KFAPWA
    * KFAPWI
    * KFTHWA
    * KFTHWI
   
   They are the only Kindle Devices affected by this issue and they are the Kindle HDX 8.9 and 7 inch devices. 
   
   To access the Build.MODEL use the Titanium.Platform.model Platform property.</li>

   The two devices we have on hand are builds KFJWI (the 8.9" HD) and KFTT (the 7" HD). I will look into the procurement of a fitting device for this test or if we can possibly replicate this issue in an emulated setting.</li>

   The Kindle Fire HDX 7" was ordered recently to replicate this error.</li>
<li>Joshua Rhinehart 2014-05-05

   We received the HDX 7" and were able to reproduce this issue very quickly (~2 clicks). The map is still responsive to pan events, and the buttons seem to be as well, as I see " [INFO] :   app:map:setLocation Fired -> " in the console for each tap, however it seems the process breaks down somewhere else, perhaps in the process of resetting the EventListeners?</li>

   I don't believe this will go into 3.4.0 as the proposed fix is likely very Kindle HDX-specific. We will need to figure out how to deliver that.</li>

   PR to add support for a flag to enable/disable polling: <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/5994" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/5994</a>
   
   To toggle the creation only property (the value is true by default), do the following when creating a webview.
   
   <code><pre>
   Ti.UI.createWebView({
       polling: false
   });
   </pre></code></li>
<li>Allen Yeung 2014-08-29

   Placed on hold until we verify that the PR is required.</li>
