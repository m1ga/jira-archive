   Hi Ingo, 
   The issue did not occur for previous sdk. It occurred for 3.2.3.v20140326144913 sdk only.
   
   Today its working fine with Environment:
   OSX: 10.9.2
    Xcode: 5.1
    Appcelerator Studio: 3.2.3.201403271839
   SDK: 3.2.3.v20140327115429
   acs:1.0.14
   alloy:1.3.1
    npm:1.3.2 
   titanium:3.2.3-alpha2 
   titanium-code-processor:1.1.1-alpha
    Device: iPhone 5c (7.1)
   
   And really sorry about adding Priority instead of Severity by mistake. Will take care in future.
   
   Thanks & Regards,
   -Pragya</li>

   it still happens with 3.3.0.GA .
   
   It's random as said above. </li>

   It's happenning to me quite often to.
   I'm currently using a multiple Xcode configuration to support building old applications (changing my Xcode version suing xcode-select -s command).
   I always solve this problem by unpluging / repluging the mobile device.</li>

    Alas this happens to me more often than it doesn't! :(
    
    It has done so on every version of Ti since I first started testing on teh mac about a year ago (feb 2014)</li>

    Hi All, this is still happening for me regularly. Is there a fix or a workaround at least. No other clues given. Works fine in simulator. Happy to do elaborate workaround if necessary but I need app on device ASAP.
    
    Thanks
