<h3>Description</h3>

We have a production application in the Google Play app store that uses a webview to access our mobile site. The mobile site shows a modal popup when the user clicks/taps the 'Add to Cart' button on the homepage (or any other page). The modal popup is working on the default Android web browser, but in the app's webview, it does not show properly. The modal will appear if you scroll up the webview a bit (but it disappears after the scrolling end) and it is empty of content. I have attached a screenshot of how the modal popup should look (as seen in the default Android web browser). 

Here is our production application that this bug is currently seen in: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hdsupply.whitecapapp&hl=en" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hdsupply.whitecapapp&hl=en</a>

   We were able to replicate this issue with the following steps:
   
   1. Download the Android app "White Cap" from Google Play
   2. Click on "Shop"
   3. Scroll down and then click "add to cart"
   4. No modal box appears, although if you scroll up and down you see a ghost, 1 line modal box
   
   Before replicating this issue, my Android device was on 4.4 and the modal was working fine.  It was only after updating to 4.4.2 that the modal no longer pops up.  HD Supply developer: "The modal popup is implemented using a dojo widget and triggered by the ajax call the button makes."</li>

   The source code for the HTML that is being located inside of the WebView of the White Cap app is located at: <a href="http://m.whitecap.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/TopCategoriesDisplay?storeId=11301&langId=-1&catalogId=11101" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://m.whitecap.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/TopCategoriesDisplay?storeId=11301&langId=-1&catalogId=11101</a>
   
   If it is necessary, we may be able to obtain the modal box web source code.  Please let me know if that is necessary or if this behavior is observed with all modal boxes in Android 4.4.2 .</li>

   [~btran] Would you mind posting the workaround they used? That would likely help others here as well. We should also remove the "immediate" priority.</li>
