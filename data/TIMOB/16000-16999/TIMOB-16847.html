<h3>Description</h3>

Sample App: <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/54185251/TextFieldTest.zip" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/54185251/TextFieldTest.zip</a> 

1.- Run the sample application on a windows device (internet explorer) 
2.- Focus the 1st text field, then focus the 2nd one, then 3rd one, and then the 4th one. 
3.- Observe how the black area's height seems to increase as you focus the four text fields on the screen; at this point, when the 4th text field has the focus on it, the screen is practically all black. 

Expected Result: The window scrolls up on each focus and reveals the following objects on the view.

Actual Result: The window scrolls up but fails to render data previously blocked by the keyboard, creating a large black box.

   Dupe of TIMOB-16528.
   
   We don't have a good general workaround. The fix is deep within the Mobile Web layout engine. iOS has a similar issue. You can sometimes hack something in your code to limit this issue.</li>

   Closing ticket as Windows Hybrid is no longer supported.</li>
