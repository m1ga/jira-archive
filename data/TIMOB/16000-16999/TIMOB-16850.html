   I had tested customer's issue. Everything works fine in my android device. 
   push notification still working after "force stop", and pre-existing notifications in the device tray are still there as well.
   
   I made the test like the following steps:
   1. Subscribe to push notification.
   2. Send "test 1" push notification to device.
   3. "test 1" notification displayed in tray.
   4. Force to stop the app.
   5. Send "test 2" push notification to device.
   6. "test 2" notification displayed in tray and "test 1" notification is still in tray.

   Hello [~sliang], what software does your android device have? 
   My notifications disappear if I force stop the app. Android 4.4.2 Nexus 5. </li>

   Asking customer for their Device specs. </li>

   Android 4.2.2 Nexus 5
   
   I tested it with my simple app. </li>

   I was able to clear/stop the flow of push notifications on 4.2.X and 4.4.X android versions. Not receiving push notifications after the app is force stopped is normal behavior. I passed this info to the customer. Closing as invalid. </li>

   This is expected behavior for GCM messages: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20838415/gcm-push-notification-works-after-app-force-stop" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20838415/gcm-push-notification-works-after-app-force-stop</a></li>
