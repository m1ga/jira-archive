<h3>Description</h3>

For the last couple of releases of the mobile SDK (I just upgraded to 3.2.2) I've had to apply the patch as described in <a href="http://developer.appcelerator.com/question/153366/crash-on-310-related-with-timob-11586" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://developer.appcelerator.com/question/153366/crash-on-310-related-with-timob-11586</a>, or the app would crash instantly.

I'm unclear on the implications of applying this patch, but I see no more crashes in my app.

   It would be great if you can provide a simple runnable test case that demonstrates this crash without your patch. It would help to diagnose this issue further.</li>

   [~srahim] to see if this section of code still exists in 3.3.0. it may be fixed with latest versions.</li>

   [~ingo][~ngupta] We have refactored that entire piece of code block in 3.3.0 . This was done as part of TIMOB-15855. I would assume this refactor would have taken care of the crash but we would need a proper test case to ensure that the bug is actually resolved. </li>

   [~marten] It's believed this may no longer be an issue in 3.3.0. Can you please try this with the latest RC versions (from build.appcelerator.com)? If it still persists, can you please provide a test case for us to reproduce on our side? Thanks!</li>

   Tested with 3.3.0RC and can no longer reproduce.</li>
