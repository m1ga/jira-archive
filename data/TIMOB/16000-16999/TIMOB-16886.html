<h3>Description</h3>

Accepted PR <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/5631" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/5631</a> added SearchView functionality for all Android versions, so for simplicity we can remote SearchBar for Android, which is now an unnecessary hack.

   SearchBar is supported on both iOS and Android platforms so it is still useful to have the same code base across multiple platforms. We also cannot break existing applications by removing SearchBar.</li>

   Hi Ritu, the Titanium SearchBar for Android does not model a standard Android UI element. With 3.3.0 we have ActionBar for all versions, and the Android design guidelines ask that apps use the ActionBar for search functionality - and we have this. If someone wants to do something different, they can put the SearchView elsewhere in the window, or use a TextField for searching. Frankly I think it's overhead to keep supporting SearchBar where it's not needed, especially as the porting to SearchView (or TextField) is a breeze. Just my 2 cents :)</li>

   Moving this deprecation request to engineering for further evaluation.</li>

   Would it be worthwhile to map the SearchBar to the new SearchView?</li>
<li>Mark Mokryn 2014-11-16

   [~ingo] absolutely, yes. Also note that SearchView in AppCompat for Lollipop offers new features that should be reviewed in any case: <a href="http://android-developers.blogspot.co.il/2014/10/appcompat-v21-material-design-for-pre.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://android-developers.blogspot.co.il/2014/10/appcompat-v21-material-design-for-pre.html</a> , the section on SearchView</li>
