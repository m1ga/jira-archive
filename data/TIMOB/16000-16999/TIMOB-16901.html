<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Issue</h4>

When setting a custom location for the archive files in Xcode and building from Studio the file is saved in the default location /Users/username/Library/Developer/Xcode/Archives  instead of the new directory making the archive file unavailable for the organizer.

<h4>Steps to repro</h4>

Open Xcode Preferences
Modify Archive directory in Locations to /Users/username/documents/archive
In Studio package an app for iTunes Store

Expected Results:
The .xcarchive file will be created in the custom directory /Users/username/documents/archive and will be available in the Xcode Organizer for Validation and Upload

Actual Results:
The .xcarchive file is created in the default directory /Users/username/Library/Developer/Xcode/Archives  and is not available for the Xcode Organizer to be validated.

   Is this related to an existing ticket?</li>

   I don't recollect there is an existing ticket for this issue. Also, I think this issue should be handled through CLI.</li>

   This is caused by [this hardcoded line](<a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/blob/master/iphone/cli/hooks/package.js#L40)." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/blob/master/iphone/cli/hooks/package.js#L40).</a> -I'm wondering what Studio does with the custom path.- 
   
   The custom path is set [here](<a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/blob/master/iphone/cli/hooks/package.js#L192)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/blob/master/iphone/cli/hooks/package.js#L192)</a> and could be used above as well.</li>

   I've already labeled this issue as <code>cb-tooling</code> and it will be addressed in the next build system.</li>

   Ohh, that's what it's for. Alright then! The change is a one-liner, but that's also fine!</li>
