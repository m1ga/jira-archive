<h3>Description</h3>

Unable to build project with GA version when app created with latest sdk installed from studio.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create new classic/alloy app with the latest build installed(3.3.0.v20140512162513) and run the app.
2. Now edit the tiapp.xml with any GA version (3.2.3.GA) and save the file and run the app again.

Actual Result:
1. App builds and install successfully with latest build,3.3.0.v20140512162513
2. Still the app gets builds with latest installed sdk 3.3.0 build instead of selected GA version.

Expected Result:
Both the times app must get build with correct sdk version selected in tiapp.xml. 

Notes:
1.CLI also shows the same behavior.
2.If you create project with 3.2.3.GA sdk build then it always build the app with 3.2.3.GA build even if sdk-version in tiapp.xml is edited

   To test, set the selected sdk to 3.3.0 and build using an older sdk (like 3.2.3.GA).</li>
<li>Lokesh Choudhary 2014-05-14

   Still Reproducible. Reopening.
   
   1.Created an app with 3.3.0 sdk selected(in CLI & Tiapp.xml). 
   2.Changed the SDK to 3.2.3.GA.
   3.Ran/Built the app.
   4.Logs show me 3.3.0 SDK being used.
   
   Environment:
   Appc Studio : 3.3.0.201405121247
   Ti SDK : 3.3.0.v20140513191712
   Mac OSX : 10.8.5
   Alloy : 1.4.0-dev
   CLI - 3.3.0-dev installed on 05/14/14
   Samsung Galaxy S4 running android 4.2.2</li>

   STUDIO BUG!!!!</li>
<li>Priya Agarwal 2014-05-15

   Reopening the issue since the issue is still reproducible.
   
   Environment Used:
   Appc-Studio:3.3.0.201405121247
   sdk:3.3.0.v20140514163013
   acs:1.0.14
   alloy:1.4.0-alpha
   npm:1.3.2
   titanium:3.3.0-dev
   titanium-code-processor:1.1.1
   xcode:5.1.1
   Device:Iphone5s(v7.1.1),Nexus7(v4.4.2)
   
   See the below scenarios and observations - 
   
   1) Create a new project from CLI using latest SDK 3.3.0 build. Then open the tiapp.xml from terminal and set the SDK build as 3.2.3.GA. Build the app from CLI and observed that build happen using the SDK build 3.2.3.GA which I set into tiapp.xml file.
   
   2) Create a new project from Studio using latest SDK 3.3.0 build. Then open the tiapp.xml from Studio and set and save the SDK build as 3.2.3.GA. Now go to terminal and inside the project directory. Open the tiapp.xml file and observed that SDK build is still showing latest 3.3.0 sdk build instead of 3.2.3.GA build. Because of this if I build this project from Studio/CLI, it picks the latest SDK 3.3.0 build only.
   
   As per the above scenarios, CLI shows the correct behavior but Studio is unable to set the SDK build other than which has been used at the time of project creation.</li>

   [~pagarwal] This is a Studio bug. This is not a CLI or SDK bug. [~pinnamuri] is aware of the issue, but if you'd like, create a TISTUD issue and assign it to him. Resolving as fixed.</li>
<li>Ingo Muschenetz 2014-05-15

   [~pinnamuri] Do you have the Studio bug to link to this? Actually, I am assuming it's TISTUD-6490?</li>

   Linked the related ticket .</li>
<li>Lokesh Choudhary 2014-05-16

   Closing as this is a studio issue. Please refer to the related ticket linked for this issue.
