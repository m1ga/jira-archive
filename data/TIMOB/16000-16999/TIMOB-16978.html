<h3>Description</h3>

We will need to work with SOASTA on this.
SOASTA supports adding TouchTestIDs to subclass of Ti.Ui.View, but Titanium.UI.ListItem is a subclass of Titanium.Proxy.

They support the interaction (recording/playback) of ListItems, but do not support adding TouchTestIDs to them as they are not a child of Ti.UI.View.

We have a customer (Dogfish) who is heavily using ListItems and needs to be able to add TTIDs to them for testing. How feasible is this?

   In my testing, touchtest recognizes labels and child views but not the list item itself. As Sabil mentioned, the listItem view is not exposed, only the composite view is. TTIDS added inside the properties object are not recognized, nor are TTID's added as their own property. It appears either SOASTA would need to configure their client to pick up the itemID associated with the list Item, or we would have to expose the List Item view. 
   Can Dogfish use another locator element as a work-around in the meantime?</li>

   The due date is today (May 23rd). Is that still correct?</li>
<li>Eric Wieber 2014-05-23

   I am moving the due date out to next Friday.
   
   We have a call with SOASTA about this issue on Tuesday, but this is still a critical issue.</li>

   Hi all, what is the current status here?</li>
<li>Eric Wieber 2014-06-20

   Sabil and Vishal gave Mukul (the SOASTA engineer) some guidance and a plan for detecting the TTIDs on ListItems. We have not yet heard back from him and I have asked for an update. This will be discussed again on Monday's SWAT call with SOASTA.</li>

   SOASTA's ETA for this is their next major release in November (SOASTA 54). Mukul is working and will ask for a meeting with Vishal if necessary.</li>

   [~ingo]There are very few details on their ticketing side for this issue other than the initial ticket and a second post that says they would have moved it to us to implement:
   "Section 1 - Problem Description]
   Dogfish has added TouchTestid to ListViews but while recording we do not pick up the TouchTestId
   
   We would need help from Appcelerator to get this implemented. We require that the view be a TiUIView for TouchTestIds to work. If AppC can change the framework such that ListItems inherit from TiUIView, touchTest ids will work.
   
   Currently Mukul is working with Appcelerator to figure out a solution"
   
   [~ewieber] Do you have any other information on this?</li>

   [~rtlechuga] We have decided to de-prioritize it so it is not on our immediate roadmap. Can you please deprioritize it?</li>
