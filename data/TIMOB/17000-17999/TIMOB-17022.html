   [~emerriman] regression, I assume?</li>

   I intended to test variable combinations KS(version 3.3.0) and SDK(3.3.X/3.2.3.GA) builds and it seems to be not a regression.
   <h4>Actual result</h4>
   blur event is not fired, when click on Blur button
   
   I cannot test KS version 3.2.3.GA with SDK, build 3.3.X due to unsupported Holo themes.</li>

   This isn't a bug. Blur is fired but since the TextArea is the only focusable widget on screen, it gets refocus by Android. Since the label updates whenever blur or focus fires, focus text overrides blur text, creating the illusion that blur never fire. Basically when you click on 'blur', these events will fire:  blur -> focus. I suggest change the test case to log whenever these events fire, instead of using a label to display the latest event that is fired.</li>
