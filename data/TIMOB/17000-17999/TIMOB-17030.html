<h3>Description</h3>

When OTHER_CFLAGS are defined in module.xcconfig they are only applied to Release builds.

This issue makes it very hard to test my module in an app, and users of my module are confused as to why they only works in Release builds.

   If I see it correct (and of course need more time to sort things out), this pieces of the <code>titanium_mobile/iphone/cli/commands/_buildModule.js</code> could cause the problem:
   
   <code><pre>
   
   	// Create a build for the device
   	xcodebuildHook(this.xcodeEnv.executables.xcodebuild, [
   		'-configuration', 'Release',
   		'-sdk', 'iphoneos'
   	], opts, 'xcode-dist', done);
   
   	// Create a build for the simulator
   	xcodebuildHook(this.xcodeEnv.executables.xcodebuild, [
   		'-configuration', 'Release',
   		'-sdk', 'iphonesimulator'
   	], opts, 'xcode-sim', done);
   </pre></code>
   
   So changing the second hook (which is responsible for sim-builds) to <code>Debug</code> could actually do something. [~cbarber] Any quick advice?</li>

   [~hansknoechel] We only support building "Release" builds for iOS modules. Either this ticket is a won't fix or we can introduce <code>\-\-deploy\-type</code> for module builds where it would default to "production", but could be set to "development" which in turn would set the configuration to "Debug". Thoughts?</li>

   As per Chris' comment above, modules should not have debug configurations. </li>

   Closing ticket as Won't Fix with reference to the above comments.</li>
