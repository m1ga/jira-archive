The console should receive associated output during the build to denote errors etc. \r\n\r\nOn build completion we should be able to access the ipa through a standardized distribution mechanism.",

					"body": "Agree with you Barber on the Mac comment - but the enterprise world is still very MSFT focused.\r\n\r\nbasically we get a lot of requests / asks from prospects or customers on whether or not they can build for IOS while programming on WIndows. Short of building a full cloud compilation system to do this, i was thinking that there might be a way to trigger the Titanium CLI on a networked mac server. We wouldn't need to send the code / project over the network, we could pull from source control. \r\n\r\nI know the obvious thought here is that its starting to sound like a CI tool, so one way to look at this would be to update the run configuration for a platform target to include a field to enter a jenkins URL or other remote trigger url for a centralized build server. i can see this as being handy for building on windows from a Mac as well.",
