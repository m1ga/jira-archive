   I can see the splash screen working in a tablet both in landscape and portrait mode. In a phone, the splash screen is hard to see as the activity get rotated to landscape as the phone is locked for portrait mode but you can clearly see the splash screen when you launch recent apps in landscape and launch the app from there.
   I don't think this is a bug.</li>

   [~sunila] can you confirm what tablet you are using?  Also you are using the test app associated with this ticket?  Finally, please confirm you are starting the app in portrait mode and then it launches in landscape mode.</li>

   I tried with my Motorola zoom tablet. No, I didn't try with the test app, I created a new classic sample app and tried. I will try with the sample app and let you know my findings.</li>
<li>Sunila 2014-07-07

   I tried with the sample and since the 'screenOrientation' is set to 'nosensor' in the tiApp.xml, even if I keep the tablet in portrait, it switches to landscape (as the default is landscape for most of the tablets and portrait for most of the phones) and it is hard to see the splash screen because of this. I don't think this is a bug, Because of the orientation change, the splash screen is hard to see. Try changing the 'screenOrientation' to 'sensor' and you will see the splash screen.</li>
<li>Alan Leard 2014-07-07

   The use case is that we have to use 'nosensor'.  They want a single app that is locked in portrait for handheld and landscape for tablet, including proper splash screens.  This was the only way we could find to achieve this.  If you have another suggestion that will work, we can use sensor, but otherwise we need to see the proper splash screen regardless what orientation the device is in when the app is opened.</li>
<li>Sunila 2014-07-08

   I didn't know about this use case. Here is what you can try, instead of specifying the 'screenOrientation' in the the manifest file, do this through the code, something like
   
   <code><pre>
         var win = Titanium.UI.createWindow({  
   	    title:'Sound Bug',
   	    fullscreen: true,
   	    exitOnClose: true    
   	});
   	var lbl = Ti.UI.createLabel({
   		text: "Sample Project"
   		});
   	
   	win.add(lbl);
   	win.addEventListener("open", function(e){
   		if (isTablet) {
   			win.getActivity().setRequestedOrientation(Ti.Android.SCREEN_ORIENTATION_LANDSCAPE);
   		} else {
   			win.getActivity().setRequestedOrientation(Ti.Android.SCREEN_ORIENTATION_PORTRAIT);
   		}
   		})
   	win.open();
   </pre></code></li>

   Cannot reproduce the issue on Galaxy Tab (3.2). The splash screen shows consistently in portrait mode.
   Can reproduce the issue on Nexus 10 (4.2). The splash screen shows intermittently in portrait mode.</li>
<li>Allen Yeung 2014-07-24

   I tried on a Nexus 7 and a Nexus 10, and the splash screen always shows up correctly for me.  On the nexus 10, if I have it in portrait, it is forced to be in landscape.  On a nexus 7, it was the opposite which is the expected behavior.  I did have a hard time seeing the splash screen most of the time since the app loads so fast.  I had to artificially delay the splash screen to confirm that it was loading right.... In a simple alloy app, I just delayed opening the window:
   
   <code><pre>
   setTimeout(function (){
   	$.index.open();
   },3000)
   </pre></code></li>
<li>Ingo Muschenetz 2014-08-27

    If I understand correctly, this issue is just because the splash screen is showing up too quickly, not that there is an inherent bug. Please let me know if that's not your understanding.</li>
