   This is an issue that is being requested by many of FIS banking clients to ensure greater security access without use of text strings. It is being viewed as a more secure way to manage permissions than traditional methods and they hope to have this ready for the iOS8 release for their customers requesting it.</li>

   This ticket says "2014 Sprint 15 Alloy " sprint, what does it mean? Is it only Alloy specific or what else? Please clarify as the customer FIS is inquiring. </li>

   It's in the wrong sprint. I fixed it already.</li>

   Uploaded module code to <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator-modules/ti.touchid" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator-modules/ti.touchid</a>
   Uploaded module zip to this ticket.
   
   *WARNING*
   This is still in experimental phase. To use this module you must use Xcode 6 as the default "Xcode select" and target iOS 8. Also, this is a device-only API
   
   *Note:* 
   Your project will not compile for iOS 7. If the app fails to build using the Titanium CLI, or Studio, open the generated Xcode project in Xcode 6 and run it from there. Make sure the target is set to iOS 8
