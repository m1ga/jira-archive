   Moving to CLI, as the IP address for the Genymotion emulator would be return from CLI to Studio.</li>

   Genymotion VMs are registered with ADB as the IP address. The Titanium CLI should be trying to look up that VM's name in VirtualBox based on the IP address. I suppose if we can't determine the real name via VirtualBox, then we must be falling back to the IP. Will need to investigate.</li>

   I tried to reproduce this issue built couldn't. It appears that the Genymotion emulator is being picked up as a device, or more technically NOT an Android emulator. I tried breaking the code to reproduce this error and the closest I got was deleting the Genymotion detection library, but even then Studio prints "Genymotion (phone)".</li>
