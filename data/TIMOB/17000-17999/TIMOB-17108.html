<h3>Description</h3>

APSHTTPClient should have its design and implementation peer reviewed. Publishing a new library that is a dependency for Appcelerator projects should undergo critical peer review. Characteristics that such a library should be held to account for are:

1. If it is going to do things different than Apple, then it needs to make the case that convinces a jury of its peers for why it is better.
2. It needs to compare and contrast itself with other respected open source libraries that provide similar functionality that convinces a jury of its peers for why it is better.
