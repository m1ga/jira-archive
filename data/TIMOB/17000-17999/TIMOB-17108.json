If it is going to do things different than Apple, then it needs to make the case that convinces a jury of its peers for why it is better.\r\n2. It needs to compare and contrast itself with other respected open source libraries that provide similar functionality that convinces a jury of its peers for why it is better.\r\n \r\n",
