   Company URL is not required if you pass in <code>\-\-no-prompt</code>. In fact, the only required options are <code>\-\-name</code> and <code>\-\-id</code>. The idea is if you have prompting enabled, then it's ok to prompt for these fields. I guess I didn't think it was that annoying and figured somebody may appreciate being able to set it at app creation time instead of forgetting to do it later.</li>

   I've always seen the prompt mode (which is the default right?) as a back fall, only asking for required missing options. Maybe we need 3 modes?
   
   1. <code>--no-prompt</code>: Never prompt, just fail if required options are missing
   2. <code>--all-prompt</code>: Prompt for all possible options not set via args
   3. <code>--req-prompt</code>: Only prompt for missing required options
   
   And I think the 3rd should be default.</li>

   I'd much rather only prompt for missing required options instead of adding 2 new prompt related flags. The fix is trivial. I'll bring it up tomorrow in the triage meeting.</li>

   When creating a project, it is by design that we prompt for project information, required or not. This is a usability thing. If you already have a URL in the tiapp.xml, then you simply need to press enter to accept the default. Resolving as won't fix.</li>

   Closing ticket as Won't Fix with reference to the above comments.</li>
