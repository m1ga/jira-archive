<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Feature Request</h4>
To support settings link in iOS Permission Prompts on iOS 7.1 & 8

<h4>Description</h4>
In iOS 7.1 and iOS 8 there is some functionality for permission dialogs which we would like to take advantage of in the future if its possible. 

In the native Apple Maps the first time the user clicks on the [My Location] button they are prompted with the normal location access dialog. If the user clicks [Don't Allow] the prompt goes away as expected. If the user then clicks the [My Location] button again they are prompted with a new second dialog which has 2 options [Settings | Cancel] If the user clicks on [Settings] they are then taken to the Locations Services page where they can enable or disable location access for the Apple Maps application. 

Can Titanium add support for the settings link as shown in the second dialog or if that is controlled by iOS so it cannot be accessed.

   -We can achieve API parity with Android as well since Android 6.0 has similar app permissions. But direct launching of aggregated permission page as in iOS is not available. User will be launched to app settings page and one click away from permissions.-
   
   Can be down with [~fokkezb] solution.</li>

   You can do so via:
   
   <code><pre>
   	if (OS_IOS) {
   		Ti.Platform.openURL('app-settings:');
   	}
   
   	if (OS_ANDROID) {
   		var intent = Ti.Android.createIntent({
   			action: 'android.settings.APPLICATION_SETTINGS',
   		});
   		intent.addFlags(Ti.Android.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK);
   		Ti.Android.currentActivity.startActivity(intent);
   	}
   </pre></code>
   
   Haven't managed to get Android to open the settings for the specific app</li>

   Opening the settings via openURL and displaying the location prompt are already supported since a while now. Resolving as fixed based on that.</li>
