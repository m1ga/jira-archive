<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Problem description</h4>
Build fails to install and launch when building on any other device/simulator other than the first one.

The issue seems to be relative to LiveView version 1.0.4
Using LiveView 1.0.3 and everything else 3.3.0, this issue is not reproducible - in this case the app is built and run correctly on the new device/simulator and LiveView is only working and updating modifications in the latest device/simulator used (so, is supporting only one device at a time).
Marking as regression.

<h4>Steps to reproduce</h4>
1. Create a new default app from Studio (classic or Alloy)
2. Enable LiveView and build/run on iOS simulator
Result: app build and runs correctly. LiveView is working as expected (so every change made to the code is correctly updated on the running application)
3. Keep LiveView enabled and build/run on a different device or OS (for example, build for Android device)
Result: App fails to install and run. The following error logs are displayed:

Also, on iOS simulator, an Application Error is now displayed. See screenshot.

   I'm assuming this must be a regression caused by the fix for TIMOB-16740.</li>
<li>Praveen Innamuri 2014-06-18

   [~ingo] Not sure. But this has to be addressed for 3.3.0 release.</li>
