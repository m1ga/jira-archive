   This affects the use of ti.admob as Jon updated it to use one of the latest google-play-services.jar.
   This is not a CLI issue, but a module issue and needs to be reassigned as such.

   Tested on:
   Mac OSX 10.9.3
   Appcelerator Studio, build: 3.3.0.201406271159
   Titanium SDK, build: 3.3.0.v20140627202512
   Titanium CLI, build: 3.3.0-rc4
   Alloy: 1.4.0-rc3
   ti.cloudpush: 3.3.0
   ti.map: 2.1.4
   
   Managed to reproduce the error, however the workaround for this issue is posted in the error message.
   Copy the google-play-services.jar file from one module into the other module and the project will build.
   
   <code><pre>
   [ERROR] Application Installer abnormal process termination. Process exit value was 1
   [ERROR] :  Conflicting jar files detected:
   [ERROR] :  
   [ERROR] :  The following modules have different "google-play-services.jar" files
   [ERROR] :     ti.cloudpush   (version 3.3.0) (hash=e76996f76f95f1b78af7efc3949b6542)
   [ERROR] :     ti.map         (version 2.1.4) (hash=d424e23c8c3cc78af897bef37f9a62c7)
   [ERROR] :  
   [ERROR] :  You can either select a version of these modules where the conflicting jar file is the same or you
   [ERROR] :  can try copying the jar file from one module's "lib" folder to the other module's "lib" folder.

   Yup, since the files for the play managers are all without versions (get stripped during module build) you don't ever know WHAT version of google-play.jar is the one being moved around.
   
   Appcelerator now has at least 3 modules using google-play.jar.
   
   The 'workaround' is NOT a viable mid/long term solution.</li>

   Here's a little secret... starting in Titanium SDK 3.2.0, someone sneaky added the ability for modules to have hooks. That means a module *could* use a hook to check and download a dependency (like a jar file) and place it in the appropriate location (like the lib folder) during build, but before compiling begins. Hmm...</li>

   Tracking architecture issue with TIMODOPEN-420.
   Closing this ticket as duplicate of TIMODOPEN-417.
