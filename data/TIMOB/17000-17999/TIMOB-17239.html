<h3>Description</h3>

The iOS build script copies an Xcode project into the build dir and performs a bunch of string replacements. This introduces issues with naming things such as the targets. For example, you cannot have a \ [ ] { } ( ) . + or * in the target name. You also cannot have the word "titanium" in the app name. We simply need to properly escape the app name.

The change needs to take place around <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/blob/master/iphone/cli/commands/_build.js#L2002-L2014." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/blob/master/iphone/cli/commands/_build.js#L2002-L2014.</a> There may also need to be some changes in project.pbxproj template.

   Proposed solution: <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/5854." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/5854.</a> It is suggested that there may be a better way.</li>

   I don't think we should allow this. The tooling should be smart enough to properly generate a valid build target name which is populated in the Info.plist. So the problem is in the Xcode project files. I'm adjusting this ticket accordingly.</li>

   [~hansknoechel] I don't think this is a problem anymore. In Summer 2015 when adding support for Watch apps, the iOS build should support any project name (including "titanium") as well as any character. I believe this ticket can be marked resolved.</li>
