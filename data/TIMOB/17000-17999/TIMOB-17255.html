<h3>Description</h3>

1. navigate to <a href="http://builds.appcelerator.com/index.html#3_3_X" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://builds.appcelerator.com/index.html#3_3_X</a>
2. look at the titles for the builds

results: Note that the text string has "Tizen" in it (for example - OS X (iOS, Android, Mobile Web, BlackBerry, Tizen)

expected - we have removed Tizen from the builds, there should not be a reference to it. This is a public facing page.

   now the old builds (pre 3.3.0) have not reference to tizen. I can open a new bug for that or leave this one open. reopening</li>

   [~thomashuelbert] The builds site can either display Tizen or not display Tizen for ALL builds (for a specific branch). We do not have a proper release/download management system where we actually catalog the release the products contained in the release.
   
   So this ticket shall remain reopened until it's resolved won't fix or it is fixed in a long, long time.</li>
<li>Chris Barber 2014-07-21

   The platforms listed for each build on the builds site are static and have nothing to do with the actual contents. We need builds to contain additional information such as these platforms and we simply do not have that information. Since we will likely never fix this until we completely replace the builds site, I'm resolving this as won't fix.</li>

   Closing ticket as Tizen is no longer supported.</li>
