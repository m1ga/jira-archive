<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Problem description</h4>
Using Alloy, LiveView changes are applied to the last opened and running app.
Using a Titanium Classic app, it works as expected on all the running app/devices.

This is how Alloy was working also using LiveView 1.0.3, so it is not a regression.

<h4>Steps to reproduce</h4>
1. Create an Alloy new project, enable LiveView and run (for example on Android)
2. Change some code (for example a label)
Result: app runs and LiveView works as expected. Changes are applied correctly.
3. Build run on another device/platform (for example, iOS)
Result: app runs and LiveView works as expected in the last opened app (iOS). After changing code, on the previous one (on Android, in our example), the app seems to refresh, but no changes are being applied.
