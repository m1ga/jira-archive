<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Description:</h4>
1. We are seeing an issue where CLI times out even though the emulator launches before the set timeout interval in ti config. 
I have my android.emulatorStartTimeout set to 5 min.

2. We saw that when an android device is connected the emulator times out, I also saw when the build before is a device build then it fails for me. I am not sure if this is the exact reason here, we are investigating more into it.

3. If we run adb kill-server & build the project for android emulator the the emulator launches & the app installs successfully.

3. As of now 2 people(me and [~oromero] )in the QE team has experienced the timing out issue.

   Verified the fix.
   
   Tried with multiple emulators scenarios. 
   CLI detects the emulator properly & launches the app successfully. It does not timeout even if the emulator is started.
   
   Closing.
   
   Environment:
   Appc Studio : 3.3.0.201407101409

   Alloy : 1.4.0-rc5
   CLI - 3.3.0-rc4
   Code Processor: 1.1.1
   Android emulators: 4.4.2 , 4.2.2, 4.3, 4.1.2 </li>
