<h3>Description</h3>

When running an Android build, it displays:

<code><pre>
[TRACE] Package manager is started
</pre></code>

which has bad grammar. Should be:

<code><pre>
[TRACE] Package manager has started
</pre></code>

Then if ADB install fails, it will display:

<code><pre>
[DEBUG] Package manager not started yet, trying again in 2000ms...
</pre></code>

This is confusing since ADB install will not start until the system_server process is running which assumes the package manager has started. It needs to display:

<code><pre>
[DEBUG] ADB install failed because package manager service is still starting, trying again in 2000ms...
</pre></code>

   To test, build an Android app (probably for emulator) and watch the output. You may need a REALLY slow machine and an ARM emulator to see the second message.</li>

   I can confirm that the first message (Package manager has started) is correctly displayed. Despite repeated attempts, the build/install always worked so I never saw message number two. It's in the code, so I'm sure it's going to work as described.</li>

   Verified the fix.
   
   The correct verbiage is seen in studio logs:
   <code><pre>[TRACE] :  Package manager has started</pre></code>
   &
   <code><pre>[DEBUG] :  ADB install failed because package manager service is still starting, trying again in 2000ms...</pre></code>
   
   Closing.
