   Any ETA on this?</li>
<li>Ingo Muschenetz 2014-10-06

   It is on our roadmap, but no current ETA.</li>
<li>Matt Silverman 2014-10-06

   Thanks for the reply Ingo.  I know this is a long shot, but if our goal is simply to post calories to a user's food log on HealthKit, is there any workaround do a simple task like that before you have the full blown HealthKit integration ready?  If you are not sure, then no worries at all.  </li>
<li>Food Facts 2015-02-06

   Is Titanium going to support Health Kit?  Last message I see here was posted back in October and iOS 8 has been out for some time now.  We are into February 2015 now. Are we going to have support in the API to write code against this?
   
   This has been an unfortunate miss as it is hard to extend into Health Kit unless programming directly in Xcode.

   Might be interesting if you can't wait for official implementation:

   Hi,
   My company would like to know if this feature will be implemented in the future and when.
   Could you please give us this information? Thank you</li>
<li>Hans Knöchel 2015-06-16

   The above mentioned module (<a href="https://github.com/olofmagnusson/healthkit-titanium-module)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/olofmagnusson/healthkit-titanium-module)</a> covers the API pretty good, did you give it a try?</li>
<li>Davide Fiocchi 2015-06-16

   No, I didn't yet. I gave a brief look, it seems good but we are interested in the official implementation. 
   Thank you anyway for your suggestion</li>

    I've tried integrating the mentioned Healthkit module but get: 
    
    [ERROR] 2015-06-16 22:05:19.534 xcodebuild[78206:462443]  DeveloperPortal: Using pre-existing current store at URL (file:///Users/ketan/Library/Developer/Xcode/DeveloperPortal%206.3.1.db).
    [ERROR] ** BUILD FAILED **

    [ERROR] (2 failures)
    
    It seems that the module was built against 3.4.1 - I've tried rebuilding it against 4.0.0 - and am not getting any joy. Has anyone got it working/building against 3.5.1.GA or 4.0.0.GA ?</li>
<li>Davide Fiocchi 2015-06-17

    Are you trying on simulator? I've just tried with a device and it worked (building against 3.5.1.GA).</li>
<li>Ketan Majmudar 2015-06-17

    Yeah, trying on the simulator. I've managed to build it against the device directly (if I deploy from XCode, this was with building against Ti SDK 4.0.0.GA) I've not tested much with it yet, but enough to get the auth screen showing.
    
    As the sim has the Health app, i'm wondering if the module needs some updating to support it. Also you need to manually add entitlement file via XCode too, not tried to build without it.
    
    At least i'm unblocked and can do some dev with the use of this, but relying on device deployment only is a bit of a bottleneck, grateful that the module exists though.</li>
<li>michael warnes 2015-07-03

    why would a module work on the device and not the simulator, what setting in Xcode would effect this? Not being able to debug this code is a major problem.</li>
<li>michael warnes 2015-07-10

    there is a work around.
    
    add healthkit capabilities to the titananium iphone project in the relevant sdk using xcode
    
    amend the _build.js file so it copies across the [yourapp].entitlements file as part of the build process
    
    I have got this module running successfully in debug on a simuulator for 3.4.1 and 4.0.0 SDKs</li>
<li>Fokke Zandbergen 2015-07-10

    You can add the capabilities via <code>tiapp.xml</code>:
    
    <code><pre>
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <ti:app xmlns:ti="<a href="http://ti.appcelerator.org" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://ti.appcelerator.org</a>">
      <ios>
        <plist>
          <dict>
            <key>UIRequiredDeviceCapabilities</key>
            <array>
              <string>healthkit</string>
            </array>
    ...
    </pre></code>
    
    You can put your custom <code>Entitlements.plist</code> file in your project root and as from Ti 4.0.0.GA it will be used instead of generating one by Titanium.</li>
<li>michael warnes 2015-07-10

    but you still need a ['yourapp'].entitlements file present for your app to compile</li>
<li>Fokke Zandbergen 2015-07-10

    Are you 100% sure? See <a href="https://community.appcelerator.com/topic/1596/apple-healthkit-integration/11" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://community.appcelerator.com/topic/1596/apple-healthkit-integration/11</a></li>
<li>michael warnes 2015-07-10

    well it's the only way I could get it to compile, if you look at the files that are created by xocde when you add the healthkit capability one of them is [yourapp].entitlements, this is additional to the entitlements.plist.</li>
<li>michael warnes 2015-07-10

    in fact if you look at the comment I posted at <a href="https://community.appcelerator.com/topic/1596/apple-healthkit-integration/11" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://community.appcelerator.com/topic/1596/apple-healthkit-integration/11</a> .....(in fact it was me that raised it)
    
    ...I'm using the 3.4.1 SDK so I can use Ti-Inspector. It appeared that the Entitlements.plist and the <myapp>.entitlements files were not copied to the build directory for the simulator.
    
    Once I added lines to copy these 2 files it started working.
    
    Are you running a clean before building? and are you debugging in the simulator? which SDK are you using?
    
    ...you can see there are 2 files required</li>
<li>michael warnes 2015-07-10

    but in 4.0.0 the plist file is handled by titanium, however the custom entitlements file is not</li>
<li>Fokke Zandbergen 2015-07-10

    As of 4.0.0.GA it should use the custom entitlements.</li>
<li>Ketan Majmudar 2015-09-16

    Any movement on official support for this yet? I see there is a beta module in the appcelerator labs section.</li>

    Resolving this issue, since our developers can use the HealthKit module from [our Labs](<a href="http://labs.appcelerator.com/)." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://labs.appcelerator.com/).</a> </li>
<li>Yanko Valera 2018-01-23

    Hi, the labs URL is not opening anymore.
    
    Could you please pointing in the right direction for integrating HealthKit?
    
    Regards</li>

    Cleaning up older fixed issues. If this issue should not have been closed as fixed, please reopen.</li>
