<h3>Description</h3>

In addition to the X and Y properties, views in the Android L Developer Preview have a Z property. This new property represents the elevation of a view, which determines:

The size of the shadow - Views with higher Z values cast bigger shadows.
The drawing order - Views with higher Z values appear on top of other views.

We could use this instead of sorting the views manually like we do now.

   We can also consider adding animations for elevations of views.
   
   There is also a section on clipping views, and we may be able to replace our current implementation with that.</li>

   Does anyone have an update on this? Elevation and shadows are a key facet of the Android L design philosophy and I'm disappointed to see that 6 months after the release of Android L, this still appears to have not been addressed.</li>

   Adding support for animation of elevation is another issue. This does not yet work with Ti.UI.Animation. </li>

   Closing ticket as fixed, if there are any problems, please file a new ticket.</li>
