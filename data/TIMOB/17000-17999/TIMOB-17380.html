   Can not reproduce the exact issue with iOS 8 beta 5 . i can see the <code>OK</code> Button and i am able to dismiss it. but the text itself does not scroll. 
   
   UIAlertVIew and UIActionSheet(aka uioptionDialog) might be acting weird due to major apple refactors going on in iOS 8. Going to keep the ticket open till we can resolve these issues correctly.</li>

   Was able to reproduce the same issue with the native app. attaching native app. Keeping ticket open as we might have to re-write alertDialog</li>

   For now this looks like a Apple bug.
   Tried using UIAlertController and was able to reproduce the same issue
   
   I have created a thread in the apple dev forum <a href="https://devforums.apple.com/thread/239772" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://devforums.apple.com/thread/239772</a>
   and with bugtracker with apple #17936331 
   
   We should revisit this issue with Xcode 6 GM. </li>

   Resolving ticket as Invalid as there is now a new version of Kitchen Sink available and we no longer support the version which relates to this ticket.</li>
