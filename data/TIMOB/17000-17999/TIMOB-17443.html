   Do you have a suggestion on what we should call it? Or is it a parameter passed to the create command?</li>

   Ingo,
   
   I'm not sure if this is directed at me, but since I requested the feature I'll chime in. I think passing in a parameter would make the most sense. Maybe for android there could be a switchType parameter and it could be set to 'toggle' or 'switch'. I don't think a new command makes sense since its already called createSwitch and we want the switch. If you made a createToggle command and modified createSwitch there could be backwards compatibility issues so I think having a new parameter passed in makes the most sense. If the parameter is not set then it would default to the 'toggle' state to preserve backwards compatibility. 
   
   I hope that helps,
   Travis</li>

   The "slider" style switch button was implemented in 2014 by [TIMOB-14178]. Can be seen in our docs here...
