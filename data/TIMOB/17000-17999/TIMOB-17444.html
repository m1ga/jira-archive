   Thanks for your new feature report. The Platform team will be setting the priority on this. </li>

   I'm not sure why we'd do this. crypto-js hasn't been maintained in years. Worse, others have forked it and it's hard to say which is the better implementation. Since crypto-js is a JavaScript implementation, we'll leave it to users to drop in the crypto package of their choice into their projects.</li>

   Closing ticket with reference to the previous comments.</li>
