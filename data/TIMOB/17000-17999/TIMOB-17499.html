<h3>Description</h3>

1. Create WP81 unit and performance tests for JavaScriptCore that integrates with the CI server setup by Allen.

   A comment from Matt:
   
   "To use JSBench: It means we have to host JavaScriptCore in WebKit, which means building WebKit (which is basically Safari) for WP81. If this is easy (we haven't tried) then we should use JSBench. If not, then we'll need to create our own benchmark suite."
   
   I'm curious if we can't use SunSpider instead (see <a href="http://www.sencha.com/blog/javascript-engines-how-to-compile-them/)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.sencha.com/blog/javascript-engines-how-to-compile-them/)</a> as that what's they suggest as a mechanism. It should has to demonstrate that the engine is much slower on Windows Phone vs OS X, and that we can make sure work we do to fix Windows brings those benchmarks closer together.
