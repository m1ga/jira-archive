<h3>Description</h3>

Steps:

0. Install CLI v3.3.0.
1. Run <code>ti create</code>, answering prompts as desired.
2. After <code>\[INFO]  Project created successfully...</code> message, wait for command to exit back to shell.

Results: Command exits back to shell after 2-3 minutes. 
Expected: Command exits to shell immediately after "success" message.

I don't see this problem with the 3.2.3 CLI.

   Are there any files in <code>~/.titanium/events</code>?</li>
<li>Tim Statler 2014-08-15

   Yes, about 170 of them. Should I attach them?</li>
<li>Chris Barber 2014-08-15

   Naw, just kill all node processes and wipe all files in that directory. Make sure that you're on Titanium CLI 3.3.0.</li>

   That did it, thanks Chris. Should I close this out, or is it something to investigate further? Edit: To clarify, I meant could this happen to someone else, and can we address it in the code, or is it a doc/support issue?</li>
<li>Chris Barber 2014-08-15

   I guess we'll never know. It should not happen if you're using Titanium CLI 3.3.0. If you don't have a reproducible test case and you're not experiencing the problem, then this ticket can be resolved, probably as cannot reproduce.</li>
