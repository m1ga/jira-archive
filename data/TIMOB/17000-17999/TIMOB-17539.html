<h3>Description</h3>

I found that attaching a 'swipe' event handler to a window with the goal of allowing swiping left and right to change content is having the unintended side effect of preventing the native scroll behavior on a table view contained in the window on Android.
Normally when you swipe down (fling) on a table view, there's some inertia and the table view keeps scrolling for a little bit. When there is a 'swipe' event handler on a table view and you swipe down on a table view, as soon as you lift your finger off the screen the table view motion stops. There is no inertia. The scrolling stops as soon as the finger is lifted, making it hard to scroll through a long list.
iOS doesn't seem affected. The swipe handler works and native scroll works as expected.

   I have this problem too. I have created a demo project at [<a href="https://github.com/ClinicalSoftwareSolutions/DemoBug/tree/swipe_prevents_list_scrolling" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/ClinicalSoftwareSolutions/DemoBug/tree/swipe_prevents_list_scrolling</a>] to demonstrate the problem
   
   My environment is Ti SDK 3.3.0.GA, OSX 10.9, Android 4.4.4 and tested on Samsung S5 hardware + Genymotion S5,S4 and S3 emulator. There is also a report in the forums about the same problem on a LG L2
   
   This demo project also demonstrates another bug. Swipe left and right does not seem to be detected.

   Just to say that this has been labelled with tableView, but effects the listview component too.
   Thanks</li>

   Make sure that we don't consume the fling event by returning true.

   The above PR is a suitable workaround. We won't merge it in master as it will break apps that rely on 'swipe' being consumed.</li>
