<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Problem Description</h4>

Settings.bundle pages that display long text do not show the top of the text, or anywhere near the top of the next.  Attempts by the user to pull the page down to see the clipped portion fail to move the content far enough down to see the missing portion.  The text content bottom portion can be viewed with ease.

It would appear the "ScrollView" holding the content has a negative margin that goes above the window itself.  Obviously this setting is not available to change.

This problem does not exist on iOS6 it is only showing on iOS7 (no tests have been performed on iOS8).

When shortening the content to a few words - the content is perfectly viewable.

The problem does not occur with apps from Apple that also use long text in the Settings app entries.

Example Settings.bundle plist files; (content is random gibberish)

   Any movement on this one @Ingo?  I know everything has been 3.4 focused so I honoured that focus, but right now this is causing me issues.  T&C, privacy policies and more are simply unusable due to this issue.</li>
<li>Ingo Muschenetz 2014-09-30

   I've placed it in an upcoming sprint. We'll re-review it shortly.</li>

   Tested on iOS8. Cuts off as well. 
   After some investigation, this is an Apple bug.

   The workaround is, replace
   <key>Title</key>
   with
   <key>FooterText</key>
   
   Using this workaround, long.plist works. (see screenshot)</li>
<li>Chee Kiat Ng 2014-10-07

   add screenshot using FooterText instead of Title</li>
<li>Malcolm Hollingsworth 2014-10-08

   I have confirmed the work around works for apps which are complied for iOS 7 and it does "work-around".
   
   I will have to check for the iOS 8 apps, but I do ot have time to review just now.  Thanks for getting it this far.</li>

   Closing ticket with reference to the previous comments.</li>
