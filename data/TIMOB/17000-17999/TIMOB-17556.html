<h3>Description</h3>

Be able to use Titanium to write a widget, or at least bundle a widget extension for the notification screen and interact with it.

Also, some use case examples in your docs would help immensely for it.

   Do you have more information on what you mean by this feature?</li>

   Hi,
   
   Yes. in the new iOS 8 SDK, we can write extensions and bridge them into the native xCode app to do things like show a widget on the dashboard that would open into the app.
   
   Wonder if it is possible with the current infrastructure, if so, how? An addition to the docs would be great.
   Else, add this to the upcoming Titanium SDK.

   How does that relate to TIMOB-17335?</li>

   I'm unsure if it's the same thing. I work exclusively in Titanium, so an xcode developer on your side will need to investigate.</li>

   A few things to ponder on:
   - An app extension target must include the arm64 (iOS) or x86_64 architecture (OS X) in its Architectures build settings or it will be rejected by the App Store. 
   
   - App extensions are for developing:
   Today Widget: Get a quick update or perform a quick task in the Today view of Notification Center
   (A Today extension is called a widget)
   Share: Post to a sharing website or share content with others
   Action: Manipulate or view content originating in a host app
   Photo Editing: Edit a photo or video within the Photos app
   Document Provider: Provide access to and manage a repository of files.
   Custom Keyboard: Replace the iOS system keyboard with a custom keyboard for use in all apps

   As cool as this would be, i'm going to wager a guess that this is a MAJOR undertaking and prob wont come about until Ti 4.x... app extensions are basically separate apps packaged in a special way... Ti 3.x I would assume to be too large and inefficient for such a lightweight task... with Hyperloop though I would assume this to be a more realistic thing to make happen. But who knows, maybe Appc will be able to pull out some crazy mojo and make this happen before that.</li>

   Is there any way to add today extension? </li>

    This issue is fixed since Release 5.3.0 (TIMOB-17335). There are guides for [General Extensions](<a href="https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides2/Integrate+a+Native+iOS+App+Extension+or+WatchKit+App)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides2/Integrate+a+Native+iOS+App+Extension+or+WatchKit+App)</a> and [SiriKit Extensions](<a href="https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides2/Creating+iOS+Extensions%3A+Siri+Intents)." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides2/Creating+iOS+Extensions%3A+Siri+Intents).</a> There are also plans to support extensions in pure JS, please follow TIMOB-23707 for more infos regarding that. Thx!</li>
