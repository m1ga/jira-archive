<h3>Description</h3>

Description:
Running "ti build -p iOS -T simulator -D" command doesn't prompt the user for the deployment type value and build project with its default value.
Running "ti build -p iOS -T" command doesn't prompt the user for the target value and build project with its default value..
Running "ti build -p iOS -T simulator -S" command doesn't prompt the user for the iOS simulator version and build project with its default value. 

The issue is not reproducible with CLI 3.3.0 and Titanium SDK version 3.3.0.GA.
With CLI 3.3.0, it prompts for the input value based on the option specified with "ti build -p iOS" command.
Hence marked as a regression.

STEPS TO REPRODUCE
1. Open a terminal window
2. Create a project and you have to "cd" to this project to be able to run command "build"
3. Run "ti build -p iOS -T simulator -D" command.
4. Run "ti build -p iOS -T" command.
5. Run "ti build -p iOS -T simulator -S" command.


EXPECTED RESULT
The CLI should prompt for the input value from user based on the iOS build
option given with the command.

ACTUAL RESULT
The CLI is not prompting for the input value for any of the mentioned options and building the project.

   In the case of <code>ti build -p ios -T simulator -D</code>, since you're not specifying a deploy type, it defaults to whatever the default for the target is.
   
   In the case of <code>ti build -p ios -T</code>, since you're not specifying the target, it defaults to the simulator.
   
   In the case of <code>ti build -p ios -T simulator -S</code>, since you're not specifying the simulator version, it defaults to the ios version.
   
   In TiSDK 3.4.0 we now treat missing option values as "" (empty string) instead of true. This prevents a slew of errors when handling a boolean when a string was expected. Because you are omitting the values, the CLI is using the defaults as it should.</li>

   Thanks Chris.I have noted it.
   Can you please let me know where I can find the complete details?
   As there are still some options when ran without value with TiSDK 3.4.0, prompts for the input from user.For this options, the default value is not set.  </li>

   [~cbarber]I have executed the below command for building iOS application.
   
   titanium build -p ios -F ipad -Y ipad -I
   
   With the above, CLI doesn't prompt for iOS SDK version. Builds the application with default value.
   With --ios-version flag, its prompting.
   
   What should be the expected behavior with the below command?Should it prompt for iOS SDK?
   titanium build -p ios -F ipad -Y ipad -I</li>
