   I'm not sure we needed both tickets. I assume the underlying issue is similar.</li>

   [~ingo],
   
   Just giving more clarification on the above tickets.
   With this ticket TIMOB-17607, CLI  just gives error message with the above specified options and prompt the user for the input value.After user provides the input value, CLI reads that value and project builds successfully.
   
   With the other ticket TIMOB-17605, CLI does not read the platform value provided by user for the prompt and gives error message and stop the project building process.So the user will not be able to build the project in this case.</li>

   Follow the <code>STEPS TO REPRODUCE</code> listed above, no error message if the option has command prompt available.</li>

   I have actually run into this issue myself where I type a long 2-3 line command and forget to specify an option value. Since I get the error message, I know exactly why I am being prompted for an already specified option. If we remove this error message then I have no idea why I am being prompted for an option I have already specified. 
   
   I would recommend keeping this error message as it is very helpful. I am resolving this ticket as invalid but I am open to discussion if you disagree. It is really easy to "fix" these type of issues but we need to take a step back and understand the user experience.</li>

   You have a valid point! 
   The error prompt might seem a little obtrusive initially, but it has been a useful reminder. It didn't come across my mind that this could be by design. :)

   I agree that it should be consistent. Either we display a message in all cases or we don't display it at all. I have never used "V" option. Is it a shorthand version of "--developer-name"?</li>
<li>Feon Sua Xin Miao 2014-12-09

   Yup, it's required when target is device. </li>
<li>Khushbu Agrawal 2014-12-09

   [~ngupta] Yes, -V option is a shorthand version for specifying developer name for iOS.</li>

    Closing ticket as invalid.</li>
