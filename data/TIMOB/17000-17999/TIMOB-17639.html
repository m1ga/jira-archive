*Steps to reproduce*
With the following combinations, build and run the test case and click on the window to open the dialog.

- SDK 3.4 / iOS8 / iPhone: OK
- SDK 3.4 / iOS8 / iPad: *Error*
- SDK 3.3 / iOS7.1 / iPhone: OK
- SDK 3.3 / iOS7.1 / iPad: OK

*Test case*
<code><pre>
var win = Ti.UI.createWindow({
  backgroundColor: 'white'
});
win.addEventListener('click', function(e) {
  Ti.UI.createOptionDialog({
    options: ['a', 'b']
  }).show();
});
win.open();
</pre></code>

   A work around (documented way <a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#</a>!/api/Titanium.UI.OptionDialog-method-show) is to specify a view and rect when showing the dialog:
   <code><pre>
   Ti.UI.createOptionDialog({
       options: ['a', 'b']
   }).show({view:win, rect:{width:1, height:1, x: 100, y: 200});
   </pre></code>
   For rect only x and y are used (see <a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#</a>!/api/showParams).

   [~ludolphus] you are right, (it doesn't even need <code>rect</code> in order to work), but of course - as documented - it should also work without and then show centered.
   
   I guess the title of the ticket should be *iOS8: Ti.UI.OptionDialog.show() doesn't work without view-property on iPad*</li>

   This might be fixed in the iOS8 GM:
   
   > To use an action sheet-style UIAlertController on iPad, the sourceView of the alert controller's popoverPresentationController must be set.

   Since iOS 8 GM it now works again. The ticket can be closed.</li>
<li>Shameer Jan 2014-09-11

   This issue does not reproduce with 
   iOS 7.1 
   TiSDK 3.4.0 
   Appcelerator Studio, build: 3.3.0.201407111535 
   Titanium Command-Line Interface, CLI version 3.3.0,</li>
<li>Fokke Zandbergen 2014-09-11

   [~shameerj] that's correct because the ticket was for iOS 8 beta 5 and as you can read in the comment above yours it was an Apple-bug that is now fixed in GM.</li>
<li>Ingo Muschenetz 2014-09-12

   Vishal wishes to keep a ticket open to reflect the next to add a view property, so keeping this open for the moment. There might be something related that needs to be fixed for 3.4.1.</li>
