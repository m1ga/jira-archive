<h3>Description</h3>

Each time I compile an app using Ti SDK 3.4 and target a physical device I am asked to provide my Mac credentials before the process will place the app on the device.

This occurs after the "image optimisation" console output and before any mention of the app being transferred to the device.

The device is an iPhone 5 running iOS8b5.

The dialog box context is as follows;

  OS X wants to make changes.  Type an administrator's name and password to allow this.
  OS X wants to use the "System" keychain.

The only two buttons offered are 'Deny' & 'Allow'.  There is no option to always allow.

Provided the correct details are entered the app will successfully transfer to the device and does not appear to suffer any issues directly related to the security dialog.

   I added my iPhone Developer cert to the "login" keychain, then ran a device build and found a similar dialog:

   When I click "Allow", it proceeds to install the application as expected. When I click "Always Allow", it will never prompt me again.
   
   I moved my cert to the "System" keychain, but unfortunately I had already allowed the cert and no longer prompts me. I suspect the "System" keychain version would not show the "Always Allow" button, but I'm not certain.
   
   I really don't think this is a Titanium bug. We've seen similar alerts in the past. If you move the cert to your "login" keychain and click "Always Allow", then you should never have this problem again.
   
   I'm going to resolve this as invalid. Please re-open if this turns out to be a valid issue.</li>

   I can confirm the problem was entirely due to the "iPhone Developer" certificate having been placed into the 'system' folder by default, rather than the 'login' folder which it has now been moved to.
   
   Not sure why 'system' was chosen as the default dialog, or if there was some instruction I missed with a clean Yosemite (or simply any OSX) - but either way dragging the the certificate from the 'system' folder and dropping it in the 'login' folder has resolved the problem, it just required one final set of user name and passwords to confirm the move and now there are no further request permissions during any app compiles.</li>

   Attempted to reproduce on:
   
   Mac OSX 10.10
   Appcelerator Studio, build: 3.4.0.201409032106
   Titanium SDK build: 3.4.0.v20140907150914
   Titanium CLI, build: 3.4.0-beta
   Alloy: 1.5.0-beta2
   
   Was unable to reproduce the above issue and did not see any dialog asking me for my mac credentials before installing to device.</li>

   Thanks for following up [~core13], we already were trying to reproduce, hence the later comment from [~eharris].
   
   We'll close this for now and key an eye open for this issue especially with Yosemite.</li>
