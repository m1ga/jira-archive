   We think we may not _need_ this for 3.4.0. If that is determined not to be the case, pull into 3.4.0</li>

   My tests show it looks like having a launch image with the right name convention doesn't work anymore to have iOS recognise apps as being iPhone 6 compatible.
   
   It should be easy to just generate an Asset Catalog bundle with the images and a JSON file.
   
   Although launch file support will not be needed, I guess we still have to get rid of how the RootViewController is currently simulating a launch screen.</li>

   Is this planned for the next release?</li>
<li>Tim Poulsen 2015-02-05

   [~ygbr] We're actively investigating better solutions for launch files and icons. I don't know if the changes would be in the next release however. I've linked a bunch of related tickets. Keep an eye on this one and those for updates.</li>

   [~cng] that ticket is only about launch images, which is different from XIB-based launch files.</li>

   [~skypanther] This feature was exposed in 5.2.0 as part of TIMOB-19694, so can we close this issue?</li>
<li>Tim Poulsen 2016-04-25

    Certainly. Thanks for asking.</li>
<li>Hans Knöchel 2016-04-25

    Closing in favor of TIMOB-19694</li>
