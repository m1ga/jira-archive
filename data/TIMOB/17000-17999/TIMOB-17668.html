<h3>Description</h3>

The previous instance of iOS simulator is not killed and the second instance is created when one of the iOS simulator is iPhone 6/iPhone 6 plus and the second instance is any other simulator apart from those two.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a project
2. Run the project through studio or CLI on iPhone 6 simulator
3. Once the project runs on the above simulator, try to run the same project on any simulator other than iPhone 6/ iPhone 6 plus

Actual Result:
A second simulator instance is created.

Expected Result:
There should be only one instance on simulator.

   I tried a number of combinations including leaving the simulator running and couldn't reproduce the problem.
   
   If the issue still persists, reset your simulator. If that doesn't clear things up, then please reopen this ticket.</li>

   Tried to reset the settings and contents of the simulators. However, still get the issue of first instance not being killed and instead a second instance of simulator coming up when trying to rebuild the project.
   
   The issue occurs from both studio and CLI. Following is what I tried today:
   1. Create a default project through CLI
   2. Build the project for iPhone 6 (v8.0) simulator
   "ti build -p ios -T simulator -C 567BD2FC-3AA3-4C1D-9212-8EE3C171DAD8"
   The iPhone 6 simulator launches and the app is opened.
   3. With the iPhone 6 simulator still open, now build the project for iPhone 5S (v8.0) simulator.
   "ti build -p ios -T simulator -C 6AAE00ED-3835-4C38-86B9-792318D47F35"
   It launches the second instance of simulator. However, the second project build fails. But we still have two instances of simulator launched.
   
   Tried on 4 different machines. All on same environment. The issue reproduces on three of them and works fine on one of the machine. </li>

   Still can't reproduce. Let's see if the QE team here at HQ can reproduce.</li>
<li>Ingo Muschenetz 2014-09-12

   @skypather to try to reproduce.</li>

   We were not able to reproduce in-house via Studio or via CLI. Repeated three times and still was not able to reproduce.
   
   Tested on:
   
   Appcelerator Studio, build: 3.4.0.201409112242
   SDK build: 3.4.0.v20140912104915 
   CLI: 3.4.0-rc2
   Alloy: 1.5.0-rc
   Xcode: 6 GM Seed
   Device: iphone 6 simulator (8.0), iphone 6 plus simulator (8.0), iphone 5s simulator (8.0)</li>
<li>Tim Poulsen 2014-09-12

   I am unable to reproduce this:
   
   SDK 3.4.0.v20140910235714 (RC)
   CLI 3.4.0-rc
   Alloy 1.5.0-rc
   Appcelerator Studio 3.4.0.201409101253 (RC)
   
   Steps:
   
   With new, Classic project, build for iOS8/iPhone 6 simulator. Leave that simulator open, build for iOS8/iPhone 5 simulator. Works as expected. I also tried building for the iPhone 6+ simulator, and then building for the 4, 4s, and 5s simulators with iOS8 in succession. All worked as expected. I also tried building to the iPhone 6+ sim, and then building for the same iPhone simulators listed previously but this time under iOS 7.1. Again, all worked as expected.

   Given the difficulty in reproducing this, moving it out of 3.4.0. We may revisit it for 3.4.1 or later.</li>
<li>Chris Barber 2014-09-25

   Since nobody can reproduce except the original reporter, I'm resolving this as cannot reproduce.</li>
