<h3>Description</h3>

When trying to submit an app to the AppStore with Xcode 6 GM an error occurs saying 'rsync failed'. Clicking the 'View Log' button does not show any logs, so I cannot provide more information. I googled the issue and saw at least 1 other having a similar problem on the dev Q&A site.

The current workaround seems to be to exclude uploading the DSYM file to receive symbolicated crash logs from Apple.

   It would be very nice to have better crash reports in iTunes Connect if we could get this working for Titanium apps.
   
   Also for new devs it would be good if their first submit of a Titanium app would not result in an error when having this option enabled (which it is by default).</li>

   After investigation, it is found that Apple has changed the folder name that contains the dSYM file in the xarchive in Xcode 6, resulting in this error.
   Made changes accordingly so that apps can be submitted with app symbols.

   Closing ticket as fixed. Created and Added the app details at Apple developer account. Then Verified by packaging the app for Distribute Apple iTunes Store. At Xcode Organizer window, selected the packaged app and click "validate", leaving the box checked to "Include app symbols" . It's validated without showing any error for DSYM file.
   
   Tested on: 
   1. Mac OSX Yosemite 10.10
   2. Appcelerator Studio, build: 3.4.1.201410281743
   3. Titanium SDK, build:  3.5.0.v20141125154115
   4. Titanium CLI, build: 3.4.1
   5. Alloy: 1.5.1
   6. Xcode 6.1
   7. iOS SDK 8.1
   8. iPhone 5s with iOS 8.1
