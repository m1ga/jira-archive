<h3>Description</h3>

Description:

While doing some regression testing, I have come across an issue due to which I am unable to run number of CLI commands that takes input from user.
The issue is with hitting the enter key after giving the input data. Hitting the enter key will not take the cursor to next line.It is triggering a space on the terminal.Need to do CTR + c to come out of it.Hence not able to run some CLI commands like ti sdk select, ti setup, ti login etc. 

Test machine details:
Initially the system had the setup  CLI 3.4.0-rc3 and titanium SDK 3.4.0.v20140915175720.
Then, I have  only switched CLI to CLI 3.3.0 version and titanium SDK remains the same 3.4.0.v20140915175720.
Run the CLI "ti sdk select" command and faced the above mentioned issue with hitting the enter key.

STEPS TO REPRODUCE:
1. Install CLI 3.4.0-rc3 and titanium SDK 3.4.0.v20140915175720 on machine.The ti SDK is set to 3.4.0.v20140915175720 with CLI.
2. Install the CLI 3.3.0 and ti SDK will remain the same as 3.4.0.v20140915175720.
3. Run "ti setup" command.Then CLI prompts for various options, then enter the data, hit enter key.
4. Run "ti sdk select" command and choose the required sdk and hit the enter key.Make sure you are having more than one ti SDK installed on your system.
5. Run "ti login" command and enter the user name and hit the enter key.

EXPECTED RESULT:
3. The cursor should go to next line and CLI will prompt for the next input data.
4. The required SDK configuration should be set.
5. The cursor moves to next line and CLI should prompt for the password.

ACTUAL RESULT:
3. Hitting the enter key, triggers a space on terminal and not able to go to next prompt.
4. Hitting the enter key triggers a space and does not set the configured sdk.
5. Hitting the enter key does not take the cursor to next line for password prompt.Instead the enter key triggers a space on terminal.

Please refer the attached screenshots.
The issue is reproducible with other machines as well.

I have uninstalled the CLI and all the titanium sdk versions installed on my system.
Then freshly installed only titanium SDK 3.4.0.v20140915175720 and CLI 3.4.0-rc3.
But still facing the same issue with hitting the enter key with the mentioned CLI commands.The enter key is still triggering the space.
