<h3>Description</h3>

As far as I know, there's currently no method to catch and handle application crashes on Android.
For the app I'm currently developing I would like to implement the open source library ACRA ( <a href="http://acra.ch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://acra.ch/</a> ) which enables exactly this feature.
The library catches crashes and is able to send the catched data via email, post it to web forms, show a toast message to the user, etc.

I thought about creating a native module, but sadly this isn't possible, because ACRA needs to be added in the Application.java file, which gets generated by Titanium.

It would be great, if this feature could be enabled and configured inside the tiapp.xml.
The implementation is very easy.

If there is any other way of implementing it without editing core files, please let me know!
I don't want to break the possibility of updating, by manually changing the generation process.
