		"description": "As far as I know, there's currently no method to catch and handle application crashes on Android.\r\nFor the app I'm currently developing I would like to implement the open source library ACRA ( http://acra.ch/ ) which enables exactly this feature.\r\nThe library catches crashes and is able to send the catched data via email, post it to web forms, show a toast message to the user, etc.\r\n\r\nI thought about creating a native module, but sadly this isn't possible, because ACRA needs to be added in the Application.java file, which gets generated by Titanium.\r\n\r\nIt would be great, if this feature could be enabled and configured inside the tiapp.xml.\r\nThe implementation is very easy.\r\n\r\nIf there is any other way of implementing it without editing core files, please let me know!\r\nI don't want to break the possibility of updating, by manually changing the generation process.",
