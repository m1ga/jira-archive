<h3>Description</h3>

Geo Permissions support has been added in TIMOB-17638 . But other modules that interact with geo such as map or ibeacons need to be able to request geo permissions as well. Instead of copy/pasting code for each of these, it would be better to have a central place to request/permissions based on the keys added to the info.plist. Also need a delegate that gets called when the permissions requested are approved or rejected like 
<code><pre>
- (void)locationManager:(CLLocationManager *)manager didChangeAuthorizationStatus:(CLAuthorizationStatus)status
</pre></code>

We need to create an implementation that can be used by modules. We may also want to consider exposing something to javascript to allow developers to request this permissions, but I am not sure if this is necessary.
