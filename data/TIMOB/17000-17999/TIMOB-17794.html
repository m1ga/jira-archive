<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>I cant check if this is a regression as SDK 3.3.0.GA is not compatible with xcode 6.0.1</h4>

<h4>Description:</h4>
1. Replace the contents of app.js with the code below:
<code><pre>
var win1 = Titanium.UI.createWindow({  
    title:'Tab 1',
    backgroundColor:'#fff'
});

var emailDialog = Ti.UI.createEmailDialog();
emailDialog.open();

win1.open();
</pre></code>
2. Build for IOS 8 (this is device independent).

<h4>Actual Result:</h4>
1. The email dialog does not open in IOS 8.0.2 but opens fine on IOS 7.1.2.

<h4>Expected Result:</h4>
1. The email dialog should open in IOS 8.0.2.

   How does this relate to TIMOB-17708?</li>
<li>Lokesh Choudhary 2014-09-26

   I am not sure its related, but in TIMOB-17708 the issue is the message and the recipient(s) are not set in the email dialog & with this issue the email dialog does not come up at all, even for the code in TIMOB-17708.
   
   This is little confusing, if this issue existed then it would have be apparent while working on TIMOB-17708 unless there is a breakage later after the fix went in. </li>

   On my testings, the message and recipients did not show on the simulator for some reason, then dialog closed automatically. We now check if you're running on an iOS 8 simulator and if so we don't  show the dialog. We log a warning message instead.
   When I tested on the real device, everything worked as expected. Are you seeing anything different?
   
   <h4>Edit</h4>
   I tested this a week before this comment was written.</li>

   [~penrique]-- for me right now on both simulator & real device the email dialog does not come up.</li>

   Guys, its user error. My bad it skipped my mind that in IOS u need to sign in to your email account for the email dialog to show up.
   
   I signed in & now the email dialog comes up as expected.
   
   Closing.</li>
