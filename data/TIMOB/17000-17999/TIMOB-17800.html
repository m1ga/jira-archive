<h3>Description</h3>

The iOS Distribution progress continues after the project has been published (ad-hoc or iTunes Store) and halts the progress of other actions.

The issue occurs only when the currently selected Xcode is Xcode 6. Is does not happen when tested with XCode 5.1.1

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use Xcode select to switch to Xcode 6 GM/beta
2. Create a project
3. Select Publish > Distribute - Ad Hoc/Enterprise

Actual Result:
The project build and packaging is successful but the progress bar continues to show iOS Distribution in progress for a long time. Refer to attached screenshot.
With Xcode 5.1.1, the progress stops as soon as the console shows the success message for package.

   Tested environment
   Mac osx 10.9.4 Maverics
   Appcelerator Studio, build: 3.4.0.201409081810
   Titanium SDK, build: 3.4.0.v20140909222515
   acs@1.0.16
   alloy 1.5.0-rc
   install@0.1.7
   npm@1.4.23
   sudo@1.0.3
   titanium 3.4.0-rc
   titanium-code-processor@1.1.1
   Xcode6-Beta7
   
   VPC environment VPCtest-prod; development (can be selected from Distribute window)
   
   I cannot reproduce the issue, packaging the app for iOS Adhoc/Enterprise, using Appcelerator Studio both Global NavBar and the project's drop down menu options.
   Used projects with and without appcelerator services enablement.

   The issue seems to vary from system to system.
   I tried to reproduce the issue on four machines with same environment. On each machine tried the packaging at least 2-3 times.
   The first machine works absolutely fine. The second machine continues to show progress for at least 3-5 second after the packaging success message is shown. On other two machines, the progress continues for a long time like 5-10 mins beyond the package success message.</li>

   [~ssekhri] Look into the ~/.titanium/events and see how many files are in there. Can you back up that folder and erase it, and see if that fixes it?</li>
<li>Satyam Sekhri 2014-09-12

   Deleting the contents of the ~/.titanium/events folder resolves the issue on the two machines that were taking a long time for the build progress to finish.</li>
<li>Ingo Muschenetz 2014-09-12

   [~cbarber] FYI. If this is the case, what should we do next?</li>
<li>Chris Barber 2014-09-12

   I would restore the contents of the ~/.titanium/events directory, then close Appcelerator/Titanium Studio, then enable analytics debugging <code>ti config cli.analytics.debug true</code>, then build an app from the CLI (any platform, any target), then take ALL output including the analytics debug output and attach it to this ticket, then disable analytics debugging <code>ti config cli.analytics.debug false</code>.</li>
<li>Ingo Muschenetz 2014-09-16

   Any updates here?</li>
<li>Eric Merriman  2014-09-16

   [~ssekhri] Can you take a look at Chris' issue and try to reproduce?
   </li>
<li>Satyam Sekhri 2014-09-17

   Attached are the logs from CLI with the build command "ti build -p ios -T dist-adhoc" and analytics debug enabled.
   Environment:
   Mac OSX:10.9.4
   SDK: 3.4.0.v20140916151649
   Studio: 3.4.0.201409131030
   CLI: 3.4.0-rc4
   Xcode: Xcode 6 GM seed</li>
<li>Praveen Innamuri 2014-09-29

    Since the underlying issue is due to the unterminated node process, moving to CLI to investigate why did the node process still runs even after it finishes packaging the app.</li>
<li>Tim Poulsen 2015-02-18

    I am unable to reproduce this problem. Time to do an ad-hoc build is pretty consistently 34-35 seconds; I do not see any continued progress bar or other indication that processes are still running.
    
    OSX 10.10.2
    SDK 3.5.0.GA
    Appcelerator Studio 3.4.1.201410281743
    CLI 3.4.1 (also tested with current master, 3.6.0-dev)
    Xcode 6.1.1</li>
<li>Praveen Innamuri 2015-02-26

    Can not reproduce anymore with the latest versions of CLI/SDK and Studio.</li>
<li>Lee Morris 2017-03-28

    Ti SDK 6.0.3 GA
    Appc NPM 4.2.8
    Appc CLI 6.1.0
    Ti CLI 5.0.11
    Alloy 1.9.5
    Arrow 1.10.1
