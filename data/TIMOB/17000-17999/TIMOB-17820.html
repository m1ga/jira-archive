<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Description</h4>

When Xcode 6.1 is selected when attempting to build to an iOS 8.0 simulator the build fails with the error below
<code><pre>
[ERROR] Unable to find any Xcode installs that has iOS SDK 8.1 and iOS Simulator 8.0
</pre></code>

It appears that in Xcode6.1 Apple has *removed the option for an iOS 8.0 sim* as there is no option to create or build to a sim with 8.0 within Xcode itself and that this is the root cause of the issue. However when building to a simulator the option is given if Xcode 6.0.1 and Xcode 6.1 are present in the same folder, is 6.0.1 is removed from the folder then the simulator is not longer presented as an option.

When attempting to install to an iOS 8.0.2 device the build does not fail.

*Notes*
This will only occur if you have *both Xcode 6.0.1 and Xcode 6.1 installed in the applications folder*

This occurs on the GA release of Xcode 6.1. The only supported simulators in this release are iOS8.1 and iOS7.1

If Xcode 6.0.1 is set as the default with Xcode 6.1 installed then the option to build to an iOS 8.1 sim is given this then errors with 
<code><pre>
[ERROR] Unable to find any Xcode installs that has iOS SDK 8.0 and iOS Simulator 8.1
</pre></code>

<h4>Steps To Reproduce</h4>

1. Ensure that both Xcode 6.0.1 *AND* Xcode 6.1 are installed in Applications
2. Set your Xcode to 6.1 by installing it and using xcode-select -s
3. In the CLI with ios.autoSelectDevice set to false, type ti build -p ios -T simulator
4. When prompted to select a simulator, choose an iOS 8.0 sim

<h4>Actual Result</h4>

The build fails with the error above

<h4>Expected Result</h4>

There should not be an option to build with an iOS8.0 simulator if it is not supported by Xcode

   Need to defer this until we understand how this interacts with the appc-cli.</li>

   Not an issue anymore.</li>
