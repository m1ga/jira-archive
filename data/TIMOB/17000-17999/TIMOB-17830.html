<h4>Solution</h4>

The Titanium SDK should include a list of all known platform names to ensure we don't copy resources for deprecated platforms.

   [~sfeather], which Titanium SDK is specified in the tiapp.xml?</li>
<li>Stephen Feather 2014-10-08

   3.4.0.GA</li>
<li>Ewan Harris 2014-10-08

   I am unable to reproduce the issue on: 
   
   Mac OSX 10.9.5
   Appcelerator Studio, build: 3.4.0.201409261245
   Titanium SDK build: 3.4.0.GA
   Titanium CLI, build: 3.4.0
   Alloy: 1.5.1
   Xcode 6.0.1
   
   I built both an Alloy and a Classic project for dist-appstore and dist-adhoc from the CLI, in the .ipa files neither had a 'tizen' folder, I then added <target device="tizen">true</target> to the tiapp.xml for both projects along with the Tizen module and this had no effect upon the contents of the files.
   
   Are there any additional steps that you can think of that will help me reproduce the issue? Thanks for the report.</li>
<li>Stephen Feather 2014-10-08

   take a 3.3.x generated alloy project with tizen folders laying around (app/asset) comes to mind.
   
   Now we have to go clean up all the tizen crap littering our projects to that it doesn't make it into iOS (and i need to check android) binary packaging.</li>
<li>Chris Barber 2014-10-08

   [~eharris] Try creating a project with 3.2.0.GA, then build the app for iOS and notice that the Tizen folder is NOT copied to the final build.
   
   Then update the <sdk-version> in the tiapp.xml to 3.4.0.GA and build again for iOS. Notice the Tizen folder is copied.</li>

   I am able to reproduce the issue on: 
   
   Mac OSX 10.9.5
   Appcelerator Studio, build: 3.4.0.201409261245
   Titanium SDK build: 3.4.0.GA. 3.2.0.GA
   Titanium CLI, build: 3.4.0
   Alloy: 1.5.1
   Xcode 6.0.1
   
   Revisited and using the information from the above comments I am able to reproduce the issue, if a project has existing Tizen resources then these are included when the app is built for dist-appstore or dist-adhoc. Thanks for the help.</li>
<li>Chris Barber 2016-08-19

   This may seem like a non-issue being that Tizen is dead, but actually, this is a bug. We only identify folders in the <code>Resources</code> directory as platform folders if that platform exists in the current SDK. Instead, we should just create a list of all known platform names that have ever existing and combine it with the known platforms in an SDK (which will be mostly duplicates). We'll get this fixed in the next rev of the tooling.</li>
