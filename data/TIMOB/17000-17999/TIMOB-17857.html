<h3>Description</h3>

On Android (tested multiple versions, currently on 4.4.2) using maps module v2 the getRegion() method does not exist and pulling the region variable returns undefined.

This works as expected on iOS.

   Hi all, i needed this feature, so i fixed it.
   
   Tomorrow i'll post my github link with the working version of this module.
   
   I have also restructured the module for easy handling it with the current titanium studio version.

   Man, thanks! I think there was some work on the Maps module because it is broken on Android 5.0. 
   
   But again, thanks for looking into this. I hope the guys over at Appcelerator roll this into their next release along with the 5.0 support. The workarounds are ok, but getRegion should just work.</li>

   Oh, but mine is not a workaround.
   
   Simply the getter was missing, so i forked the original module, corrected it and repacked! 
   
   :) I'll send a pull request to the guys at appcelerator asap!</li>

   Appcelerator folks... any chance on pulling Madweb's fix and getting out in the general release?</li>

   I'm not 100% convinced that the getter was missing. For us, the .getRegion() was always present, but what failed to happen was an update after a map pan or change event. We've fixed this on our pull request to add drawing features:

   Our fork/branch works well on Android 5.1.</li>
