   I see this problem too, on SDK 3.4.0.GA
   
   <code><pre>
        &lt;Alloy&gt;
   	&lt;Window id="Win" onSwipe="onSwipe" onOpen="openWin"&gt;
   		&lt;Require id ="navBar" src="customViews/appNavBar"/&gt;
   </pre></code>
   
   this causes the scroll to move but not accelerate on Android KitKat (SGS5)
   
   when the onSwipe attribute is removed everything is back to normal
   
   can we accelerate and escalate this?

   Are there any plans to fix this? I am facing this issue even on SDK 5.4.0.GA on Webviews.</li>

   I just reproduced this issue using 8.0.1.GA with Android emulator. </li>

   Thanks for this bug report, even though it hasn't been fixed it has helped me find my problem!
   This also occurs on ScrollView, there is no inertia on the scroll when onSwipe() is present on Android (all SDKs up to 10.2).
   This bug report at least helped me find the issue, as i was stumped!</li>
