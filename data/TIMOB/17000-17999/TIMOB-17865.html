<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Issue description</h4>
I have been getting a Timeout Error for the get xhr httpclient request after upgrading to the latest 3.4 SDK. 

We upgrade from 3.2.3.GA, and everything was working fine till I have updated to latest SDK but after the update i cannot proceed ahead as i am always getting a timeout error on the get request. 

<h4>Steps to reproduce</h4>
<h4>Grab app.js and launch iOS simulator</h4>
<h4>Click XHR to request server response</h4>
<h4>Monitor Logs</h4>

   We have also been experiencing a similar issue. The application is working fine in Android, but we are getting an issue in iOS. We are testing it in iPhone 6 Plus and also on iPhone 5S. Both the devices are running on iOS 8.
   
   Update:
   Another point to note is that the issue is not happening on iOS 7, it is occurring only in iOS 8.</li>

   The documentation clearly states that the optional parameters for the "send" method on the HTTPClient are for a POST request.
   
   On older versions of the titanium SDK we were using a third party library (ASI) that automatically converted GET and HEAD requests to POST requests if there was a HTTPBody. Essentially covering up a developer mistake. 
   The new networking library no longer does this.
   
   On Android the situation is a little different. If send is called with a HTTPBody and the request is GET we modify the original url to include the HTTP parameters as the query in the request. iOS does not do this. That is why the sample works on Android.
   
   Either ways this is a developer mistake and we will not be fixing this issue.</li>
