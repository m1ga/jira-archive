					"body": "Hi Shou Liang.  Thank you for your reply.  Several quick points.\r\n\r\n1.  To maintain aspect ratio of an image, as you describe, is not how ImageView is supposed to work.  If you set BOTH the height & width, ImageView does not maintain aspect ratio.  If you fix the height or the width (but no both), aspect ratio is supposed to be maintained.  This behavior is documented.\r\n\r\nhttp://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/3.0/#!/guide/Images_and_ImageView_APIs-section-29004912_ImagesandImageViewAPIs-TheImageView\r\n\r\n=====\r\n\r\nIf you specify a width and/or height property on the image, the image will be scaled to fit according to these considerations:\r\n\r\nIf the ImageView's height and width are specified, the images will be scaled unproportionally to fit the dimensions. The graphic's aspect ratio will NOT be maintained.\r\nIf either the ImageView's height or width are specified (not both), the image will be scaled to fit the specified dimension. The graphic's aspect ratio will be maintained.\r\n=====\r\n\r\n2. If you set both the width & height to FILL, ImageView acts somewhat oddly.  Aspect ratio is maintained, but the ImageView (but not the image itself) appears to become very tall.   You can see this if you set top=\"0dp\".  The image will not be at the top.  In addition, this is not how ImageView is documented to work.  The image should actually be stretched to fill the entire screen - losing aspect ratio.\r\n\r\n3. The above is for images the need to be STRETCHED.  There seems no problem if images are SHRUNK.\r\n\r\n4.  I have not tested for various aspect ratios - w>h, w=h, w<h.  \r\n\r\n5. This issue was less apparent on lower density screens.  On the ultra higher density screens of most newer phones, the pixel width of images is often less than the screen width.  Hence, image stretching rather than shrinking is now much more common.\r\n\r\n6. Using ImageView in a ListView template is also problematic when STRETCHING images, and does not work as documented.  \r\n\r\n7. If you google \"Appcelerator Android ImageView stretch\" or similar, you will find numerous posts on the issue.  It appears to be a long-standing issue.  Some work-arounds suggested using a plain View instead of using ImageView, and to set the image as a backgroundImage for the View.  But this is silly, right?  ImageView should be more robust than a plain View for handling images.\r\n\r\n8. I don't know if this is an issue in iOS too.  I suspect it is not.  In NATIVE Android, ImageView is rather finicky when stretching images - requiring to select the correct ScaleType, etc.  Perhaps something is not translated correctly between Titanium and native Android?\r\n\r\n9. If you would like more code cases, please let me know.  I am happy to provide.\r\n\r\nMatt",
