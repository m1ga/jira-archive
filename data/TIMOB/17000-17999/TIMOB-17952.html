<h3>Description</h3>

When trying to play a sound on simulator, no audio is played and performance is very poor (unable to click buttons until the timeout for the sound playing is finished)
*This is not a regression*.

*Steps to reproduce*:
1. Build a project with the attached files, for simulator
2. Click the 'Hello, World' button
3. Notice that no sound is played and performance is very poor until the playback times out

*Expected Result*:
The sound is able to be played and does not time out *OR* the sound is not played with no performance hit (assuming that sounds are not playable on simulator)
