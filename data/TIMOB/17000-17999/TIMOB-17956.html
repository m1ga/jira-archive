<h3>Description</h3>

Hello friends,

I've been working with SDK 3.2.3 and a Module(for iOS and Android) that adds a self signed certificate with password to validate a https connection to a web service, and It's been working fine.

Now I need to implement the SDK 3.3.0 to use some of It's features and benefit from Its bug fixes, but the https connection cant be made anymore with my https module due to the new securityManagerProtocol implementation.

I've been searching all over the internet for an example of the implementation of this protocol so I can create a new Titanium Module that sends my client certificate with It's password to authenticate the https connection, but all I could find was a reference to a Modules.https that is is not available for study anywhere.

   According to <a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/3.0/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/3.0/#</a>!/guide/SSL_Certificate_Store_Support_for_HTTP_Clients I must use the new Protocol to implement a Certificate Store to my App. 
   
   The problem is that reading the documentation for the new implementation, It says nothing about adding the certificate to the Connection and passing the Key's Password to authenticate It, like I used to do with the 3.2.3 SDK version.</li>

   I agree with you, the documentation is still poor and you don't really know how to pass the certificate to the http call</li>
