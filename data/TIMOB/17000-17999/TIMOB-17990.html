<h3>Description</h3>

After an app is build onto simulator/device or even packaged, then in order to get the CLI command, we need to enable the troubleshooting preferences and then, have to re-run the command and then, find out the command from the inundated flow of logs.

Studio has to print the CLI build command (ideally before the process output) in the console view. It will make it easier to grab the command from console view.

   There is an alternate suggestion (which may be easier/more useful);
   
   Add a 'ti history' command that shows the last X commands executed by the CLI. This would take interactively prompted commands (what do you want to build: app or module?) and turn that into a complete command using appropriate switches.
   
   We would need to add a flag to allow the CLI NOT to save a history item for things like studio calling 'ti info'
   
   Finally, we would need to strip passwords from the output.</li>

   [~skypanther] The PR is merged against the master. Would you like to port it back to 3_5_X branch ?</li>

   The CLI build command is shown in the studio console view for Publish, Profile As, Debug As, Run As and Test As actions in Studio.
   However, following are few issues noticed in the command shown in the studio console logs:
   1. There is a invalid flag "--no-color" in the end for each command. The correct "--no-colors" flag is already present near the start of the command
   2. The "--sdk" flag is shown twice
   3. In all of the possible build actions other than Publish, the flag "--skip-js-minify" flag is twice
   Refer to the below example output from running a project on android device
   <code><pre>
   titanium --sdk 3.5.0.v20141203160911 --no-colors --no-progress-bars --no-prompt build --platform android --log-level trace --sdk 3.5.0.v20141203160911 --project-dir /Users/Tester/Documents/Appcelerator_Studio_Workspace/testProject --target device --android-sdk /Users/Tester/Library/android-sdk-macosx --device-id ZX1G2233HP --skip-js-minify --skip-js-minify --no-color
   </pre></code>
   
   Tested on:
   SDK: 3.5.0.v20141203160911
   Studio: 3.4.1.201410281743
   CLI: 3.4.1

   PRs contain the changes to write the build log file (includes the changes for TIMOB-12169). However, due to a few reported issues (TISTUD-7089 and TISTUD-7088), the changes for TIMOB-12169 are backed out from 3_5_X branch.</li>
<li>Satyam Sekhri 2015-01-07

   Following issues are seen with build commands in Console:
   1. While publishing (i.e. package) a project in Studio for MobileWeb, the flag "--deploy-type" is repeated.
   2. While building a project for Debug, Run, Test or Profile action, the "--skip-js-minify" is repeated
   
   Tested on:
   SDK: 3.5.0.v20150106150919
   Studio: 3.4.1.201410281743
   CLI: 3.4.1
   Alloy: 1.5.1</li>

    [~ssekhri] Can you create a separate ticket for handling the duplicate flags ? The expected functionality is already achievable with the current changes and those minor issues can be handled through a different ticket.</li>
<li>Eric Merriman  2015-01-13

    Feature implemented and validated. Closing.</li>
<li>Ewan Harris 2015-02-21

    Reopening ticket as when building with the below the build command and system info is not printed in the console. However when building with a 3.5.1 SDK the build command and system info are printed.
    
    Mac OSX 10.10.2, Windows 8.1
    Appcelerator Studio, build: 3.4.2.201502181619
    Titanium SDK build: 4.0.0.v20150220105635
    Titanium CLI, build: 3.6.0-dev
    Alloy: 1.5.1
