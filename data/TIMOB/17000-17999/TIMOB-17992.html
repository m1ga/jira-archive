<h3>Description</h3>

When breakpoints for an app is set in a manner that the app will only load on device once the break point is resumed, stepping over on the last line of the code will not allow the app to load on device/emulator. For eg. when breakpoint is inserted in a sample classic project, clicking on the resume option allows the app to load on device however clicking on step over option till the end of the file does not load the app on to device/emulator.

This is not a regression as it is reproducible with Appcelerator studio 3.3.0

Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a sample classic app
2. Insert break points on 'win1.add(label1);' on app.js file
3. Debug on an android device/emulator
4. Click on resume
5. Debug again on device/emulator
6. Step over till the end of the file.

Actual Result:
3. Break point is hit and a black screen is shown on device/emulator
4. The app loads on device/emulator and works as expected
5. Break point is hit and a black screen is shown
6. App does not load and continues showing black screen

Expected Result:
6. App should load and should work as expected.

When this is tested with iOS device and emulator, there is no issue and works as expected.

   I was able to reproduce the issue with the 3.4.0 GA studio.
   
   Environment:
   Appc Studio : 3.4.0.201409261245
   Ti SDK :  3.4.0.GA
   Mac OSX : 10.9.4
   Alloy : 1.5.0
   CLI - 3.4.0
   Code Processor: 1.1.1
   Nexus 5 - android 4.4.4</li>

   When the user steps over the last line in the app.js file, then Studio is sending the STEP_OVER debug command and is further waiting for the next command from SDK (in order to get the thread into running state). However, it didn't receive any message from the debug connection and that's why the thread remains in Stepping state and I'm not sure why SDK didn't continue to run the app.
   
   [~cwilliams] I assume this is a SDK issue, as it didn't continue to run the app even though the last line is stepped over ?</li>

   [~hpham] Can you throw in more light to understand why did the ti debugger does not respond to the step over event of the last line.</li>
