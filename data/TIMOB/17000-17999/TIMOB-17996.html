<h3>Description</h3>

Ti.Media.AudioPlayer.setTime() is an Android only method. However, when it is used on iOS, it will force the AudioPlayer to stop playing at the time passed in.

*Steps to reproduce issue*:
1. Create a new project involving the below code:
<code><pre>
var audioPlayer = Ti.Media.createAudioPlayer({
	url: '<a href="http://www.tonycuffe.com/mp3/tail%20toddle.mp3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.tonycuffe.com/mp3/tail%20toddle.mp3</a>',
});   
audioPlayer.setTime(25500);
audioPlayer.start();
</pre></code>
2. Run the app on an Android device and notice that the playback begins from the specified time location.
3. Run the app on an iOS device and notice that the playback begins from 0:00 and plays until the specified time location.

*Expected Results*:
Either setTime() should work on iOS the same way that it is described in the docs for Android (doesn't seem possible due to TIMOB-14552), the setTime() on iOS should be a different method to indicate its current behavior (endTime()?), or calling setTime() on iOS should have no effect.

   HI, does somebody has a workaround for this issue? I need to set the Time on IOS. The audio is 45 minutes long and i need to set a method to make the audioplayer start from minute 23 to 45.</li>
