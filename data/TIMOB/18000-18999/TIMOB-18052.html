<h3>Description</h3>

The iOS 8.2 beta includes support for WatchKit, implemented in a similar fashion to Share Extensions (TIMOB-17335)

<a href="https://developer.apple.com/watchkit/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://developer.apple.com/watchkit/</a>

We should provide support in the Titanium SDK for developing WatchKit-enabled applications.

   Like iOS 8 extensions - if we can't provide the Ti runtime in the extension, we could at least allow for the target to be created in the Ti app, so the watch extension can be attached to it (<a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/General/Conceptual/WatchKitProgrammingGuide/ConfiguringYourXcodeProject.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014969-CH2-SW1)." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/General/Conceptual/WatchKitProgrammingGuide/ConfiguringYourXcodeProject.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014969-CH2-SW1).</a>
   
   We'll need the WatchKit API's that the phone uses exposed as a module I imagine.</li>

   Since this came out today: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/watchkit/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://developer.apple.com/watchkit/</a> I wonder if its possible to use Ti.UI namespace for this. It seems that all UI elements possible to use are bundled in the watchkit (WKInterface). Secondly, in the begining of the video, Apple stats that we cannot create runtime UI, so all UI most be prebaked into Storyboards.
   
   Is this something Titanium can adapt to (within 3.x ) ? </li>

   Can you guys also test the WatchKit portion being written with Swift? One of two things need to happen:
   
   1. The documentation needs to cover how to do it with Swift
   2. The documentation needs to specifically state if it's not supported.
   
   We don't need people writing stuff in Swift if it won't work.</li>

   I was able to get a swift extension to compile in Ti...so I assume it will work...</li>

   Hey Rick, did you manage to get the Swift extension running in the sim? I managed to build my swift extension, it all compiled fine, but have yet to get it running in the simulator. After days and days of digging around, i found an crash log for my extension saying "Library not loaded: @rpath/libswiftCore.dylib". When looking into the project generated by Titanium, there is a flag called "Embedded Content Contains Swift Code", this is set to No, which i assume is my problem.
   
   It seems that we need a way to set this flag, otherwise swift is not supported.</li>

   [~jdrucey] Did you file a ticket about the Swift flag?</li>

   Hi Jamie, isn't this really at the extension level?  I ran into this with just a native Obj-C project.

   @Ben, Certainly I loved you notes on ibswiftCore.dylib error which I performed few tests in swift but that was full of glitches and I think this is the best way to embed swift to objective-c for other client projects we had few things which were not been the best in form what should be done but now its clear by doing that provided stuff.. cheers. thanks!

    As of right now, all known WatchKit related issues have been resolved. There may be bugs, but we'll fix those as we find them. :)</li>
