<h3>Description</h3>

In the Kitchen Sink test: Phone > Sound > Local with File URL, there is a button to "Change file". It is intended to change the file that the sound is playing by changing the URL of that sound. This does not work and the sound is not changed.

Please see TIMOB-3348 and TIMOB-1488 where this issue was flagged and marked as 'won't fix'. Requesting that the "Change file" button be removed from the test.

*Steps to reproduce issue:*
1. Launch Kitchen Sink
2. Go to the Phone > Sound > Local with File URL test
3. Click Play. Notice that the crickets noise plays
4. Click Change file. Notice that the crickets noise continues to play

*Expected Result:*
Either the noise will change or the button should not be present if the functionality doesn't exist (looks like the case)

*Actual Result:*
The sound doesn't change

The "Change file" button should be removed.
