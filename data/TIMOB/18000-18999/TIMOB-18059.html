<h3>Description</h3>

Between Google and Apple alone, there have been 30+ releases this year of various pieces of our software stack.

While we blog when something is truly broken (i.e. <a href="http://www.appcelerator.com/blog/2014/10/updating-to-android-platform-tools-version-21/)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.appcelerator.com/blog/2014/10/updating-to-android-platform-tools-version-21/)</a>, and we link people to tickets to track status, it's not feasible to let everyone know in this way if Android SDK 23.0.2 is safe to use (though we may have tested it internally to confirm)

A easy proposal would be to create a status page, similar to <a href="http://status.appcelerator.com." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://status.appcelerator.com.</a> I have investigated reusing an existing status page sites, but they are not quite right for the purpose, so I believe we may need to create our own.

Requirements:
* Groups for each of the main families (Apple, Google, BlackBerry, Microsoft, etc)
* Sub-sections for each of the individual areas (iOS, OS X). Debatable if we should instead just have them in a date-ordered cross-product list.
* Columns for name, version, test environment, related JIRA tickets
** green = tested
** yellow = test in progress
** red = test failed
** grey = untested

My expectation this would be a Node.ACS application with some way of adding items to the matrix, and another item for updating status. Perhaps we can query status based on JIRA tickets...even if QE has an internal ticket to verify it working, the status page changes color based on that.

See attached page for a sample (though could be made prettier)

   I like this a lot and would love to have this as a reference with customers.  Would this be automated on CI builds?  Would we have a separate page for GA builds?  The prototype seems to have Studio and SDK separate, but what about CLI or Alloy (others?).</li>
<li>Ingo Muschenetz 2014-11-19

   Please note that this is not related to SDK builds. This is only for the releases of our dependencies that we want to let people know have been confirmed as working. see may have a separate page for SDK. It really should say "Google" vs. "Android"</li>
<li>Ingo Muschenetz 2014-11-19

   If we wanted, we could have column(s) for various SDK/Studio versions so it was more matrix-like, but that could be confusing.</li>
<li>Rick Blalock 2014-11-20

   I love this idea.  
   
   Columns doesn't seem that confusing to me.  Example:  <a href="http://status.twilio.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://status.twilio.com</a>
   
   Or maybe something like this:  <a href="https://status.basecamp.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://status.basecamp.com</a>
   
   Where a column could represent a platform and the items under it would represent the different version #'s, etc.</li>
<li>Bert Grantges 2014-11-20

   Yep - i'm on board, i'd like to see also see us add tested Ti SDKs to this as well</li>
<li>Ingo Muschenetz 2014-11-20

   [~rblalock] [~bgrantges] Would one of you like to mock up what/how you see that information being presented?</li>
