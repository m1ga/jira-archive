<h3>Description</h3>

After the update of TiJSCore(TIMOB-11093) and titanium_profiler(TIMOB-17925) for 64 bit support the profiler is no longer emitting explicit function names. Most function calls show up as either (anonymous functions) or (program). This is a change in behavior from the old profiler behavior where the function names would show up.

   I'll need you to take a look at this.</li>

   Output from buildTiCore.sh</li>

   [~vduggal], [~ingo], here is my take on the profiler issue so far. I don’t know of a simple fix becuase I don’t yet know the root cause of the problem. I am not convinved that the problem is not with our changes to titanium_profiler. The new v20 tijscore fails to build for me, which I need to debug JavaScriptCore to see if the problem is there. The next steps are to understand why buildTiCore.sh fails on my MBP. There are 82 compiler errors before clang gives up, and the errrors don’t look simple.
   
   [~vduggal], please look at the output from <code>buildTiCore.sh</code> that I have attached to this issue as [^buildTiCore_output.txt]. For example:
   
   <code><pre>
   In file included from /Users/matt/Documents/Appcelerator/src/Appcelerator/tijscore/JavaScriptCore/heap/BlockAllocator.h:37:
   /Users/matt/Documents/Appcelerator/src/Appcelerator/tijscore/JavaScriptCore/heap/HeapBlock.h:52:26: error: no template named 'DoublyLinkedListNode'; did you mean 'DoublyLinkedList'?
   class HeapBlock : public DoublyLinkedListNode&lt;T&gt; {
                            ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                            DoublyLinkedList
   </pre></code>
   
   [~vduggal], I will need to work with you in the morning to understand your build system. It is foreign to me and different from how Apple builds their JavaScriptCore. I need a JavaScriptCore Xcode project to perform further debugging, so you will have to help me integrate your build system into Apple's JavaScriptCore Xcode project.</li>

   [~vduggal] can you please add a test case that reproduces the problem?</li>
<li>Ingo Muschenetz 2014-12-11

   Deferring this out of 3.5.0, as clicking on the function names still takes you to the correct line.</li>
