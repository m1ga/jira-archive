<h3>Description</h3>

For now it is not possible to get count if items inside list (or section) filtered by search view on android. ListSection.itemCount is avaliable for iOS (however not documented) but not for android.

   It will be nice to get filtered items also.</li>

   I wrote small plugin to access search item count <a href="https://github.com/farwayer/TiListSearchItems" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/farwayer/TiListSearchItems</a> Maybe it will be useful to somebody.</li>

   It will add itemCount/getItemCount to ListSection for Android</li>

   I've rebased the PR, added unit tests, cleaned up commit messages and altered to expose as <code>Ti.UI.ListSection.filteredItemCount</code> on Android. I *did not* implement a <code>Ti.UI.ListSection.filteredItemCount</code> on iOS, nor did I expose an <code>Ti.UI.ListSection.itemCount</code> on Android.
   I suspect for parity we'd want both to be done. The latter is likely pretty easy, but the iOS filtered item count may be more involved as the filter results are calculated on the <code>ListView</code> and aren't really "shared" down to the <code>ListSection</code> cc [~vijaysingh]</li>

   As a heads up, the Android ListView is going to be 100% rewritten to use RecyclerView in the near future, making this PR irrelevant. We can keep the feature request ticket, but it will have to be re-implemented.</li>
