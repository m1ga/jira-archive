<h3>Description</h3>

Hi when I install any app in android emulator it takes more times approximately 2 minutes + for every built in windows 7 Ti Studio 3.2.1. First time it takes time it's no matter but second, third time why? Titanium SDK 3.1.3 it worked well but the affected version is Ti SDK 3.2.0,3.2.1. Another issue sometimes open more than one emulator when we run but already one emulator is exist.

   Does a new Android emulator instance is opened every time you launch the app on emulator, even though the same emulator instance is already opened ?
   Do you see the same issue if you create a new emulator instance using the option 'Manage AVDs' in Preferences > Android, and then run the app on the new emulator ?
   
   Also, would it be possible for you to enable the Log Level to All in Preferences > Troubleshooting, and then run the app on emulator couple of times to recreate the problem - and then send us the Studio log file (Help > Studio > View log file).</li>

   [~morahman] Please provide your inputs in order to investigate this further. I'm curious to figure out whether the emulators are created with previous versions of Titanium 3.1.X are causing this behavior to re-launch new emulator instance every time. If you have created a new emulator instance using Android AVD manager, would you be able to re-launch the app in the same existing emulator instance ?</li>

   Hi [~pinnamuri],
   
   New Emulator is opening where already exist. It doesn't my main problem. My main problem is App takes so much time to run for every time built although it runs existing emulator, not new creation emulator. And I attached update appLog and studioLog where you can see that how much time it takes. And I said that at 3.1.3 studio and emulator it took less time to build. And the problem studio-3.2.1 and SDK is 3.2.1, 3.2.2.
   
   Thanks.</li>
