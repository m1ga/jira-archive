<h3>Description</h3>

Having a built-in feature to clear a WebView's cache just seems right. If modern web browsers give users the ability to clear the cache or cookies or sessions, a cross-platform like Titanium's WebView should give that feature as well.

   Hi,
   Any updates on this issue.
   
   We are having some problem with the webview and it is directly navigating to dashboard without asking the user credentials.</li>

   Hello team,
   
   Do we've an update on this?
   
   I'm surprised to see that this ticket was created in late 2014 and there is not comment on this. This is a very serious issue and a security breach, please provide an update.
   
   Thank you.</li>
