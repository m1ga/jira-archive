<h3>Description</h3>

This hook is in the <code>cli/hooks/ws-package.js</code> file. This hook should copy the wp-package.js hook. It simply needs to sign the app and copy it to the output directory.

   Do we need to create a signing certificate for them, as well?</li>
<li>Dawson Toth 2015-05-27

   Let me be a little more precise -- we talked about creating some tooling that will guide the user through creating a signing certificate, rather than just using a hard coded cert that might use our name, etc. Is this ticket for creating that tooling, too, or is that something else?</li>

   [~dtoth] This ticket should be about whatever we need to help guide the user in building a Windows Store app beyond what we do currently.
   
   From my memory the issues here are:
   - We need the user to create and install a certificate they will use to sign their app using a private key generated from that cert. Right now just pointing them at the Windows docs on doing that would be better than nothing, though obviously in an ideal world we'd step them through that somehow if we knew they had no cert.
   - We need to generate the private key from that cert and embed it in the app. It may simply be that we again point them at the docs for generating the key from the cert and then tell them to place it in their Resources directory. If we see no pfx file, that may be the trigger to point them at the docs for the cert/key generation.
   - We need some way for the user to specify the publisherName they used for the cert, so that we place that in the appxmanifest we generate during the build. I'm assuming a tiapp.xml property would be the right place for this? It'd be a string like "CN=Contoso Software, O=Contoso Corporation, C=US". Ideally the CLI would again help in verifying that a value exists for store builds, and possibly prompting and setting it for them if not?
