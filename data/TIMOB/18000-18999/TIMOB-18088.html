<h3>Description</h3>

My developer certifications are not being recognized by Studio, nor is the WWDR certificate. All certs are verified and present in my keychains, but whether the default, System, or login keychains are selected, the refresh button only loads my Distribution certs. Attempting to obtain new copies through Studio's 'Get New' button errors out on the daw.apple.com side as can be seen in the following screen-cap: <a href="http://cl.ly/image/0F2c3a1Q0c1y" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://cl.ly/image/0F2c3a1Q0c1y</a> 
Here is another screen cap of an attempted deployment to device: <a href="http://cl.ly/image/2f2s263m471p" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://cl.ly/image/2f2s263m471p</a> (at the end, it goes to the same "Oops!" page as the other).
I have already attempted to uninstall and re-install Appcelerator Studio to no avail.

   Having the same issue (and I guess TC-5049 is the same as well). According to Fokke (and I can confirm) Apple changed the certificate names from 'iPhone Developer' to 'iOS Development". <code>node-appc/lib/ios.js</code> parses <code>security dump-keychain</code> to find the correct Certificates and now fails.
   
   I will try to fix this myself and if I succeed will do a PR</li>

   Please note the merge-3.5.0 label, which is the next available version. We may consider doing a 3.4.2 CI build as well.</li>

   Old Studio URL was "<a href="https://daw.apple.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/DSAuthWeb.woa/830/wo/6EPTsc2dTuMWsct3zhfrOg/0.1.3.1.1.2.1.1.3.1.1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://daw.apple.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/DSAuthWeb.woa/830/wo/6EPTsc2dTuMWsct3zhfrOg/0.1.3.1.1.2.1.1.3.1.1</a>". Updated URL appears to be <a href="https://developer.apple.com/account/ios/certificate/certificateList.action." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://developer.apple.com/account/ios/certificate/certificateList.action.</a> Can fix this at go.appcelerator.com.</li>

   It looks like the issue is in <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/node-appc/blob/master/lib/ios.js#L151" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/node-appc/blob/master/lib/ios.js#L151</a></li>

   We are splitting this issue into two. The Studio link issue will be TISTUD-7068  and this issue will be repurposed to focus on the developer cert rename.
   
   Our account certificates are still "iPhone Developer" and "iPhone Distribution". We tired to revoke and regenerate on both our account and on Chris' account but each attempt resulted in the same legacy names. Chris is looking at where the changes are needed and we will test this when he is done, but without getting a cert with the new name we will be unable to validate the fix.
   
   For those this is affecting do you have individual or enterprise accounts? I'm trying to understand when and where this occurs. I will try on my personal account to regenerate all provisions that are tied to the cert. 
   
   Just tried my personal account:
   1) Removed all my provisions
   2) Downloaded my personal developer cert - This showed as "iOS Development" which was good
   3) Happy that I got the new name, I regenerated everything since I would need to in order to do production tests. Now the certs are coming in as "iPhone Developer". 
   
   Could this be related to the CSR generation?

   It happened to me after a fresh install of Yosemite. Have an iCloud keychain, but that does not include certificates and private keys</li>
<li>Eric Merriman  2014-11-25

   [~timanrebel] Thanks, we will try on a fresh install.</li>

   Update:
   I was able to generate a new development certificate with the more recent name using Xcode (preferences>accounts - refresh, then plus to generate new cert) but was unable to use the same technique for generating a distribution certificate. So I can test this from a development standpoint and will continue to try for generating the distribution with the name "iOS Distribution"
   
   Since I was forced to generate the distribution certificate through the standard CSR process, that one has the older named "iPhone Distribution" See the attached screen "halfway.png". Note the differences in the two.</li>
