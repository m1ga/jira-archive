<h3>Description</h3>

When LiveView disconnects from the server it starts throwing exception after exception.  We are currently capturing all of these exceptions which pollutes the Performance Management results for that application.  We either need to recognize that it is a LiveView error and not capture it OR we need LiveView to not fire off a bunch of errors when it gets disconnected.

Not to mention this is increasing API usage and server load.  For one sample app (single user), these errors account for over 1000 handled exceptions in a 24 hour period.

<code><pre>
[LiveView] The operation couldn’t be completed. Operation timed out
</pre></code>

AND 

<code><pre>
[LiveView] The operation couldn’t be completed. Network is unreachable
</pre></code>

AND 

<code><pre>
[LiveView] Event Server unavailable. Connection Refused @ 192.168.1.6:8324 [LiveView] Please ensure your device and computer are on the same network and the port is not blocked.
</pre></code>

   [~ngupta] / [~ingo] Which project should I move this live view bug to?</li>
<li>Ingo Muschenetz 2014-12-05

   [~nle] TIMOB, LiveView component</li>

   However, I do think the server should handle it too, as we can only fix new versions of LiveView, not older ones.</li>

   APM is no more, but this was actually handled by providing a no-op shim</li>
