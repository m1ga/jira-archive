<h3>Description</h3>

Add the cURL-based network connectivity tests from the <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium-connection-test" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium-connection-test</a> project to the <code>ti setup check</code> functions. Connections should be made via the proxy (if any) as configured with the existing CLI network configuration functionality. 

The solution must account for Windows or other systems on which cURL is not installed. The curl executable must be override-able.

If all sites are reachable, output a simple message, like:

✓ cURL connection test

If sites are unreachable, output a message for each site that cannot be access, like:

✕ api.appcelerator.net is unreachable via cURL

   The cURL commands fail on all platforms now because of invalid usernames/passwords. (The same is true of the titanium-connection-test utility, though it's checks mistakenly show the tests as successful because they don't check results sufficiently.) Regardless, if we supply working user credentials for the tests, those usernames and passwords will be in the public titanium repo , instead of being in the private titanium-connection-test repo.</li>

   This functionality will be implemented in the Appc CLI instead.</li>
