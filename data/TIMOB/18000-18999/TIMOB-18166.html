<h3>Description</h3>

*Details:* If you package your Titanium app to the AppStore and export it as an ad hoc package from the Xcode Archiver, then you will not be able to launch the packaged app on device.

*Note:* 
* This is *not a regression* as this does not occur with 3.4.1.GA
* If you open the Xcode project for the Titanium app built for the AppStore and archive from Xcode, then you will be able to install and launch the ad hoc packaged app
* If you package the Titanium app for the AppStore using an ad hoc provisioning profile from CLI, then you will be able to install and launch the packaged app fine: <code>ti build -p ios -T dist-appstore -R "Michael Asher (WY35J6ST95)" -P &lt;ad hoc provisioning&gt;</code>
* If you follow the below reproducible steps, notice the beta-reports-active entitlement (see ad_hoc.png). beta-reports-active entitlement should *only* appear if you validate your app for the AppStore (see app_store.png).

*Steps to reproduce:*
1. Create a Titanium app with the correct splash screens and icon images
2. Package the app for iOS iTunes Store; make sure to select the App Store provisioning profile
3. Wait for the Xcode Archiver to open
4. Select the archived app and go to: Export > Save for Ad Hoc Deployment
5. Install the packaged app to device from either Xcode or iTunes

*Actual:* If you install the packaged app from Xcode, you will get an alert dialog (see alert.png). If you install from iTunes, you will see errors in the Xcode console related to beta-reports-active (see xcode_console.txt) and the app will be greyed.

*Expected:* You should be able to install and launch a packaged app from Xcode Archiver.

   I struggled with the problem described when trying with Ti Studio. Thanks for the notes in your description because when using CLI and building the archive for distribution and specifying the ad hoc profile instead of the store profile, it finally worked. Its not clear to me what Titanium Studio is doing that prevents the archive file from being resigned in Xcode for ad-hoc. Obviously it has to do with the beta-reports-active attribute in the entitlements list, but why is this not a problem when building the archive from Xcode originally then re-signing it? Strange.</li>

   [~patakijv] It is for sure because of the beta-reports-active. The reason why Xcode doesn't have this problem is that from what we can tell, Xcode is automatically handling this situation. We continue to investigate to see if there is a way to improve this.</li>

   In case it is not clear to someone why it is important that the scenario work as "expected", we have a situation right now were our Titanium apps are getting stuck at launch time for the Apple App Store reviewers (after 3 consecutive attempts with 2 apps that both are already in the app store as previous versions). When we build the same code for ourselves and test using developer or adhoc profiles at build time we cannot reproduce this problem, everything launches as expected (and the reviewers don't provide logs). The Apple recommended way to troubleshoot a problem like this that the reviewer sees is to take the exact archive (binary?) that was originally created for the app store and resign and save it as adhoc and install (not to rebuild using adhoc or development profiles) so we can test the very same build that the reviewer is testing. As long as this is broken from the Titanium workflow (CLI or GUI), we cannot troubleshoot and test the same build the reviewer is testing. Any suggestions?</li>
<li>Eric Merriman  2015-01-26

   Let me see if we can bring this up for discussion. You can do the same from studio (signing as adhoc during an "App store" archive build). This will prevent the entitlement from being included, but based on your previous comment, also won't reproduce the problem you are seeing. </li>

   still happening with 5.0.2 .

   all of my apps are broken because of this. What's going on? the beta-reports-active is always present and prevents the deploy on the device.</li>
<li>Alberto Marcone 2015-10-30

   the suggested workaround (recompile the app from xcode) doesn't work. If I recompile the app with xcode the generated IPA is missing all of the assets from the app (images, json files, etc).</li>
