<h3>Description</h3>

On a new Windows 7 machine, though Android SDK is installed and available, the titanium info command does not return any platform targets for Android SDK. No errors are displayed with the titanium info command.

However, only when I ran android list command, the output contains "xcopy not recognized as a valid command". After updating the env variable PATH with the location of xcopy, only then titanium info command is able to resolve the Android platform targets on the machine.

So, CLI is not able to parse the "android list" output if there are any warnings/errors, though they shouldn't impact the list of platforms/emulators.

   This problem also happens on Windows 8.1 systems with existing Titanium installations.
   
   The xcopy.exe command is located in %SystemRoot%\system32 (typically C:\Windows\System32, though could be elsewhere). This folder reference would typically be added to the <code>Path</code> variable in the System Variables section of the Environment Variables dialog rather than the <code>PATH</code> variable in the User Variables section. Those are concatenated to create the actual environment for cmd/PowerShell.
   
   Remove %SystemRoot%\system32; from the path and the error will occur with <code>ti info</code>. The error appears to happen when exec'ing the <code>wmic</code> command in node-app/lib/environ, here: <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/node-appc/blob/master/lib/environ.js#L243" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/node-appc/blob/master/lib/environ.js#L243</a>
   
   Running <code>wmic os get Caption,Version</code> at the prompt even with system32 missing from the path is successful.</li>
