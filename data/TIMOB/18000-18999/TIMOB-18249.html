   I am going to reformat the text of this ticket to reflect the crashing behavior. Things are getting a little confused by the data I provided in the original report conflicting with the comments and edits. For example, the logging behavior is not a regression, but it seems the crash is. I will create a new ticket for the logging issue as I have no iron-clad indication the two are related (log output and crash). I will try to provide the most accurate detail on the affected iOS and device information.  </li>
