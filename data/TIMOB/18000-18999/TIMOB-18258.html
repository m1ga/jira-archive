<h3>Description</h3>

This is a regression as the app can be successfully debugged using titanium sdk 3.4.1 GA.

When a file is included in app.js and breakpoints are placed in the included file, the app crashes and hence unable to debug successfully.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Close any running emulators or simulators. 
2. Import and open the attached project into studio
3. From Titanium Studio go to Debug perspective (Window > Open perspective > Debug) 
4. In the Breakpoints view, Remove All existing breakpoints 
5. Go to file -> import -> select breakpoints under Run/Debug and click next 
6. Browse to breakpoint-basic.bkpt in Test File Location 
7. Debug the test project.  

Actual Results:
App is installed on to device, and when the app is launched when the studio prompts it tries to connect to debugger however it crashes immediately when it has connected.

Expected Results:
App should be installed, and when the app connects to debugger, the app should be suspended at the breakpoint in import.js line 6.

   This was resolved as part of TIMOB-17924.</li>

   This looks fixed on devices, however I am still encountering the described behavior on simulator, using:
   
   Titanium SDK 3.5.0.v20150106102524
   Studio 3.4.1.201410281743 
   Xcode 6.1.1
   
   On: 
   iPad Air, iOS 8.1
   iPhone 6 Sim, iOS 8.1
   iPhone 4S Sim, iOS 8.1
   
   I do not see any messages on screen, but the app returns to the home screen after displaying the splash screen.
   This is in the console:
   <code><pre>

   Just a note that i'm also seeing this error, and I am not using any breakpoints, and running from CLI.
