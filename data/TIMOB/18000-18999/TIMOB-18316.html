When i launch to the emulator, using: 

ti build -p windows -T wp-emulator -C 8-1-1 --wp-publisher-guid 00000000-0000-1000-8000-000000000000

   Note that This exact error was happening for users in the Titanium Contributors flow as well. There's a related issue open for windowslib to better surface the underlying error messages here: <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/windowslib/issues/5" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/windowslib/issues/5</a>
   
   In this case, the user(s) on the Titanium Contributor flow reported that the true error message was: 
   <code><pre>
   Error: Package failed updates, dependency or conflict validation.
   </pre></code>

   Thanks Chris, is there a workaround or solution that I can try out or am i stuck?</li>
<li>Christopher Williams 2015-01-07

   I think I've found the issue. Basically this will happen if the DLLs fail to load as Gary states, and this is a direct result of some sort of build issue either on our building/packaging on Jenkins, or in the cmake setup we use for the user projects. In this case, I believe it was both, resulting from new modules being adding as separate libraries - specifically The "Ti" module. When a new module is added, or sometimes even when dependencies between modules change, it requires tweaks to our build to make sure we pick up the generated libs when we package up the SDK on Jenkins - and it requires tweaks to the cmake scripts to be able to reference and find the built library.

   So one of the reasons why we only saw this on some people's machines was when they installed the SDK. If they installed the SDK before the new "Ti" module got in, it should have worked. But anyone who tried an SDK after that would get this failure (which is why so many of the end users are seeing this).</li>

   Thanks Chris. Is there some workaround for me?
   
   I did have older SDKs and Ti installed.
   
   I can uninstall and try to resin tall again if you think that may work?</li>

   [~lbrenman] The PR just got merged and the SDK is building. Once it's done you should be able to just do a <code>ti sdk install -b master -d</code> and get the fix. You'll have to modify your existing project to use that SDK version in the tiapp.xml. Given historical build times, I'd expect the build to be done about 45 minutes from now.</li>

   FYI, I just verified using the latest master build and it worked for me, so hopefully you can try now [~lbrenman].</li>

   Hi Chris, I just tried and it worked!!! Thanks for the taking care of this so quickly.</li>
