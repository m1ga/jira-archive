<h3>Description</h3>

*Details:* On Android, if you kill and relaunch the same app *on device*, console logs will not appear again.

*Note:* 
* This is *not a regression* since this occurs with SDK 3.4.1.GA
* This *does not occur* on iOS, however, the expected behavior for iOS is debatable. After you kill and relaunch the same app on an *iOS device*, console logs will still appear, however, peculiar error logs appear first; see ios_logs.txt. 
* For Android, this "seems expected" since a new pid is generated after killing the app and the CLI does not track the new pid when the app relaunches. However, this does not achieve parity with iOS behavior; see android_logs.txt for what is printed out once the app is killed

*Steps to reproduce:*
1. Create a default Titanium app from CLI
2. To track console logs, make sure the following pieces of code are added:
<code><pre>
...
win1.addEventListener('focus', function() {
    Ti.API.info('####### focused on win1');
});
...
win2.addEventListener('focus', function() {
    Ti.API.info('####### focused on win2');
});
...
tabGroup.open();
</pre></code>
3. From CLI, install app to an Android device
4. Once the app is launched, switch between the tabs and verify logs are printed out
5. Next, kill the app either via Task Manager or holding home button and swiping
6. Relaunch app and switch between the tabs

*Actual:* Logs are not printed anymore to terminal.
*Expected:* Logs should be printed to terminal again???
