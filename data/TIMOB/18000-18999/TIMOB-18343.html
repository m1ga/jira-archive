<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Description</h4>

*This issue only happens intermittently* 

When disconnecting a device after building and then opening an app to the device, intermittently some unexpected output is shown in the console, due to having difficulty in reliably being able to reproduce the issue I have only seen it in Studio but the stack trace given leads me to believe that it is occurring in the CLI.

*Please see attached logs.txt file to see the output*

<h4>Steps To Reproduce</h4>

*I am unsure as to how to reliably reproduce this issue, but I believe that these steps can reproduce the issue*

1. Build a project to device
2. Open the app and then disconnect the device

<h4>Actual Result</h4>

The output in logs.txt in shown in the console.

<h4>Expected Result</h4>

There should be no unexpected output.

   Closing, versions have changed drastically since this was filed. Would be very surprised if this still occurs</li>
