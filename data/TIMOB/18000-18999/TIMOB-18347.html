<h3>Description</h3>

I can build and run a two-tabbed default classic project (created with <code>ti new</code>) just fine. However, I cannot run a stock default new alloy project. It builds, opens, and immediately closes. After just a brief moment, the build script ends and returns to the prompt with the following:

<code><pre>
[INFO]  Writing build manifest: C:\Users\Tim\AppData\Local\Temp\ALOY1180\build-manifest.json
[INFO]  Copying results back to project build directory
[INFO]  Finished building the application in 18s 663ms
[INFO]  Finished building the application in 19s 710ms
[INFO]  Installing and launching the application
[INFO]  Project built successfully in 19s 710ms

[ERROR] The remote procedure call failed.
</pre></code>

(With a classic app, the build command doesn't exits and I continue to get log output from the emulator.)

I can’t open the app from the emulator’s app screen either — again, it opens and immediately closes.

I have tried simplifying the app to simply one label in a window with no styling applied and get the same results.

<code><pre>
<Alloy>
   <Window class="container">
      <Label id="label">Hello, World</Label>
   </Window>
</Alloy>
</pre></code>

FYI, to install the Windows branch of Alloy, use:
<code>npm install -g git://github.com/appcelerator/alloy.git#windows</code>

   After trying to build, I see the same result as Tim. I then opened the sln file in VS 2013 U4 and tried to debug on emulator and eventually hit an uncaught exception stemming from HAL. (There are three caught exceptions stemming from the logger trying to connect to the CLI, then we see the uncaught HAL exceptions)</li>

   Non alloy projects also have the same issue.</li>

   [~pl4gu3b0rn] There's an intermittent issue where apps close immediately on simulator, but can be opened by manually launching them (clicking through the emulator). This issue is specific to our handling of the underscore.js require used by alloy and prevents alloy apps from ever launching.</li>

   Ah well my application im testing with is not alloy. And this also shows the same log output when launched from the cli. And always closes after the splash screen is displayed.
   
   Opening them again after it has closed will either do the same again, or just show a black screen.
   
   Totally new to windows phone development here, is there any useful log output I can get to to try and work out where its failing? I have tried opening up the solution file in visual studio and running it there, but I get deployment errors.</li>

   The original issue for alloy _appears_ to be fixed now. There are other bugs tangentially related to alloy that need to be fixed that I've found (TIMOB-18347).</li>
<li>Tim Poulsen 2015-01-28

   I concur. I can build and run an Alloy app on the Windows Phone emulator using the most recent SDK master and the changes in TIMOB-18457.</li>

   Closing ticket as fixed with reference to previous comments.</li>
