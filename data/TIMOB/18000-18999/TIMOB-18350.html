<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Description</h4>

*I believe that I am able to reproduce this crash, I have seen the crash 3 times while performing the steps to reproduce and all 3 times give me the same crash.*

It *is not a regression* as I have seen it occur in 3.4.1.GA.

I am experiencing a crash in KS->Base UI->Views->List View->Remote Images in ListView. While scrolling back and forth through the app quickly I regularly see crashes, I have attached the crash logs as crash2.txt.

<h4>Steps To Reproduce</h4>

1. Install KitchenSink from master branch onto an iOS device
2. Navigate to Base UI->Views->List View->Remote Images in ListView
3. Accept the message and then scroll back and forth through the app quickly. It make take a little time but the app should crash

<h4>Actual Result</h4>

The app will crash

<h4>Expected Result</h4>

The app should not crash

   Not a regression, but a crash, so moving into next sprint.</li>

   I wonder if this is related to TC-5161. Going to test out the SDK that has this fix.</li>

   Verified fixed, using:
   
   Titanium SDK 4.0.0.v20150303161012
   Studio 4.0.0.201502171827
   CLI 3.4.2-rc4
   Xcode 6.2b5
   
   I scrolled around the app for 3 minutes and did not witness a crash.</li>

   Can we make the resolution for this ticket configurable? I'd prefer to have images load even when the ListView is being scrolled, as we have feeds of images as the main use case of our app. If no images are loading, the common pattern of slowly scrolling the feed yields a feed without images now.</li>
