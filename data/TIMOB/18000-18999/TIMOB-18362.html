<h3>Description</h3>

This is not a regression as it can be reproduced with titanium sdk 3.4.1GA

With the allowEditing property of showCamera set, the app crashes when the process of capturing an image and displaying it as a view is repeated several times. The displaying of the captured image as a view is also not smooth after repeating the process for about 10 times. 

Note: Without the allowEditing property, the app seems to work fine. However, without the allowEditing property, the app seems to crash after repeating the process nearly 30-40 times and this crash type is different. [Refer to attachment: unknown for the crashlog]

Steps to reproduce:
1. Run and launch the attached app.js 
2. Click on the white window
3. Capture an image and choose "Use photo"
4. repeat step 2 and 3 several times (about 17-20 odd times)

Actual Results:
1. A white window is displayed
2. Camera opens up
3. Image is displayed on the white window
4. After repeating more than 10 times, the transition from the captured image to the window (after choosing 'Use Photo') is not smooth and after about 20 times, the app crashes.  [Refer to attachment: backboardd for the crashlog]

Expected Results:
5. Transition must be smooth and app should not crash.

   Memory issue. The way the app is setup after every photo taken an imageView is added to the window so all the images stay in memory and it runs out of memory. Modify the app to use a single ImageView and it should work fine</li>
