<h3>Description</h3>

It would be great if we could specify a custom build path, rather than ./build

Scenarios:
With iOS requiring a Mac, and WinMo requiring Windows, having two computers and one codebase is going to become common. It would be nice to have code on a network share, while building/compiling to the computer's local storage... without having to use source control as a method of data transfer.

Also, for computers that have a small, fast SSD and a big slow HD, it would allow us to build to the fast SSD while using the HD for code storage.

This could also be a possible workaround for people that run into TIMOB-18285 even after the changes.
