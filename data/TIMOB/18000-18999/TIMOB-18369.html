<h3>Description</h3>

This is a regression as the Step Over operation can be performed successfully using titanium sdk 3.4.1 GA.
Stepping over operation fails when a file is included in app.js and breakpoints are placed in the included file.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Close any running emulators or simulators. 
2. Import and open the attached project into studio
3. From Titanium Studio go to Debug perspective (Window > Open perspective > Debug) 
4. In the Breakpoints view, Remove All existing breakpoints 
5. Go to file -> import -> select breakpoints under Run/Debug and click next 
6. Browse to breakpoint-basic.bkpt in Test File Location 
7. Debug the test project.
8. Check the result (Call frames in Debug view) for the first breakpoint hit.
9. From Titanium Studio click 'Step Over' 

Actual Results:
7. Application runs in the debug mode.
8. In the debug view, there are 3 call frames. One of them is empty which is not required. Please refer to the attached screenshot.
 [Eval Script] [import.js:6] 
 [Eval Script]
 [Top-level Script] [app.js:1] 

9. Line 2 is not highlighted in app.js. 

Expected Results:
7. Application runs in the debug mode.
8. In the debug view, there should be only two call frames as mentioned below.
 [Eval Script] [import.js:6] 
 [Top-level Script] [app.js:1] 
9. Line 2 should be highlighted in app.js after Step Over operation .

   Can we please simplify this does to two short files that can be shown in the ticket themselves (as opposed to importing a project with a lot of extra items)?
   
   Did this work as of testing TIMOB-18258 and has since regressed?</li>
<li>Khushbu Agrawal 2015-01-14

   [~ingo] Yes, we can just simplify it to those two files (app.js, import.js).
   I have attached app.js and import.js files from simple classic app in which the issue is reproducible.
   Just need to place breakpoints at line 6 and line 9 in import.js file. And line 3 in app.js file.
   
   Step Over in the included file is not working in titanium SDK 3.5.0.v20150106224118 with which the bug TIMOB-18258 was verified.</li>
<li>Eric Wieber 2015-02-25

   Verified fixed using:
   
   Titanium SDK 3.5.1.v20150223154830
   Studio 3.4.2.201502181619
   CLI 3.4.2-alpha
   Xcode 6.2b5
   
   Only two call frames are shown and the 'Step Over' operation correctly highlights the next line.</li>
