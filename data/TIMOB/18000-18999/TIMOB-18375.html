<h3>Description</h3>

Right now the iOS plist values CFBundleVersion and CFBundleShortVersionString are ignored in the tiapp.xml file as they are auto-generated by Titanium. However, I am a believer that if I type a CFBundleVersion into that manifest, I should expect it to come out that way on the other end, and not get ignored & auto-generated.

I think auto generation is great, but when an override is defined, it should take that value.

Right now there's no way to release multiple builds for the same version of the app. Meaning, nobody can actively use TestFlight. If one wants to have multiple builds of the same version, you'd have to modify CFBundleVersion, but we don't have control over that. That means we have to create new version releases every time we need to upload a new build.
