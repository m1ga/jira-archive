   <h4>Please post the Studio log file.</h4>
   <h4>What happens if you try and delete the project outside Studio? Is a file in use?</h4>
   <h4>If so, which file?</h4>
   <h4>If it's a SDK bug, why is it in Studio? Does the same thing happen if you do it from the CLI?</h4></li>

   I have attached the Studio log. 
   I can delete the project outside Studio without any issues. 
   
   [~ingo], Since I don't have any issues in deleting project outside Studio, I can do nothing with CLI.</li>

   Praveen, thoughts?</li>

   [~ingo] I'm afraid this has to be do with permissions of the build_<platform> file that we introduced.</li>

   Moving to 3_6_X because logging to a file was removed from the 3_5_X branch.</li>

   FR:
   
   On a Windows computer:
   
   1. Using Studio, create a new mobile app project
   2. Build for any platform
   3. Close all open files from the project
   4. In the project navigator, right-click the project and choose Delete. It should be deleted without issue.
   5. Repeat steps 1 & 2. Confirm that a build_platform.log file was created and contains the log output that was also sent to the console.
   6. Delete the project, again, there should be no errors.
