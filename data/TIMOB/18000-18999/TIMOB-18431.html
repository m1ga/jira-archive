<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Issue Description</h4>
With the 3.5.0.GA TiSDK the Ti.getVersion() function only returns the first 3 digits of the TiSDK so it returns 3.5.0 even though its using a custom SDK like 3.5.0.GA.FIS TiSDK. It would be great to have this fixed in the next Maintenance release like 3.5.1 if possible. 

<h4>Test Case</h4>
<code><pre>
(function() { 

Ti.API.error("Get Version: " + Ti.getVersion()); 

})(); 
</pre></code>

<h4>Console Output</h4>
<code><pre>
[INFO] :   Test/1.0 (3.5.0.0014f83)
[INFO] :   [object ComAppceleratorApmModule] loaded
[INFO] :   Get Version: 3.5.0
</pre></code>

   What is the reason why we wouldn't return the full version number?  The developer can always choose to truncate. </li>

   So its not a regression then?  What was the reasoning for the change?</li>

   It must be more work to NOT return the original value - please sir can I have my revision code back.</li>

   Okay, this seems like we should do this based on feedback. Does this apply to Android as well?</li>

   Just to note: Both iOS and Android returns 3 digits currently.</li>

   Ti.getVersion returns the version number based on the file here */build/titanium_version.py* in the titanium_mobile repo.
   This has been tested on the latest master branch on iOS and Android.
   Basically, for any custom SDK built based on our titanium_mobile, you just have to change the version string in this file, execute scons to compile, subsequently calling this method based on the packaged build, will return the custom version string.
   We will not make any changes to our usual convention of putting a 3 digit string here, so as not to cause behavior change. 
   Developers who needs this for their customised SDK can just use the method I described here.

   If this is acceptable, will be closing ticket on Friday 12 June.</li>
