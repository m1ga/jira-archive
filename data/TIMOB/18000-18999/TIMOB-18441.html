<h3>Description</h3>

There is a need to override the keystore signature algorithm. Today we autodetect the signature algorithm using keytool, however there is a scenario where the SHA256withRSA signature algorithm is detected when it should be SHA1withRSA.

A way to deal with this is to simply add a new command line option: <code>\-\-keystore\-sigalg</code>. It does not have a default "value", but the default behavior will be to continue to do what we do today. When the <code>\-\-keystore-sigalg</code> is specified, it would simply override the detected signature algorithm before calling <code>jarsigner</code>. This change would take place here: <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/blob/master/android/cli/commands/_build.js#L4096." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/blob/master/android/cli/commands/_build.js#L4096.</a>

   Hey Chris! I noticed this is scheduled for 6.1.0. Looking at the source, you already implemented a <code>-sigalg</code> parameter [here](<a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/blame/master/android/cli/commands/_build.js#L4230)." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/blame/master/android/cli/commands/_build.js#L4230).</a> That was in 2014 and this ticket was created in 2015, so I'm a bit curious. Thx!</li>

   When Android 4.3 came out and some devices, specifically I believe it was a Sony smartphone, that didn't ship support for apps signed using the "SHA1withRSA". "SHA1withRSA" and "MD5withRSA" are the most common. This Sony device only supported "SHA256withRSA" and maybe "MD5withRSA". I added a warning if I detect the use of "SHA256withRSA": <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/blame/master/android/cli/commands/_build.js#L297." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/blame/master/android/cli/commands/_build.js#L297.</a>
   
   We try to determine the <code>sigalg</code> from the keystore, but in the event we can't, we default to "MD5withRSA". By now, I assume all devices support "SHA256withRSA" and perhaps that should be the new default?
   
   I'm not sure how relevant this is ticket is anymore. I haven't heard much noise regarding the signing algorithm, however adding a <code>\-\-keystore\-sigalg</code> option is super easy.</li>

   Putting out ouf SDK 6.1.0, since only Android 4.3 and later do support the <code>SHA256withRSA</code> algorithm. If people want to use it anyway, they can already by passing the <code>-sigalg SHA256withRSA</code> option to the APK signing process.</li>

   Hi, guys.
   I sent a PR.
   This is a very simple change, therefore this is no reason not to provide.
