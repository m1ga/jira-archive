<h3>Description</h3>

There's two issues with the generated CMakeLists.txt from our template:
- nested folders are using slashes in the variable name, rather than replacing all slashes with underscores (only the first is getting replaced, not all slashes)
- The incorrect slash is being used to designate the destination relative path inside the app. We need to use '\', but are using '/'.

As a result when we try to build the app in Visual Studio it will complain about being unable to find files that do exist.

   To test:
   1. You must install the Titanium CLI from the git master branch: <code>npm install -g git://github.com/appcelerator/titanium.git#master</code>
   2. You must install Titanium SDK from master: <code>ti sdk install -b master -d</code>
   3. You must copy the titanium_mobile_windows/templates/build/CMakeLists.txt.ejs from the PR into the SDK/windows/templates/build.
   4. Generate an app that has at least two levels of folders deep underneath Resources. (i.e. Resources/alloy/controllers/index.js) I believe the standard alloy two tab app might work here.
   5. Run <code>ti build -p windows -T wp-emulator -C 8-1-1 --wp-publisher-guid 00000000-0000-1000-8000-000000000000</code></li>

   I can successfully build and run an Alloy-based app. I tested using both a single-window app containing just a label, and a single-window app that used <Require> to include a view from the views/extras/mylabel.xml file.
