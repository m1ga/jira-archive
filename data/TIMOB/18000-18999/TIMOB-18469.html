<h3>Description</h3>

Currently HAL is a C++ <-> JavaScriptCore bridge. We need to convert this to connect to V8.

   why do this? Didn't Appc already port JSC to Android or was that approach completely abandoned? <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/hyperloop/wiki/Shrinking-JavaScriptCore" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/hyperloop/wiki/Shrinking-JavaScriptCore</a></li>

   [~sophrinix] Thanks for reminding me of this comment. The utility of this is to make it easier to use HAL in ti.current for modules for Android.</li>

   @ingo I am not sure the reason for making that call, but I know personally I would rather see effort directed to just getting Ti.Next out the door vs Ti.Next type features in Ti.Current.
   Just my vote... not that I get one :) </li>
<li>Ingo Muschenetz 2015-04-08

   [~mapperson] One of the major requests by customers is for Ti.Current and Ti.Next is to use native APIs directly in JavaScript. I see this as part of that effort, and I don't believe detracts from the overall goals.</li>
<li>me@gmail.com 2015-04-08

   I 100% want that in Ti.Next. Why Ti.Current though? I mean it would be nice, but at the expense of a delay to getting Ti.Next out the door? 
   To me this seems like a lot of effort to add a feature to Ti.Current, what will (hopefully soon?) be a legacy codebase.
   
   Am I just over estimating the effort needed to do this?</li>
<li>Ingo Muschenetz 2015-04-08

   I can't commit to a definite level-of-effort here yet without a bit more investigation, however I do recognize your concerns and will keep them in mind.</li>
<li>me@gmail.com 2015-04-08

   Is the plan to support BOTH JSCore AND V8 or just V8 on android?</li>
<li>Ingo Muschenetz 2015-04-08

   It depends on several factors so I can't say for sure. The long-term preference is a single JS engine across all platforms, but again, depending on effort, there may be strong rationale for supporting multiple version in the interim.</li>
<li>me@gmail.com 2015-04-08

   I know the Ti.Forward effort is happy to maintain or help maintain the JSCore version... for what that is worth.</li>
