<h3>Description</h3>

During compilation of titanium_mobile, we have a number of errors like:

"[javac] warning: android/text/method/DialerKeyListener.class(android/text/method:DialerKeyListener.class): major version 51 is newer than 50, the highest major version supported by this compiler.
[javac] It is recommended that the compiler be upgraded."

The current version used for compilation is JDK 6. Recommend upgrading to JDK 7.

This is a tooling ticket (as opposed to a DevOps ticket) as it _could_ have ramifications on Android.

   Tried doing this (had to use JDK8), and got the following:

   It appears there are at least a few issues to resolve.</li>

   JDK 1.7 was EOL'd in March with the end of updates in April. Any chance we'll see support for 1.8 soon?

   [~skypanther] This ticket is for using JDK 1.8 for compilation of the SDK. Is that what you are interested in?</li>
<li>Tim Poulsen 2015-06-01

   Yep. I had to downgrade the version of the JDK on my computer to build the SDK from source. </li>
<li>Christopher Williams 2015-09-30

   I cloned off a blocking ticket for fixing the JDK 8+ compile issue: TIMOB-19648
   
   That ticket has an open PR against master. Once merged, I assume we can update the JDK on the build server (for master builds).</li>
