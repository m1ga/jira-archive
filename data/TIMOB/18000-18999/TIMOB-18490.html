<h3>Description</h3>

We need to include Google Play Services in our module. We do so by including the google-play-services.jar in the lib folder, all the appropriate resources, and specifying the Play Service version metadata tag in the manifest. However, if an app needs to use our module and the Ti.Map module,  it will fail to compile do to the Jar mismatch. (Our module is including the latest lib, but Ti.Map is currently including revision 21).

To get around this issue, we will not include Play Services in our module but instead direct users to include the Ti.Map module even though they may not be using maps, as this will add the appropriate Play Services library to their app.

Is it possible to include Google Play Services at the app level and not the module level?
