   Yes, please find a replacement before deleting the "demo" project. We work with the <code>iphone/iphone/Titanium.xcodeproj</code> 95% of the time, and the project located in the "demos/KitchenSink" is the one linked to that Xcode project. We could create an empty project or create a fork of the official KitchenSink repo and link it so that it is always up to date.</li>

   We should remove the directories and link the submodules of the above mentioned git repositories to the project.</li>
<li>Chris Barber 2016-05-22

   [~hansknoechel] We should move the demos to a separate repo, but I strongly feel that we should NOT submodule the demos. What would be the point in that? The demos are out-of-date. With Alloy becoming a first-class citizen, those demos become even more useless.</li>
<li>Hans Knöchel 2016-05-22

   Its just one thought. Obviously, we just need the app.js in 95 % of the iOS development - to test new API's and reproduce existing ones. Besides that, the KitchenSink should become famous again, Alloy based. Fokke currently works on a Windows Phone sample application that is meant to replace it on the long term. But as we still have issue running Alloy projects from Xcode and need to copy over everything manually, I'm not sure if that doesn't bring even more problems. So what would you propose?</li>

   [~hansknoechel] In Titanium 6, I'm going to see about putting the assets in the Xcode project. This will allow you to open the Xcode project and conduct your work. This means that the Titanium app that you will use for iOS dev will be in the same directory as the Titanium.xcodeproj.</li>

   Resolving ticket as Invalid as there is now a new version of Kitchen Sink available and we no longer support the version which relates to this ticket.</li>
