<h3>Description</h3>

When creating a new Titanium app, it sends an analytics event to the server with values from the tiapp.xml and command line args.

It's possible to create an app where the some of these required values are missing.

For example, you could try to create an app using a custom <code>\-\-template</code> where the template is missing a tiapp.xml. Because the tiapp.xml is missing, there is no default value for fields such as "publisher". This causes analytics to fail.

Analytics requires the following fields:

* guid
* runtime
* name
* appid
* date
* publisher
* url
* version

We must ensure that these fields are at least empty strings.

Furthermore, we must also ensure that these fields are strings. It's possible to create a new app and specify <code>\-\-url</code> twice and the values are turned into an array which would need to be shifted into a single value string.
