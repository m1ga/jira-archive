<h3>Description</h3>

After creating a new project (Alloy or Classic) on Mac, I am unable to build the project. I get the below error:
<code><pre>
events.js:72
        throw er; // Unhandled 'error' event
              ^
Error: EACCES, open '/Users/ewieber/Documents/Appcelerator_Studio_Workspace/sdk test run/build/build_iphone.log'
</pre></code>

*Steps to reproduce issue*:
1. Create a new project with SDK 3.6.0.v20150203071743
2. Build the project for simulator
3. Notice that the above error is shown and an empty build folder is created.

*Expected Results*:
The project is able to build.

*Notes*:
Cleaning the project has no change on the issue. I was able to make the project build by selecting a 3.5.1 SDK, building, changing the SDK back to 3.6.0.v20150203071743 and building again.

   What version of the CLI are you running?</li>
<li>Ingo Muschenetz 2015-02-03

   Going to guess this is a CLI issue?</li>
<li>Eric Wieber 2015-02-03

   CLI version 3.4.1</li>
<li>Ingo Muschenetz 2015-02-03

   [~ewieber] please try 3.6.0</li>

   [~fmiao] perhaps you can take a look?</li>
<li>Chee Kiat Ng 2015-02-04

   [~fmiao], maybe something to do with permissions on the build folder. I manually changed it to read / write and it was able to build. Not sure if it's the whole reason.</li>

   [~cng] Yes it is. </li>

    Verified working as expected using:
    
    Titanium SDK 4.0.0.v20150206131709
    Studio 4.0.0.201502041613
    Xcode 6.2b5
    
    On: 
    iPhone 6 Plus, iOS 8.2b5
    iPhone 5S, iOS 8.1
    
    Projects can be created and built normally.</li>
