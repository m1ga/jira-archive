<h3>Description</h3>

I am working on creating formatting files for all languages we use regularly at Appcelerator, as well as configuration files for static/dynamic analysis

Iâ€™d like to create one for JavaScript. We have a standards guide here, but I want to create a complete set: 
<a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#</a>!/guide/JavaScript_Coding_Standards

* A file we can use to format JavaScript ourselves in our favorite editor
* A command-line tool we can use to validate that JS has been formatted correctly in PRs from contributors
* An updating of the JavaScript standards in Studio to match so that promote this style in our own products as well.

The tools should offer the following:

* node.js package
* Grunt plugin
* Sublime plugin
* Atom plugin
* Gulp plugin

Review the list of capabilities across these tools and put a checkmark in each column where it has that ability:

<a href="https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/eng/JavaScript+Tooling" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/eng/JavaScript+Tooling</a>

For the tool with the most capabilities, create a formatting file and check it into 

<a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/appc-standards/tree/master/languages/js" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/appc-standards/tree/master/languages/js</a>

   If we're entertaining the idea of using tools that support more than one editor, then I suggest we entertain tools that support Gulp.</li>

   It appears that gulp is has plugins for the tools I highlighted in the wiki doc.</li>
