<h3>Description</h3>

It's challenging to manually update the current automation status for all of our repositories. I recommend we augment travis.appcelerator.org to highlight the following items. Suggestions on how to implement this are inlined:

* Repo is a "client" project
** use appc-client as keyword in package.json
* Repo on CI build
** Easy to check travis. How to check a repo is built with Jenkins?
* CI build status
** Easy for travis, how about Jenkins?
* Container-based travis build
** check for sudo: false in .travis.yml
* Unit tests
* Unit test run as part of CI
** check for NPM test as part of .travis.yml
* Performance tests
* Performance tests run as part of CI
* Code coverage
* Code coverage run as part of CI
* Code analysis
* Code analysis run as part of CI
* Automatic deployment of development builds
** Could use travis for this where appropriate
* Automatic deployment of pre-release builds (alpha, beta, etc)
* Automatic deployment of release builds
** Can check .travis.yml deploy section for providers
