<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Description</h4>

*This does not occur in Studio*

When attempting to build using LiveView from the CLI, opening the app fails on both iOS and Android. On iOS the build fails with a runtime error as shown below

<code><pre>
[ERROR] Script Error Couldn't find module: localeStrings for architecture: arm64
</pre></code>

and on Android it fails with a runtime error shown below

<code><pre>
[ERROR] TiExceptionHandler: (main) [9953,9963] ----- Titanium Javascript Runtime Error -----
[ERROR] TiExceptionHandler: (main) [0,9963] - In app.js:1,69
[ERROR] TiExceptionHandler: (main) [0,9963] - Message: Uncaught Error: [LiveView] File Server unavailable. Host Unreachable @ 172.16.0.170:8324
[ERROR] TiExceptionHandler: [LiveView] Please ensure your device and computer are on the same network and the port is not blocked.
[ERROR] TiExceptionHandler: (main) [1,9964] - Source: ponseText:!1,c=!0;else if(r-(new Date).getTime()&lt;=0)throw i=!1,c=!0,new Error(
[ERROR] V8Exception: Exception occurred at app.js:1: Uncaught Error: [LiveView] File Server unavailable. Host Unreachable @ 172.16.0.170:8324
[ERROR] V8Exception: [LiveView] Please ensure your device and computer are on the same network and the port is not blocked.
[DEBUG] HTTPClient: The persistent handle is disposed.
</pre></code>

If LiveView is run through Studio then there are no errors. *This only occurs in the CLI*

This is because the *LiveView server is not started* when building from the CLI.

This *is a regression* as in previous versions of LiveView I was able to launch from the CLI with no errors.

<h4>Steps To Reproduce</h4>

1. Build an existing project in the CLI using the ti build command with --liveview 
2. Open the app on device

<h4>Actual Result</h4>

2. Depending on the platform the app will throw one of the errors shown above

<h4>Expected Result</h4>

2. The app should not throw an error, or LiveView should not be allowed to be used in the CLI

   Might be related to Node 0.12. A rebuild often fixes it but its annoying when using the CLI with LiveView.</li>

   It seems to be not just CLI, but also when used from Studio:

   Hi there.
   
   That was me.
   
   My environment is:
   
   Operating System
     Name                        = Mac OS X
     Version                     = 10.11
     Architecture                = 64bit
     # CPUs                      = 4
     Memory                      = 32.0GB
   
   Node.js
     Node.js Version             = 0.10.40
     npm Version                 = 1.4.28
   
   Titanium CLI
     CLI Version                 = 5.0.3
     node-appc Version           = 0.2.31
   
   I've run SDK 5.0.0.GA as well as 5.0.0.v20150920030708, still no joy.
   
   The particular app I am testing is iOS only, so I'm not sure if it's an android issue as well at this point.
   
   So far I only get this issue on the iOS simulator, seems to run on the device, although when it does the code reload it either crashes or (in my case because I have only landscape orientations in my tiapp.xml file) the app appears upside-down.

   I can reproduce this on <code>liveview@1.0.7</code> but not <code>1.0.8</code>. 
   Node: v0.12.7</li>
<li>Hans Knöchel 2016-10-18

   [~fmiao] so this is fixed nowadays?</li>
<li>Feon Sua Xin Miao 2016-10-18

   [~hansknoechel], are you able to reproduce the issue?  I wasn't.</li>
<li>Tobias Høegh 2017-01-26

   Node: v0.12 is not supported by apcl. any more. So I use Node v4.6.2  - but I'm getting this error:
   
   [ERROR] Script Error Couldn't find module: localeStrings for architecture: arm64
   
   I have the newest versions:
   Mac OS v10.12.2
   Ti CLI v5.0.11
   Ti SDK v6.0.1.GA
   Appc v6.1.0
   LiveView v1.0.9
   
   I got this error many versions back. So this is not a new thing.
   
   Any one have a solution?</li>
<li>Jason Kotchoff 2017-05-18

   Same issue.
   
   My Environment:
   Mac OSX - 10.12.4 - 64 bit
   Node: 2.14.7
   appc cli: 6.2.1
   Appcelerator studio: 4.8.1.201612050850
   Liveview: ? (not sure how to check - it would be whatever studio comes with)
   
   After cleaning out my build directory, trying to run my project with liveview on the iOS simulator failed with the error:
   
   {noformat}[ERROR] :   CompileC build/Intermediates/StockLight.build/Debug-iphonesimulator/StockLight.build/Objects-normal/x86_64/TiButtonUtil.o Classes/TiButtonUtil.m normal x86_64 objective-c com.apple.compilers.llvm.clang.1_0.compiler
   {noformat}
   
   On the face of it, this sounds similar to the error:
   [<a href="https://forum.ionicframework.com/t/cordova-cdvviewcontroller-h-file-not-found-in-xcode-7-1-beta/32232/47" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://forum.ionicframework.com/t/cordova-cdvviewcontroller-h-file-not-found-in-xcode-7-1-beta/32232/47</a>]
   
   After subsquently building (successfully) without liveview, I tried liveview again on the iOS simulator and that error went again and I was instead presented with:
   
   {noformat}
   [ERROR] :  Script Error {
   [ERROR] :      column = 22;
   [ERROR] :      line = 586;
   [ERROR] :      message = "[LiveView] File Server unavailable. Host Unreachable @ 127.0.0.1:8324\n[LiveView] Please ensure your device and computer are on the same network and the port is not blocked.";
   [ERROR] :      sourceURL = "file:///Users/jason/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Devices/3B6D5E3C-00D3-41D0-BB83-730C04C51EE4/data/Containers/Bundle/Application/EEF0EBD0-326D-4FB1-8987-2F5AB5F43562/StockLight.app/app.js";
   [ERROR] :  }
   {noformat}
   
   
   As per:
   [<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35237172/can-we-use-appcelerator-titanium-liveview-in-ios-devices" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35237172/can-we-use-appcelerator-titanium-liveview-in-ios-devices</a>]
   
   I then tried running:
   
   {noformat}
    /Applications/Appcelerator\ Studio/plugins/com.appcelerator.titanium.liveview.core_1.1.0.1476939755/node_modules/liveview/bin/liveview server status
   {noformat}
   
   
   which correctly showed a single running server. I stopped it manually using that liveview command and then re-launched from Appcelerator Studio but again received the File Server unavailable error.
   
   Giving up.
