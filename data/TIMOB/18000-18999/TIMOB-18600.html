<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Description</h4>

When attempting to build to an Android emulator the build fails with.

<code><pre>
 [ERROR] :  TiExceptionHandler: (main) [9499,9499] ----- Titanium Javascript Runtime Error -----
    [ERROR] :  TiExceptionHandler: (main) [1,9500] - In app.js:567,13
    [ERROR] :  TiExceptionHandler: (main) [1,9501] - Message: Uncaught Error: [LiveView] File Server unavailable. Host Unreachable @ 172.16.0.216:8324
    [ERROR] :  TiExceptionHandler: [LiveView] Please ensure your device and computer are on the same network and the port is not blocked.
</pre></code>

I *do not believe this is a regression* as it has been reported in previous versions of LiveView

To workaround just disable LiveView and the build will be fine
 
Building to device with LiveView works fine and I am able to make changes with no errors
Checking the log output shows that the LiveView server has started 

<code><pre>
[LiveView] version 1.0.7
[LiveView] File Server Started on Port 8324
[LiveView] Alloy project monitor started
[LiveView] Event Server Started on Port 8323
</pre></code>


This issue is not reliant on a node version, it occurs in node 0.12 as well as 0.10.32
<h4>Steps To Reproduce</h4>

1. Build to an Android emulator from Studio with LiveView enabled

<h4>Actual Result</h4>

The build fails with the error above

<h4>Expected Result</h4>

The build should not fail and LiveView should be working as expected

   When I tried to reproduce on my machine, the app launches successfully with liveview on Android emulator (with 5.0.1). The issue seems to happen only on Android AVD with v4.4</li>
<li>Praveen Innamuri 2015-02-24

   I am unable to reproduce the app/simulator crash when I attempt to run app with liveview enabled on Android 5.x and 4.4 emulator.</li>
<li>Praveen Innamuri 2015-02-24

   This turns out to be happening randomly even on the previous Titanium stable release with Node 0.10.x.</li>

   What's the latest thoughts on this?</li>
<li>Ingo Muschenetz 2015-06-18

   We are going to defer this in favor of working on refactoring the debugger to work with the built-in JS Core.</li>

   This is not just Android. I can reproduce this with:
   
   * Mac OS X 10.10.4
   * NodeJS v0.12.0, v0.12.6
   * iOS Simulator 8.4, XCode 6.4
   * SDK 4.1.0.v20150701131146
   
   It works when I switch back to NodeJS v0.10.39 so it seems like its related to NodeJS?</li>

   Hello Everyone!
   
   This issue is still open? I was looking online for a solution to this issue and found an interesting consistency. It seems that on all of my Android 6.0 SDK emulators the liveview functionality doesn't work, BUT when I tried liveview with android 5.0.1 sdk emulators it worked. Please let me know if you guys can replicate this behavior.
   
   Here is some sytem info from my end:
   Host OS: Mac OS X
   OS Version: 10.10.5
   OS Arch: x86_64
   JRE Version: 1.8.0_72
   Appcelerator Studio Version: 4.5.0.201602170821
   XCode Version: 7.2.1
   Android SDK: I have both 6.0 and 5.0.1
   Node.JS Version: v4.3.1
   [LiveView] version 1.0.9
   
   also not sure if this matters, but I made some minor changes as specified in this link and wanted to make sure you could keep that in mind:

   [~mkellogg91@gmail.com] Thanks for the feedback. That's an interesting find, I'll get someone to take a look at it. We haven't addressed, or actually updated this ticket because we haven't been seeing this issue in the latest versions. </li>
<li>Ashraf Abu 2016-03-02

   Tried this with Android 6.0 on a Nexus 6 with 5.2.0.GA with an Alloy application. Using Mac OS X. No issues for me.
   (If it matters, my node is v0.10.37)</li>
<li>Ingo Muschenetz 2016-03-02

    I didn't think we still officially supported Node 0.10.73. I thought we mandated 0.12.X and above?</li>
<li>Ashraf Abu 2016-03-02

    Will get my Node updated and check to see if this occurs.</li>
<li>Ashraf Abu 2016-03-02

    Updated node.
    Tried this with:-
    Node.js
      Node.js Version             = 0.12.10
      npm Version                 = 2.14.9
    Titanium CLI
      CLI Version                 = 5.0.6
    Titanium SDK
      SDK Version                 = 5.2.0.GA
    
    No issues. Works correctly.</li>

    I was using one of the Nodejs LTS installations hence the nodejs version: 4.3.1 I'm not sure if this would change my experience, but my suspicion is that it would. I've since gone out and installed nodejs 0.12.10 since I saw that others were using that instead. Also, since writing my previous post I am using Genymotion for Android emulators and they only support up to android build 22 (sdk 6.0 is build 23 and build 23 was what I was previously having trouble with). At any rate I have my liveview working now.</li>
<li>Simon Buckingham 2020-01-02

    This is still a problem. There is more than 1 ticket for this problem so not sure which one is the most up to date. It mainly happens when switching between using LiveView on the iOS simulator and then trying Android in Genymotion (or vice-versa as iOS can stop working too). Try Android using Genymotion and get:
    [ERROR] TiExceptionHandler: Error: [LiveView] File Server unavailable. Host Unreachable @ 192.168.0.12:8324
    [ERROR] TiExceptionHandler: [LiveView] Please ensure your device and computer are on the same network and the port is not blocked.
    I have tried:
    - resetting and closing  the iOS simulator (which sometimes seems to work, but can't see any pattern)
    - $ killall node
    - Restarting Genymotion
    - Running the Android project for the first time without the --liveview flag
    - Quitting the terminal
    
    PS Using Ti SDK 8.3.0
    PPS If I start afresh in the morning after a computer startup it seems to work on the first platform that I test on eg Android or iOS. So there is obviously something that has to be reset for this to work. 
    
    Is this a node problem? I have node version 8.16.2</li>
