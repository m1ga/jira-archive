<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Description</h4>

When navigating to the LiveView folder within the Studio plugins and running the command ./liveview-server status all the LiveView servers that have been started since LiveView was installed are listed. 

However if you run *ps aux | grep node* it will show only one or none LiveView processes running.

If you try to kill the servers using ./liveview-server stop then it will attempt to kill the servers and will print out the following for each server.

<code><pre>
[LiveView]  Closing file/event server process id: 10716
[LiveView]  Error closing server { [Error: kill ESRCH] code: 'ESRCH', errno: 'ESRCH', syscall: 'kill' }
</pre></code>

<h4>Steps To Reproduce</h4>

1. From Studio build a few projects with LiveView enabled, making sure to terminate them once the app has launched and LiveView has connected
2. Navigate to the LiveView folder at /Applications/Appcelerator_Studio/plugins/com.appcelerator.titanium.liveview.core_1.1.0.1424300841/node_modules/liveview/bin 

3. Run ./liveview-server status
4. Run .ps aux | grep node
5. Run ./liveview-server stop

<h4>Actual Result</h4>

3. Multiple liveview servers will be listed
4. Only one liveview server will be shown as running, as expected
5. LiveView will attempt to kill the servers but it will fail

<h4>Expected Result</h4>

LiveView should not list inactive servers as active

   This is still an issue. Just discovered it, but nothing changed in performance of my machine after killing about 40 servers (you would expect cpu/memory usage drop). Got the error too. </li>
