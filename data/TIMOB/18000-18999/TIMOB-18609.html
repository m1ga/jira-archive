<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Description</h4>

When building an application to device and then opening and closing a window the message 'Window: Window is closed normally'. If the window is opened and closed multiple times then the messaged is printed out equal to the number of times it has been opened and closed.

This is *not a regression* as it occurs in 3.5.0.GA SDK

The logging appears to be coming from line 72 in *android/modules/ui/src/js/window.js*

If the app is packaged and installed onto device then the code at that line is not executed as the if statement does not trigger

For example, see the below log output where I have opened and closed the window 3 times

<code><pre>
[DEBUG] :  Window: Checkpoint: postWindowCreated()
[DEBUG] :  Window: Window is closed normally.
[DEBUG] :  Window: Checkpoint: postWindowCreated()
[DEBUG] :  Window: Window is closed normally.
[DEBUG] :  Window: Window is closed normally.
[DEBUG] :  Window: Checkpoint: postWindowCreated()
[DEBUG] :  Window: Window is closed normally.
[DEBUG] :  Window: Window is closed normally.
[DEBUG] :  Window: Window is closed normally.
</pre></code>

<h4>Steps To Reproduce</h4>

1. Add the attached app.js to an existing project
2. Build the app to an Android device
3. Tap the button to open a window
4. Use the Android back button or the 'Close window button' on screen
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4

<h4>Actual Result</h4>

4. The window will close '\[DEBUG] :  Window: Window is closed normally.' will be printed in the console. As expected
5. For each time you repeat the above steps the number of log message will increase

<h4>Expected Result</h4>

5. There should only be one of the above log messages shown when a window is closed

   Verified fix on: 
   
   Mac OSX 10.10.2
   Appcelerator Studio, build:  4.0.0.201502171827
   Titanium SDK build:  4.0.0.v20150303161012
   Titanium CLI, build: 3.5.0-dev
   Alloy: 1.5.1
   Android build tools: 21.1.2
   Nexus 5 (5.0.1)
   
   When closing a window the log message is now printed only once each time.
   
   Closing ticket.

   Hi Titanium Support Team,
   
   Is it meaning that i have to wait for Titanium SDK version 4.0.0? Because it was not published yet!
   
   Thank you.</li>
