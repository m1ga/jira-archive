<h3>Description</h3>

Files added in a project with 'url' are not allowing break points to be hit. This is not a regression as I also see it with 3.5.0.GA.

*Steps To Reproduce*:
1. create app with code below.
2. Put a breakpoint on any line in newWin.js file.
3. Run the app.
4. Click Test button.

*Actual*: Breakpoint is not recognized in newWin File.

*Expected*: Breakpoint must get hit.

app.js
<code><pre>
var win = Ti.UI.createWindow({
  backgroundColor: 'blue'
});
 
//var ui = require('ui');

var button = Ti.UI.createButton({
  title: 'Test',
  top: 20,
  height: 50,
  width: 200
});
button.addEventListener('click', function(e){
  var newWin = Ti.UI.createWindow({url:'newWin.js'});
newWin.open();
});
win.add(button);
win.open();
</pre></code>

newWin.js
<code><pre>
var win = Ti.UI.currentWindow;
win.backgroundColor = 'white';
var x = 1;
Ti.API.info("hi");
</pre></code>

*Notes*:
See related ticket. Looks like this was fixed for Android in the past and iOS was verified. Possibly broke since then.

   Why isn't this issue getting more attention? How do you expect developers to stick around when we can't debug?</li>
<li>Martin Williamson 2015-07-14

   Please resolve this, we have to go back to run on SDK 3.4.1 if we need to debug any code which is ridiculous, we should be able to debug on the latest SDK, some code breaks between these SDKS so keeping the build working between debug and live is a nightmare</li>

   FWIW, we will likely implement TIMOB-16985 in the near future and focus on fixing the regression in TIMOB-18616 instead. Is there a reason you can't switch to using require?</li>
<li>Martin Williamson 2015-07-15

    I am using require, breakpoints / debugging still don't work in alloy projects above SDK 3.4.1
   
   Not sure if related but requires used in alloy.js
   Other views and controllers created add hoc on an action (i.e. button click invokes new controller with view)</li>

   Hi, I just tried to reproduce and the breakpoint is hit as expected. This is my environment: 
   
   Ti SDK 5.1.0.GA 
   Studio 4.4.0 
   IOS 9.1 / Xcode 7.1 
   Node.js 
   Node.js Version = 4.2.2 
   npm Version = 2.14.7
   Appcelerator CLI 
   Installer = 4.2.2 
   Core Package = 5.1.0
   Titanium CLI 
   CLI Version = 5.0.5 
   node-appc Version = 0.2.31
   
   Btw, take note that Ti.Window.url property is deprecated and will be removed in the next release.</li>

   I have since found this seems to be an issue when there is a space in the application name, if i remove the space it works as expected, if there a space in the app name it does not hit any breakpoints on iOS only.</li>
<li>Chee Kiat Ng 2015-11-25

   I believe the space issue has been fixed recently hence this ticket just have been fixed then</li>
