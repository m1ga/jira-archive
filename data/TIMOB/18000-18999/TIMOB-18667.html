   I think this is related to 0.12 and SDK 3.5.0.GA.
   We probably can't do anything like it.
   There is a valid message in the console so maybe it's OK.</li>

   for appc cli, i just made changes to always make sure that you have the latest SDK when you run appc setup (if not already the active version).  before it would only install if you didn't have ANY release (vs the latest).
   
   this at least gets around this specific issue when using new CLI.
   
   since this is probably a known issue (mismatch for titanium and SDK with node 0.12), i'm fine if you guys want to close this.

   Thanks [~jhaynie]. Along with installing the latest stable Titanium SDK, we might also need to set it as the selected SDK. Just want to confirm whether the changes also set the latest stable Titanium SDK as the selected.</li>

   I am unable to reproduce this issue with the following environment;
   Ti SDK 6.1.1 GA
   Appc NPM 4.2.9
   Appc CLI 6.2.2
   Ti CLI 5.0.14</li>
</ol>
