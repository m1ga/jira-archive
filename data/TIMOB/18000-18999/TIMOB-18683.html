   [~cng] Are we sure this works as expected with this PR in place?
   
   We had an email from a new customer worried that windows phone was showing a 27% coverage at:
   <a href="http://builds.appcelerator.com/mobile/master/mobilesdk-6.0.0.v20160120181659-parity.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://builds.appcelerator.com/mobile/master/mobilesdk-6.0.0.v20160120181659-parity.html</a>
   
   I imported the list in Excel, ignored all API namespaced for a specific platform and ended up with 63% as you can see in the attached document.</li>

   the % coverage = YES / (Total API)
   but in your excel, your % calculated was (YES + NO) / (Total API)
   
   So i think 27% makes sense. basically, just to clarify, this is saying that windows phone has 27% of the total API that includes methods, properties and events in parity with the entire Titanium API.</li>

   Marking as fixed since this PR was merged already in Mar 2015.</li>

   [~cng] in the excel I calculate YES + N/A where N/A is when the API is platform-specific thus can never be made available to that platform anyway. That's my actual point; by only counting YES you get a much lower score then what it should be. See TIDOC-2429 as well</li>
<li>Chee Kiat Ng 2016-02-03

   [~fokkezb] So following your idea, the total API in the parity report should actually ONLY consist of non platform-specific API (it should not contain non-parity .iOS or .android API etc). Then the parity % coverage will be higher. [~ingo] thoughts?</li>
<li>Fokke Zandbergen 2016-02-03

   It should include APIs we *have* implemented for that platform plus APIs what we *can never* implement simply because it's specific to another platform. That gives a more relevant (and indeed higher) % and the remaining APIs (those we *could* implement) is a more helpful list to work on improving parity.
   
   The way we calculate now Windows will never be 100% since we'll never be able to implement the Action Bar ;)</li>

   Closing ticket as fixed.</li>
