<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Description:</h4>
When I run an alloy or classic app in android emulator I see multiple "Choreographer" log INFO entries like so:
<code><pre>[INFO] :   TiRootActivity: (main) [0,0] checkpoint, on root activity resume. activity = com.appc.classic.ClassictestActivity@40ff8618

The frame number will vary. I have not see this type of INFO statement before.

<h4>Steps to reproduce:</h4>
1) Create a new project - alloy default or classic two-tab
2) Launch in android emulator
3) Monitor log

   Ash, can you take a look at this?</li>
<li>Ingo Muschenetz 2015-03-22

   [~emerriman] regression?</li>
<li>Ashraf Abu 2015-03-23

   Looking at this.</li>

   [~emerriman] May I know what kind of settings you are using for the emulator as well?
   Eg, Device, Target, CPU/ABU. Use Host GPU, RAM, VM Heap.
   
   Choreographer is only available on API16+ (JellyBean) so it shouldn't appear on devices and emulators below that.
   
   I'm using 4.0.0.v20150320224212. I get the following logs.
   <code><pre>
   [INFO] :   TiApplication: (main) [0,0] checkpoint, app created.

   </pre></code>
   
   On my emulator, I only get Choreographer twice with low number of frames being skipped.
   Could it just be that the emulator that you are using is really slow? 
   
   Choreographer only starts logging when the main thread is slow which occurs most of the time on emulators. Real devices normally work fine and hence, there's nothing for Choreographer to log about.</li>
<li>Ashraf Abu 2015-03-24

   Just a note:
   Tried this with:- 
   3.4.1.GA
   3.5.0.GA
   3.5.1.GA
   4.0.0.v20150320224212
   
   I get a consistent only 2 Choreographer logs with the classic app on my Emulator. Based on that, I think it's more on what kind (settings) of emulator a person is using. 
   
   Don't think it's a regression. [~emerriman], what do you think?</li>
<li>Chee Kiat Ng 2015-05-07

   Hi [~emerriman], any thoughts on [~msamah] comments? If it's ok i'll mark this as not reproducible by the end of this sprint. :)</li>
<li>Lee Morris 2017-03-23

   Closing ticket as "Cannot Reproduce" with reference to the above comments.</li>
