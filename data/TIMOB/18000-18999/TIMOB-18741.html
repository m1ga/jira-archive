<h3>Description</h3>

As of now, activity for a heavy weight window is created only when window.open() method is called. So we have to wait for the window open (OR) activity.onCreate event to do any changes on the action bar like,

1. Adding action items
2. Modify action bar properties 

When modifying action bar properties with the actionbarextras module (<a href="https://github.com/ricardoalcocer/actionbarextras)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/ricardoalcocer/actionbarextras)</a>, it becomes complicated or useless since we could easily recognise the flickering on action bar as soon the window is opened (For example, changing the background color of the action bar on window open event). 

The great solution could be, changing the way the activity is created, it should be created as soon the window is created (OR) expose the properties and methods on Ti.UI.Window / Ti.Android.ActionBar name space to set the values like action bar background color, font etc., and update them as soon activity is created. 

As of now Ti.UI.Window.title is updated in the same manner. Title can be set before opening the window but updated internally in TiBaseActivity.java as soon the activity is created.

   This sounds like a really great addon. Can this be (re-)scheduled? </li>
