<h3>Description</h3>

There are occasions where app developers may not want to send certain events to the analytics server. One example use case is that the app needs to enable location services, but not send geo events to PEM.

Our proposal is that in tiapp.xml (and also at runtime), the developer is able to set a list of events to filter out:

.filter("ti.geo", "app.nav")

We may wish to _not_ allow them to filter some events like ti.enroll if that then breaks down the rest of the analytics system.

   [~mgadiya] This was a request from Swire Beverage during the pre-sales phase.  They wanted to be able to collect Analtyics Events but disable any location tracking event types.  This is primarily due to privacy concerns.</li>

   If we have begun work, we should mark this as in progress.</li>

   Swire may no longer be in the mix so unless we feel others need this I don't think we should consider it a priority now.</li>

   I think it's still worth doing to address the Gulfstream issue. Thanks!</li>

   Reviewed both PRs, and left some comments. 
   Ti.Analytics.filterEvents(['eventName']) is tested to work on both platforms.
   *To note:* Currently on sdk, only *ti.geo* event is the only analytics event integrated in it.
   there is no nav events being sent to the server.
