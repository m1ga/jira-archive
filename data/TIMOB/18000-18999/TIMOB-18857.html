<h3>Description</h3>

As a developer / product owner / business analyst - I may be building or managing mobile applications a specific way for my organization. This management process may mean that when packaging my mobile app for Ad Hoc/Enterprise or even App Store / Google Store / Windows Store this build would be considered a "Test Build" vs actually production.

As such I need the ability to tag builds and build versions in a manner that would let me better filter them in the dashboard. 

Expectation:
When building / packaging the application there should be a way to tag that build as either development or production (or even a custom environment tag such as "Staging" or "QA") that could then be picked up by the dashboard and allow Dashboard Users to better filter their views at the aggregate and application level.
