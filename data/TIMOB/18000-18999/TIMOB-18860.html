<h3>Description</h3>

We have no notion of "null" primitive values. This is problematic when we have special arguments/parameter structs like MatrixCreationDict. It's also problematic if we want to check if a property has never been assigned a value (say color, on an animation).

We can use "default" values and check for those (such as empty string), but for double/int32_t, uint32_t that's often more problematic. We want to explicitly know if the user gave a 0/-1/whatever versus never having set a value.

There's the boost:optional type we could use, or we could simply make our own type.

   Sounds like that's a right place for <code>boost::optinal</code>. Is there any possible issues/concerns for it?</li>

   [~kota] I think boost::optional looks good enough to use. No reason to re-invent the wheel if they already have it and we already have a dependency on boost.</li>
