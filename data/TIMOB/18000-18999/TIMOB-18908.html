<h3>Description</h3>

9-patch splash screen images aren't showing up correctly in Android 5, they show black squares on the left side of the screen.

!housters-splash-bug.png|thumbnail!

On Android 4 they show up correctly and if I change to non-9-patch they work on Android 5. I've attached a sample 9-patch for reproducing.

   I'm observing this issue under Titanium SDK 5.1.1.GA on an Android device running Android 6.0 - Marshmallow on an application using 9 patch splash screens.  I'm currently updating the project from Titanium SDK 3.5.0.GA, this issue does not present on the version using the older SDK.  Same symptoms, there are those two black rectangles on the splash screen.  Older android versions display the splash screen correctly (tested on Samsung Captivate running Android 4.0.4 and Samsung Galaxy S 3 running 4.4.4).
   
   Has there been any progress made on this issue, or is there a known work-around (aside from moving away from 9 patches)?  It looks very sloppy to have an app launch with parts of the splash screen missing, I would rather not send this app to my client with the first piece of UI it displays broken on some devices.</li>

   I can reproduce it on a Nexus 7 running Android 5.1.1. Hieu, you tested with 5.0.0.GA and 5.0.2.GA, but did you try 5.1.0GA? I added you as a collaborator on the EngiWeek repo so you should be able to see it now.</li>

   I'm seeing the same two black boxes in Nexus 6 simulator, but on on Samsung S6 running 5.1.1, 9-slice launch image is just showing the top black area, middle black area is gone. Spent 2 hours troubleshooting before finding this thread...

   I have the same problem with my own images on my Galaxy S5. There are black boxes that appear over the splash screen </li>

   @James O'Leary,
   
   Thanks for the follow up, you're a life saver!  I've tested Fokke's work-around in my codebase and it resolves the issue for me as well.</li>
