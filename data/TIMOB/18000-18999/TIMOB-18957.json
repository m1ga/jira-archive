					"body": "One of the most valuable metrics for measuring the success of push campaigns are open rates. We should enable developers to track this without relying on what GCM/APNS support.. E.g. when the user opens a push notification we make an API call to the ACS backend marking the push as opened. We would also send some metadata (client os version, app version, client device, timestamp opened. This would update a flag in the push notification record. In turn we will be able to run analytics on top of it.\r\n\r\n(cc [~ngupta])",
