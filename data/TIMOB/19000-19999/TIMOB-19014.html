<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Description</h4>

*I will use this ticket to track any APIs that we come across during testing that the parity report shows as implemented but can not be found in the source code*

There appears to be inconsistencies between the parity report and what apis are actually implemented. For example the parity report show Ti.UI.textArea as implemented. However when trying to use the code below it errors with undefined is not a function for Ti.UI.createTextArea

<code><pre>
var win = Ti.UI.createWindow({
  backgroundColor: 'green'
});


var textArea = Ti.UI.createTextArea({
  color: '#888',
  font: {fontSize:10, fontWeight:'bold'},
  keyboardType: Ti.UI.KEYBOARD_NUMBER_PAD,
  returnKeyType: Ti.UI.RETURNKEY_GO,
  textAlign: 'left',
  value: 'I am a textarea',
  top: 60,
  width: 200, height : 70
});

win.add(textArea);
win.open();
</pre></code>

After a discussion with [~gmathews] we figured out that the stub has been generated for textArea in TitaniumKit, causing the parity report to believe it is implemented but it is not actually implemented yet. This will also lead to issues after release as the documentation will show this as being implemented when it is not.

*Below is a list of apis we believe are reported incorrectly*

||API||
| TextArea|

<h4>Steps To Reproduce</h4>

1. Using the above code build to a windows phone device or emulator

<h4>Actual Result</h4>

The app will throw an error saying undefined is not a function for Ti.UI.createTextArea

<h4>Expected Result</h4>

The parity report should reflect what is implemented
