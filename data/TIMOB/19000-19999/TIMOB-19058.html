<h3>Description</h3>

Import the Field Service sample (alloy) by using the latest Appcelerator Studio 4.1.0 release, through the dashboard. Then verify that you are able to build it for Win Phone and Store (after adding windows to list of deploy targets in tiapp.xml).

If you run into any issues, please file additional tickets. If the sample needs to be updated in any way (like enabling capabilities), file a PR for the sample.

   Do you have repository for the Field Service app, like [Sample.ToDo](<a href="https://github.com/appcelerator-developer-relations/Sample.Todo)?" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator-developer-relations/Sample.Todo)?</a></li>

   Huh, I can't seem to find where the original repo is... I'll have to do some digging.</li>

   [~kota] OK, so this sample is being deprecated/removed. So this isn't a priority anymore. I'll add in a ticket for checking the Movies app next sprint, since we should be close now with the recent Ti.Media proxies you've been working on.
   
   Additionally you did a nice job opening tickets for missing stuff from this sample, and I think Picker is a good proxy to get started on next, so TIMOB-19276 at just the TitaniumKit level is a good next step.</li>

   Field Service app is deprecated, and we have some good tickets related to things it did use that we haven't done yet. That's good enough for this.</li>

   Closing as invalid.</li>
