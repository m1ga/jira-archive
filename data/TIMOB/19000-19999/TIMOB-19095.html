   Dawson has been running on Windows 10.</li>

   I haven't seen anything like that before... Hmm. There's really no debugging information there for me to look at or begin to understand what's going wrong.</li>
<li>Fokke Zandbergen 2015-06-29

   Yes, there's nothing :( But it is consistent for me, also after doing a clean Windows 10 install. I also tried to add console logs to the line in longhorn but the wrapped callback is _undefined_ so I didn't get any further there as well.
   
   Now installing Windows 8.1.</li>

   I did have trouble running it in parallels, if I remember right. After I installed using Boot Camp everything worked fine for me.</li>

   I assume that many/most devs will work from Mac OS and to benefit from the single codebase will use Parallels or VMWare. So I hope we can somehow figure this one out and fix it.</li>

   [~fokkezb] I agree, but it seems really unstable at the moment. I had trouble getting even node and npm working right in parallels using default settings with the insider preview. </li>

   Should be done by TIMOB-19576</li>
<li>Ewan Harris 2015-11-03

   Verified using:
   
   Windows 10 Pro
   Appc Core: 5.1.0-42
   Appc NPM: 4.2.1
   Ti SDK: 5.1.0.v2015102819002
   
   Building to Windows Phone 8.1 device and emulator and Windows Local works when using Windows 10
   
   Closing ticket</li>

   [~kota]: I'm not sure what I'm suppose to document here for the SDK 5.1.0 release notes.</li>
<li>Kota Iguchi 2015-11-19

    [~bimmel] ok, I'll push a new PR or new ticket for the changes with detailed information.</li>
