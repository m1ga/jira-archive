<h3>Description</h3>

*NOTE* - This is a regression. Works fine with build 4.1.0.v20150629074136
<h4>Steps To Reproduce:</h4>
1. Create a default alloy or classic app for windows.
2. Build for windows device.

<h4>Actual Results:</h4>
1. The app launches, we see the appcelerator splash screen & the app crashes.
2. In the logs we get <code><pre>[ERROR] The remote procedure call failed.</pre></code>
3. We are not able to build for windows device because of this issue.

<h4>Expected Results:</h4>
1. The app should not crash after splash screen when launched on device & we should not see any errors.

   This appears to be due to encryption. Building to device with a deploy type of development does not throw this error(no encryption) and emulator with a deploy type of production throws this error (encryption)</li>
<li>Dawson Toth 2015-06-29

   Please provide the app you're trying to compile, too.</li>
<li>Ewan Harris 2015-06-29

   [~dtoth] this happens with a newly created project using <code>appc new</code>, building with either <code>appc run -p windows -T wp-device</code> or <code>appc run -p windows -T wp-emulator -D production</code></li>
<li>Lokesh Choudhary 2015-07-01

   Verified the fix.
   
   We can build to device successfully.
   
   Closing.
   
   Environment:
   Appc Studio: 4.1.0.201506261427
   Ti SDK:  4.1.0.v20150701131146
   Ti CLI: 4.0.1
   Alloy: 1.6.2
   Windows: 8.1 Enterprise 64-bit
   APPC NPM: 4.1.0-1
   APPC CLI: 4.1.0-4 
   Device: Nokia Lumia 928 - Windows Phone 8.1

   This is a regression as the issue does not occur on SDK 4.1.0.GA
   
   The issue occurs only on device and not on emulator with deployment type as development or production.
   
   Environment:
   OS: Win 8.1 enterprise - 64-bit
   Ti SDK: 4.2.0.v20150721230609
   Appc CLI core: 4.1.2
   Appc CLI npm: 4.1.0
   Device: Nokia Lumia 520 (v8.1)</li>

   [~ssekhri] This message is basically a generic crash and doesn't give any real details on why it failed. Do you know when this started happening? With what app? We sort of need to look at the recent changes and possible triggers to have idea why this might fail...
   
   Given that it works on emulator versus device, it's likely to be encryption related: cc [~dtoth]</li>

   [~cwilliams]The issue occurs for both alloy and titanium apps. It did crash on new default template apps. Also tried a sample app like Todo list and it did show the same behavior.
   The issue does not occur on 4.1.0,GA
   However, going back through builds on the master branch, found that the issue started occurring since the build 4.2.0.v20150721115805
   The build on the mater branch prior to it i.e. 4.2.0.v20150720183441 works fine.
   Surprisingly both these build have the same githash. So not sure what triggered the fail</li>

   Hi
   
   I am now experiencing this exact problem with almost all my apps, however very simple ones does not, I have for instance a few dummies. Did you have more info in this?</li>
<li>Christopher Williams 2015-08-13

   As stated, this is a very generic error which basically just means something went wrong during startup. If we can narrow the SDKs that worked versus when it started showing this error, we can narrow to the possible commits that may have caused it. According to Satyam, it looks like it started around July 20th/21st- so that likely means one of these commits may have caused the issue:

    Any update on this? 
    
    When I use 4.2.0.v20150720183441, I get "Error while require(./app) Can't find variable: _.
    
    No luck with anything else that I have tried, either, including the 9/9/15 5.0.0 CR. I get [ERROR] The remote procedure call failed.
    
    </li>

    [~mstarnes] Hi Mitch. The undefined "_" bug was fixed in TIMOB-19084 which is in the 5.0.x builds.
    
    As for the "remote procedure call failed" - this is a generic error which typically means that the app crashed during startup. The quickest way to diagnose this is to zip up the app and send it along to us so that we can run the app under the Visual Studio debugger with the debug/source of the Titanium libraries and pinpoint the exception/crash causing the issue. 
    
    You can email me to zip at cwilliams@appcelerator.com and I can convert it and try it out under the debugger to see what's going on.</li>
<li>Christopher Williams 2015-09-12

    Just a general comment for any users seeing this: This is a very generic error, and it's impossible to diagnose what _exactly_ is crashing without being able to get a copy of your app and running it under the debugger with the Titanium source code ourselves.
    
    It's likely that some API call being made on startup or setup of your UI is causing a crash. Unless we happen to have a sample app or unit test suite that mimics the same API usage we can't reproduce without your code to know what the root cause is.</li>
<li>Jörgen Buder 2015-09-13

    Agree, see this many times... among two is:
    
    You need to have the en-GB which was not needed in other targets.
    
    Do not use the app_name tag in strings.XML it conflicts with something is the windows builds... 
    
    Just for those ending up here... 
    
    regards</li>
<li>Ingo Muschenetz 2015-09-14

    Catch-all ticket, so marking this for 5.1.0 to keep track of it.</li>
<li>Kota Iguchi 2015-10-25

    Sounds like this relates to TIMOB-19745. [~gmathews] Thoughts?</li>
<li>Gary Mathews 2015-10-26

    I think this is something different since the app actually gets deployed to the device. I'll look into this.</li>
<li>Gary Mathews 2015-10-30

    Is anyone still seeing this? I can't reproduce it.</li>
<li>Kota Iguchi 2015-10-30

    I can't reproduce it too.</li>
<li>Kota Iguchi 2015-11-10

    This needs more info on how to reproduce this. Please create new ticket if this happens again.</li>
<li>Lee Morris 2017-06-14

    Echoing the above comments, any further problems please file a new ticket.</li>
