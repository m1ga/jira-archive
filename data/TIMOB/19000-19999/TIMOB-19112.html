<h3>Description</h3>

The [sample app I made for the 4.1.0.GA](<a href="https://github.com/appcelerator-developer-relations/appc-sample-ti410)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator-developer-relations/appc-sample-ti410)</a> has icons and splash screens [at the same place](<a href="https://github.com/appcelerator-developer-relations/appc-sample-ti410/tree/master/app/assets/windows)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator-developer-relations/appc-sample-ti410/tree/master/app/assets/windows)</a> and of the same sizes as [those in the default Alloy project](<a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/alloy/tree/master/platforms/windows/project/app/assets/windows)." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/alloy/tree/master/platforms/windows/project/app/assets/windows).</a> Still, the icon and splash screen showing in the emulator are the [defaults in the SDK](<a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile_windows/tree/master/templates/build/Assets)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile_windows/tree/master/templates/build/Assets)</a>, as the screenshots show.

   There's definitely a bug in the CLI, in that we copy Resources and Resources/windows over and _then_ copy the template from the SDK over top of that, so the template logos win.
   
   But I should also note that the splash screen still may not be overridden on phone with a fix (I don't think) - due to our use of a SplashScreen.scale-240.png. I believe SplashScreen.png is used for Windows Store (desktop/tablet) apps (and is centered on top of a chosen background color, which we've hard-coded into the app manifest template for now). The SplashScreen.scale-240.png would be used for a phone. (they're different dimensions, and as the name suggests, you can include different versions for different screen sizes/DPI).
   
   I think there's a bit of work around branding overall we'll need to do so users can set the splash background for store apps, set different splash screen images for phone/store with various scales, different tile logos (again with different sizes for when user chooses to make them take up more than single tile space).</li>

   Well, give me a list of the new load of icon/splash sizes and I'll add them to TiCons ;)
   
   They all should really look into supporting vector icons.</li>
