<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Problem</h4>
We are getting some unexpected behavior Integrating Optimezily with Appcelerator.
The app is not crashing so there are no errors around this, at least not in logs! But lets say we have a view with red background color, and want to change that view background color from red to blue (simple A/B test sample) and it's set on 50%-50%, so 50% of the installs will have this view with red background color and the rest will have it blue. 

There are several things going on here: 
1. The app doesn't load the correct background color. It keeps the original color even when it's loading the variation that supposed to have blue color. 
2. If it loads the blue color then some interactions reset the color. It loaded fine (blue color) but then on tap or scroll the background color resets to red. 

Those are 2 simple and common scenarios that came from basic testing this! Maybe the Ti proxies somehow overwrite the value set by Optimizely or something like that! 

<h4>Test Case</h4>
<a href="https://github.com/Alegt/movies" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/Alegt/movies</a> 
It's the movies sample from Appcelerator and have the Optimizely SDK integrated into a module! 

<h4>Steps to reproduce</h4>
To reproduce the issue you need to have an experiment set up and enabled on the Optimizely dashboard, add the keys and schema to the app in order to use it! I can't share our keys for that, sorry!

   Let's review this next sprint.</li>

   It'll help to understand how Optimizely is expected to work, you can try out Optimizely here: <a href="https://app.optimizely.com/mobile/test-it-out" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://app.optimizely.com/mobile/test-it-out</a>
   
   Also, you can create your own Optimizely account to see what's happening: <a href="https://www.optimizely.com/mobile/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.optimizely.com/mobile/</a></li>

   Hi - is there other information I can provide to help here?  Let me know!</li>
<li>Pamela Ongchin 2015-07-28

   Hi!  Is there a way you can update when you plan on working this?
   
   Please let me know!</li>

   I am sorry, but we are looking to integrate Optimizely with our app. 
   
   Could you give me some hint where to start? Do you go through SDK or through REST API? Do you have any module publicly available yet (even if imperfect/unstable)? </li>

   We don't have an optimizely module.
   If you are interested, you can check this out <a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#</a>!/guide/Creating_a_New_Titanium_Module
