<h3>Description</h3>

There is a need for the Titanium CLI to alter the available options and flags based on another option's value.

Today, we have hard coded support for "platforms". This is bad, but oh well. <code>\-\-platform</code> is an SDK level option, however the Titanium CLI itself will prompt for it and loads the platform specific options and flags.

This ticket is to add support for generic option branching.

On a side note, someday <code>\-\-platform</code> could be changed to use the option branching, but there would need to be special care to make sure the Titanium CLI remains backwards compatible with older SDKs.

   As of 7/16/2015, no Titanium SDK utilizes option branching, so you can basically test that I didn't break anything by running <code>ti build -h</code> and building any app for any platform.
   
   Eventually you'll be able to test this using the <code>ti create</code> command.</li>
