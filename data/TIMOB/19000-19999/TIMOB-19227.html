<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Problem Reproduce Step:</h4>
1. Created a simple Hello World app in the Appcelerator Studio 
2. Followed the walkthrough from [<a href="https://appcelerator.github.io/appc-docs/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://appcelerator.github.io/appc-docs/latest/#</a>!/guide/Integrate_a_Native_iOS_App_Extension_or_WatchKit_App]
3. Was able to debug/run the app in the Apple Watch Simulator 
4. But when trying to debug/run the app on the real devices Apple Watch


<h4>Expect Result:</h4>
Should work well like it run on simulator.

<h4>Actual Result</h4>
App never shows up on the device. The watchkit app shows up in the “Apple Watch” app on the iPhone, the option “Show App on Apple Watch” is on and status shows “installing…”. Unfortunately the installation never completes. 

<h4>Note:</h4>
Tried to just Run the app without debugging, removed the app, cleaned both Studio and Xcode, but still same error

<h4>Test Project:</h4>
[watchTest](<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/a05a7dzs3ni8sh6/watchTest.zip?dl=0)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.dropbox.com/s/a05a7dzs3ni8sh6/watchTest.zip?dl=0)</a>
Aslo you will need to go into the tiapp.xml and change the path to the watch extension project specific for your environment: 
<code><pre>
<extensions> 
<extension projectPath="/Users/alexyak/Documents/Work/appcelerator/watchTest/Watch/watchTest/">watchTest WatchKit Extension</extension> 
</extensions>
</pre></code>

   I am also having this problem.</li>
<li>Jason Priebe 2015-07-21

   I noticed that if I open the xcodeproj file in Xcode, there is a circle with a slash through it over the WatchKit App icon (under Extensions).  I don't know what that means, but it doesn't look good.
   
   The structure of the project created by Titanium is very different from the structure of the project that I created in Xcode to hold my watchkit app.  The Xcode project has four targets: the phone app, the watchkit extension, the watchkit app, and tests.
   
   The Titanium project has three targets: the app, an ipad build, and a universal build.  Not sure why those are set up like that; I thought our app was universal, as we target both ipad and iphone.
   
   But the extension is just found under an "Extensions" folder; it's not really a target.  Maybe that matters, maybe it doesn't.  If I knew, I'd probably be developing my app with Xcode!  :-)</li>

   Chris -- as you are working on this, if there is a workaround, please share it.  I don't mind mucking around with the xcode project as a stopgap measure to get the app installed properly.</li>
<li>Chris Barber 2015-07-21

   [~jpriebe] Yes! You betcha. I have a huge update that is about to land that fixes support for Watch Apps for both watchOS 1.x and 2.0 as well as Xcode 7, Node.js 0.12, io.js, and I sped up device builds by quite a lot. I'm racing to get this done ASAP, so please hang in there. It should land today or tomorrow.</li>
<li>Chris Barber 2015-07-28

   Well the good news is watch apps now install. Resolving as fixed.</li>
<li>Alex Yakhnin 2015-07-29

   So, how do I get a hold of this build?</li>
<li>Chris Barber 2015-07-29

   [~alexyak] You can download it by running:
   
   <code><pre>
   ti sdk install -b master
   </pre></code>
   
   or
   
   <code><pre>
   appc ti sdk install -b master
   </pre></code>
   
   Add the <code>-d</code> flag to make this SDK the default.
   
   NOTE: This build is VERY buggy. You will run into problems. I highly recommend you wait a couple more days for us to stabilize things.</li>
<li>Alex Yakhnin 2015-07-30

   Thank you Chris. You're right about instability of this build. It does't even compile/include the watch code....
   </li>
<li>Chris Barber 2015-07-30

   [~alexyak] Working on it! :)</li>
<li>Mancio Basoc 2015-09-01

    Hi Chris. We came about on this issue and installed the latest build as mentioned above however the issue still persists. Any other suggestions or fix that we should do on our end? We really need the fix on this issue ASAP. Thanks </li>
<li>Chris Barber 2015-09-01

    [~mancio] You need the latest everything. Latest appc cli, latest titanium cli, latest titanium sdk.</li>
<li>Kevin Milo 2015-09-01

    @Chris Barber: I have updated to the latest app-cli 4.1.2, titanium cli 4.1.5, and titanium SDK 5.0.0.v20150831163626. Now it doesn't even finish building using the command :
    <code><pre>appc ti build -p ios -T dist-adhoc</pre></code>
    No errors are showed. It stops at:
    <code><pre>...
    [INFO]  Processing Titanium symbols</pre></code>
    When I opened the generated Xcode project, the embedded WatchKit extension binary is not there anymore. Is there anything else I need to update?</li>
<li>Chris Barber 2015-09-01

    [~kevinm] I suspect your Titanium SDK is too old. There was a bug last night (TIMOB-19445) that broke things and it got fixed. Please update your Ti SDK and if you still have issues, create a new ticket.</li>
<li>Mancio Basoc 2015-09-02

    Thanks Chris for the fast response! I would just follow Kevin Milo's ticket for now. </li>
<li>Lee Morris 2017-03-16

    Closing ticket as fixed.</li>
