   We can easily generate Debug versions of the libs, I think the issue here is about bloating the size of the SDK by basically doubling the shipped libs.
   
   Zipped the latest build of the libs is 18 Mb, unzipped it's ~79Mb. Obviously shipping debug libs would roughly double that. Maybe it's just a matter of us switching from "Release" to "RelWithDebInfo" so the debug symbols are included?</li>

   This won't be welcomed by users because resulting SDK become huge (1GB). Basically Titanium developer don't need debug symbols because they don't have to debug HAL/TitaniumKit/TitaniumWindows. Closing.</li>
