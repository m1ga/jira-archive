<h3>Description</h3>

When using Xcode 7, I am unable to install to the iOS 9 Simulator when creating and building a project.

*Steps to reproduce*:
1. Set Xcode 7 as your selected Xcode version
2. Create a new project with <code>appc new</code>
3. Run the project on your iOS 9 simulator using <code>appc run -p ios -I 9.0</code>

*Actual Results*:
The simulator will launch but will never install the app (stays on 'Launching iOS Simulator')

*Expected Results*:
The iOS 9 Simulator installs and runs the app

*Notes*:
If using Xcode 6.4 or targeting a < iOS 9.0 Sim, I can run on Simulators as expected.
Not sure if this is an El Capitan only thing.

   I was unable to reproduce with the latest master build. I however did notice that it was autoselecting an iPad simulator which it should never auto select unless the device family is explicitly "ipad".

   This may have been an issue with the beta and my environment. Turns out Xcode was not recognizing any simulators, even iOS 8.X.I was able to get past this by removing everything in my ~/Library/CoreSimulator and /Library/CoreSimulator/Profiles folders. Xcode was then able to pick up the iOS 9 sims and I can install and run on them normally. Closing this ticket.
