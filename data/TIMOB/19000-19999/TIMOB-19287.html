<h3>Description</h3>

Generate a proof of concept for running Titanium API/apps on Apple Watch using JerryScript as the JS engine.

Ideally this would be able to leverage our existing iOS titanium_mobile, or TitaniumKit/HAL codebase. Perhaps a HAL-equivalent on top of JerryScript that would require minimal work to have TitaniumKit to work on top (be able to swap between the two engines easily)?

   So the good part in JerryScript I see is that API similarity between JavaScriptCore, which makes it easier to integrate with HAL-TitaniumKit API. I was able to build [HAL API on top of JerryScript](<a href="https://github.com/infosia/Daisy)." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/infosia/Daisy).</a> It actually runs pretty good on OS X. POC for TitaniumKit-WatchKit integration are done in [examples/JerryWatch](<a href="https://github.com/infosia/Daisy/tree/master/examples/JerryWatch)." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/infosia/Daisy/tree/master/examples/JerryWatch).</a> TitaniumKit are mostly working without changes, which is good. On WatchKit I was able to make it compiled, it executes TitaniumKit functions as expected, but immediately after that WatchKit freezes. It looks like root cause was from memory allocation in JerryScript. So I would say JerryScript is still early product but integration between HAL-TitaniumKit fits very well regarding architecture.</li>
