<h3>Description</h3>

The build fails on iOS device the second time without clean.

This is a regression as the issue does not occur with Ti SDK 4.1.0.GA

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a new project using "ti create"
2. Build the project to an iOS device. "ti build -p iOS -T device". The build and install happen successfully.
3. Again build the project to an iOS device. "ti build -p iOS -T device"

Actual Result:
An error is shown as follows:
<code><pre>
[INFO]  Installing app on device: AppcS iPhone6plus
[ERROR] Failed to install app on device (0xe8008019)
[ERROR] An error occurred during build after 9s 262ms
[ERROR] Failed to install app on device (0xe8008019)
</pre></code>

   The error code 0xe8008019 means you have a bad cert. If the iOS build detects this, it will print:
   
   <code><pre>
   Chances are there is a signing issue. Clean the project and try building the project again.
   </pre></code>
   
   I'm not sure what else we can do to fix this problem. Perhaps the provisioning is bad? Perhaps the cert isn't on the device?
   
   This was reported with a really old build. If you can reproduce this with a newer build, then feel free to reopen.</li>
