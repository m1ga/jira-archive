   The error 0xe8000005 is a MobileDevice error. Unfortunately, MobileDevice is a private framework and the meaning of 0xe8000005 is unknown. There are only a few error codes that we've actually figure out what they mean.
   
   Furthermore, SDK 4.2.0.v20150730093157 is very old. I'm not surprised you ran into this issue. Please re-test with the latest 5_0_X build.</li>

   I'm confused by this. Ad-hoc builds never installed to device as part of the build process. I was unable to reproduce this (the build was created as expected - still didn't install to device) using:
   
   Mac OS 10.10.3
   Alloy: 1.7.7
   Titanium CLI: 5.0.3
   Appc CLI: 5.0.0-51
   Appc CLI NPM: 4.2.0-8
   Titanium SDK version 5.0.0.v20150911123911
   Xcode 7 GM Seed
   
   The ipa installed and launched as expected on iPhone 6 running iOS 9 delivered with GM seed</li>

   Closing as unable to reproduce.</li>
