<h3>Description</h3>

Currently, titanium image related methods expect a local or remote url. Assets catalog work by finding the image based on just the name of the image.
So we have to modify the methods such that, it will first check if the assets catalog exist and contains the image, if it doesn't, then it will proceed as usual to treat it as a local or remote url.

   <h4>Test cases</h4>
   You can test these in KitchenSink Project
   1. Imageview should still be able to load blob (BaseUI/View/Image Views/Image Blob)
   2. Imageview should still be able to load remote url (BaseUI/View/Image Views/Basic)
   3. Imageview should be able to load TiFile (BaseUI/View/Image Views/Image File)
   4. Imageview should be able to load local image (Controls/Picker/Picker custom images)
   5. Imageview should be able to animate files (BaseUI/View/Image Views/Animated)
   6. Imageview should be able to load gif files (not in asset catalog) (BaseUI/View/Image Views/Animated)
   7. controls should be able to show images (everything in kitchen sink from tab bar to buttons)
   8. image view should load downloaded images (not in asset catalog) (BaseUI/View/Image Views/Image Blob)
   Outside of KitchenSink, in a new project:
   1. Test if changing images while keeping the same file name is shown in subsequent builds.
   
   For app thinning testing, refer to parent ticket, and use Fokke's sample app.

   Xcode 7.2 (7C46l)
   Node v0.12.7
   Java 1.7.0_80
   production
   
   All KitchenSink tests above passed, asset catalog is successfully created, and the sample app from the parent ticket was successfully thinned.</li>
