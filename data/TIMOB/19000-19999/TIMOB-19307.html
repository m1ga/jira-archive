<h3>Description</h3>

When navigating to and from a ListView that has a custom template, sometimes the view stays completely empty. This is a 100% reoccuring issue in our project when following these steps:
1. Open List View (content visible)
2. Navigate back (iOS Navigation bar back button)
3. Open List View (content not visible)
All further trys except for the second one result in the content being visible.

*This issue is only related to the newest version of the studio. Version 4.0 works fine.*

   I can confirm is a very common problem, already discussed in slack, many people had the same issue, but cannot find a way to reproduce it, is absolutely random.
   
   only with sdk 4.1.0 with listviews with custom layout</li>

   I'm having the same issue, blank screen, it doesn't raise an error, the content appears after going back and opening the window again... I't started happening after I upgraded the app to 4.1.0</li>
