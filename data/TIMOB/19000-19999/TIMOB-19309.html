<h3>Description</h3>

*Details:* With the latest SDK, you cannot install to an iOS device from Titanium CLI; you will get <code>Specified .app path is not a valid app</code> error message. And, if you do a <code>ti clean</code> and build to device again, CLI will install to iTunes.

*This is a regression from SDK 4.2.0.v20150729122818 i.e. was working on July 29.*

*Note:* *This will affect Appc CLI.*

*Steps to reproduce:*
1. Create a Titanium project
2. Install project to iOS device: <code>ti build -p ios -T device -l trace</code>

*Actual:* You are not able to install to device and the following error will appear:
<code><pre>
[TRACE] ** BUILD SUCCEEDED **
[INFO]  Finished building the application in 55s 880ms
[INFO]  Installing app on device: Spam
[ERROR] An error occurred during build after 1m 2s 944ms
[ERROR] Specified .app path is not a valid app
</pre></code>

3. Run <code>ti clean</code>
4. Install project to device again: <code>ti build -p ios -T device -l trace</code>

*Actual:* CLI will install to iTunes:
<code><pre>
[TRACE] ** BUILD SUCCEEDED **
[INFO]  Finished building the application in 46s 346ms
[INFO]  Installing application into iTunes
[INFO]  Initiating iTunes sync
</pre></code>

*Expected:* Should be able to install app to device.

   This occurs for me as well, using Xcode 7 and 6.4. It is currently blocking some of our watchkit testing.</li>

   Closing ticket as fixed. Verified that I was able to install to an iOS device (iphone 6 (8.2)) with latest master SDK build from both Xcode 6.4 and Xcode 7 (beta 4).
   
   Tested on:
   
   Ti CLI: 4.1.4
   SDK: 4.2.0.v20150805163626
   Node: v0.10.38
   OS: Yosemite (10.10.4)
   Xcode: 6.4, 7 (beta 4)
   Devices: iphone 6 (8.2)</li>
