<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Description:</h4>
While doing some testing, I had my personal device "Eric's 6" sitting on my desk. After a few test installs to a device called "newton" I got this error:
<code><pre>
[ERROR] :  Invalid "--device-id" value "08e438859cff384c07529d645ca188746afeb8c7"
Available iOS Devices:
  &lt;removed for privacy&gt;  Eric's 6
  itunes                                    iTunes Sync
For help, run: titanium help build
TRACE  | titanium exited with exit code 1
ERROR  | Error: ti run exited with error code 1
    at ChildProcess.&lt;anonymous&gt; (/Users/eric/.appcelerator/install/4.1.2/package/node_modules/appc-cli-titanium/plugins/run.js:84:66)
    at ChildProcess.emit (events.js:117:20)
    at Process.ChildProcess._handle.onexit (child_process.js:820:12)
</pre></code>

Since I didn't have my device connected I was surprised to see it in the list of available devices. Doing some investigation I noted that "newton" seemed to be available unreliably when this issue occurs. Meaning if "Eric's 6" is listed, "newton" may not be in the list. It was sometimes however, as shown here:
<code><pre>Connected iOS Devices
  Newton
    UDID                      = 08e438859cff384c07529d645ca188746afeb8c7
    Type                      = iPhone (#3b3b3c)
    iOS Version               = 8.0.2
    CPU Architecture          = arm64
  Eric's 6
    UDID                      = &lt;removed for privacy&gt;
    Type                      = iPhone (#3b3b3c)
    iOS Version               = 8.3
    CPU Architecture          = arm64</pre></code>

*Please note:*
iTunes wireless sync was not enabled, and iTunes running did not have an effect on this issue.
My device is on the same wifi network. When wifi is turned off on the phone it isn't visible to "appc info"
"newton" device is mostly not available when my phone is awake and listed in the appc info output

<h4>Steps to reproduce:</h4>
1) Connect a device via cable to test machine running Mac OS 10.10.x or better
2) run command <code><pre>appc ti info -t ios</pre></code> - verify device is visible
3) Using additional device connected to same wifi as Mac system, wake it up
4) run <code><pre>appc ti info -t ios</pre></code>

<h4>Result:</h4>
Physically connected device is no longer shown in output. Wireless device is listed in output but can't be installed to.

<h4>Expected Result:</h4>
Only physically connected devices are shown in "appc ti info" output
