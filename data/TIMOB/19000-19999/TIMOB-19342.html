<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Issue Description</h4>

scrollEnd/scrollend event is not getting fired in a ScrollView for Andrioid. On iOS is working perfectly. This issue was tested on Titanium SDK 3.5.1.GA, 4.0.0.GA, 4.1.0.GA classic version and Alloy

<h4>Expected behavior</h4>
The ScrollEnd event must be fired at the bottom or top of the ScrolView after scroll in Android. 


<h4>Steps to Replicate: </h4>
1. Grab sample code and throw it to app.js 
2. Run the app for android
3. Scroll to the bottom of the view
4. The event is not getting fired to show the alert text

   According to the doc, "scrollend" is not supported for Ti.UI.ScrollView: <a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#</a>!/api/Titanium.UI.ScrollView-event-scrollend
   Looking at the code, Android currently does not support this event.
