   [~cng] What kind of extensions should we support? Action extensions? Custom keyboard extensions? Document provider extensions? Photo editing extensions? Share extensions? Today extensions? Content blocker extensions? Shared link extensions? Spotlight index extensions?
   
   Do we go with a combo \-\-type iosextension and a \-\-extension-type <whatever> \-or\- should we have \-\-type ios-extension-custom-keyboard and so on? I don't want to use \-\-template since \-\-template is generally not a list of items, but rather the name of a template or a path to a template.</li>

   [~cbarber], sorry i thought extensions was generic. Now that i understand there are different types, I like to resolve this ticket for now, until there's a demand for a specific kind, considering we have other priorities at the moment. 
   
   And I agree if one day we are going to support this, I'll prefer to go with <code><pre> --type ios-extension-custom-keyboard </pre></code> since i don't think we will support all kinds.</li>
