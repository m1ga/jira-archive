   [~msamah], can you take a look?</li>
<li>Ashraf Abu 2015-08-26

   [~lchoudhary] What Java version are you using to compile this?
   
   I've got a feeling it has something to do with the version you are using as the screenshot shows "only available if source level is 1.5 or greater"</li>
<li>Lokesh Choudhary 2015-09-02

   [~msamah], I am using java 1.8.0_25.
   Also, I have java JDK 1.7.X & 1.6 installed on my machine</li>
<li>Ashraf Abu 2015-09-14

   I'm unable to get the errors you are facing.
   
   [~lchoudhary] My default properties is set to Java SE 7. Could you try setting that as default and see if it works? [^Screen Shot 2015-09-14 at 12.27.04 pm.png]
   
   Also, can you try going to the root of the project folder in Terminal then go the the path <code>/android</code> and run the command <code>ant clean</code> and then <code>ant</code>. If you are able to do this, then maybe perhaps it's a Studio issue. 
   
   Also, I have a <code>.bash_profile</code> that contains:-
   <code><pre>
   export ANDROID_SDK=~/Library/Android/sdk
   export ANDROID_NDK=~/Library/Android/android-ndk-r10e
   export PATH=$ANDROID_SDK/tools:$PATH
   export PATH=$ANDROID_SDK/platform-tools:$PATH
   </pre></code></li>

   @Hieu can you work with [~lokeshchdhry] today on this?</li>
<li>Lokesh Choudhary 2015-09-14

   [~msamah], 
   1. I changed the default java version to Java 7 & java 6 from studio as suggested by you & created new android module -- I still see the issue.
   2. Went to project root ,inside /android, ran ant clean, ran ant -- module built successfully.
   *NOTE - The module can be packaged successfully even though there are these annotations errors when the module is created. Studio just throws a pop up if you want to proceed packaging as there are errors* 
   3. My bash profile looks good.</li>
<li>Ingo Muschenetz 2015-09-14

   According to [~lokeshchdhry], this was user error. "My studio java complier complience level was at 1.4 setting it to 1.7 fixed the issue."</li>
<li>Lokesh Choudhary 2015-09-14

   Closing this issue.</li>
