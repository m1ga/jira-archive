<h3>Description</h3>

Quite frequently a build fails when I already have the app (including a Watch extension btw) running in Simulator. It hangs on the following:

<code><pre>
[TRACE] ** BUILD SUCCEEDED **
[INFO]  Finished building the application in 52s 589ms
[INFO]  Launching iOS Simulator
[TRACE] [ioslib] Found watchOS 2.0 app: com.appcelerator.sample.ti500.watchkitapp
[TRACE] [ioslib] Selected iOS Simulator: iPhone 6
[TRACE] [ioslib]   UDID    = 2845B3AA-D36C-41FE-80FF-31C7703488CC
[TRACE] [ioslib]   iOS     = 9.0
[TRACE] [ioslib] Selected WatchOS Simulator: Apple Watch - 42mm
[TRACE] [ioslib]   UDID    = 5371EA76-801C-4A2F-B835-4F548862A13A
[TRACE] [ioslib]   WatchOS = 2.0
[TRACE] [ioslib] Autoselected Xcode: 7.0
[TRACE] [ioslib] Removing old log file: /Users/fokkezb/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Devices/2845B3AA-D36C-41FE-80FF-31C7703488CC/data/Containers/Data/Application/85D2E2C3-541F-474E-B42A-7AA9FAF28C59/Documents/8bc52265-1ee8-45cc-9000-56b476b7196a.log
[TRACE] [ioslib] iOS and watchOS simulators already paired
[TRACE] [ioslib] Tailing iPhone 6 Simulator system log: /Users/fokkezb/Library/Logs/CoreSimulator/2845B3AA-D36C-41FE-80FF-31C7703488CC/system.log
[TRACE] [ioslib] Running: /Applications/Xcode-beta.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/simctl shutdown 2845B3AA-D36C-41FE-80FF-31C7703488CC
</pre></code>

The weird thing is that the Simulator(s) have long been closed by the time it runs the shutdown command.

When I abort it says:

<code><pre>
^C
TRACE  | signal handled SIGINT undefined

DEBUG  | signal received SIGINT sending to subprocess { domain: null,

etc...
</pre></code>

   I am not able to reproduce. I suspect this is either a glitch in the beta release of Xcode 7. Do you still see this happening with Xcode 7 GM?</li>

   Could not reproduce the issue. Tried build to iPhone Simulator with and without watch several times and it did build and launch app successfully.
   Mac OS 10.10.5
   Appc CLI NPM: 4.2.0-1
   Appc CLI Core: 5.0.0-51
   Titanium CLI: 5.0.1
   SDK: 5.0.0.v20150911123911
   Xcode: 7 GM</li>

   Closing ticket as the issue cannot be reproduced and due to the above comments.</li>
