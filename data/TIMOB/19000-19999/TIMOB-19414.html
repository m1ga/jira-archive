<h3>Description</h3>

Right now we have it include the headers for every wrapper type. But we could have it only include a minimal set. We already have the full dependency "graph" during generation of the native wrappers and this file, so we could potentially pare down the set of includes to be only the leaves of the dependency tree (i.e. If we include Windows.Ui.Xaml.Controls.TextBlock that will already include it's parent of Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.FrameworkElement and on up the chain, so we don't need to include those in WindowsNativeModuleLoader).

The same trimming could be used in the generated proxy wrapper cpp files as well.
