<h3>Description</h3>

While working on the [Ti 5.0 Sample App](<a href="https://github.com/appcelerator-developer-relations/appc-sample-ti500)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator-developer-relations/appc-sample-ti500)</a> I noticed that on the second and following builds the app is in letter box mode and the icon and launch image is missing (which triggers the letter box of course).

Probably related to the incremental builds.

   App icon and launch image are shown properly after few subsequent builds.
   Verified on: 
   Mac OS 10.10.4 
   Appc Studio: 5.0.0.201508271032 
   Ti SDK: 5.0.0.v20150831202903 
   Appc CLI NPM: 4.2.0-1 
   Appc CLI Core: 5.0.0-33
   Node.js: 0.10.37 
   Xcode 7b6</li>

   I'm seeing this with CLI 5.0.2 and SDK 5.0.0.v20150908200706 (Sept 9 CI). No app icon and letterboxed apps on iPhone5s.</li>

   [~timpoulsen] Try doing a clean, then build once to do the full build, then again for a subsequent build. This bug was fixed, so I'm surprised it's popping up again.</li>

   Cleaning seems to have taken care of it. Until I did the clean, I was definitely getting no icon/launch images after switching SDKs (<code>ti sdk select</code> and updating tiapp.xml). I guess anyone using Studio won't see this because it cleans automatically when you switch SDK versions.</li>

   The problem re-appears after a few builds. However, adding <code>--force-copy</code> as I noted on TIMOB-19283 creates a proper build with icons/launch images every time.</li>
