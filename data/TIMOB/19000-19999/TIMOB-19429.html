<h3>Description</h3>

There have been times when I was blocked because I could not modify the App Delegate in TiApp.h/TiApp.m in order to implement or augment delegate methods.

Most recently, I am blocked from handling iBeacon region status events when the app is not running. It seems to be possible for iOS to invoke a non-running app only if the CLLocationManagerDelegate is the AppDelegate.

   It would be awesome if this could be included in the next version of Titanium.

   +1 for this feature support! This is the only thing holding back titanium on having full iBeacon support.  </li>

   NOTE: This capability would still be very useful. I made a kludge to get iBeacon events when the app isn't running: <a href="https://github.com/jbeuckm/TiBeacons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/jbeuckm/TiBeacons</a></li>
