I'm trying to create a transparent view on top (in front) of the main view. 

I want the main view (at the back) to have 100% width and height. The second view is placed at the bottom 20% height an 100% width .

The second view is transparent with multiple circular button or images which i'll use as buttons.

Currently I can't get views to overlap (one on infront (top) and one at the back) they just get aligned next to each other (top, bottom, left or right).

I've attached an example with one button on the left

   Hello, Kgomotso Rantao
   
   Are you trying to do something like this?
   
   <code><pre>
   var win = Ti.UI.createWindow({
       fullscreen: true
   });
   
   var view1 = Titanium.UI.createView({
      backgroundColor:'white',
      width:Ti.UI.FILL,
      height:Ti.UI.FILL
   });
   
   win.add(view1);
   
   var view2 = Titanium.UI.createView({
      backgroundColor:'red',
      width:70,
      height:70,
      left: 50,
      bottom: 50,
      borderRadius: 35,
      viewShadowRadius : 4,
      viewShadowColor : 'gray'
   });
   
   view1.add(view2);
   
   win.open();
   
   </pre></code>
   
   Reply with your requirements. Thanks.

   The button on the bottom right doesn't move, it's  as if it's "floating" on top of the other view</li>

   Hi Amimul Hossain
   
   You have the same idea in mind but with a different result. I attached a video using a more common application.
   The Android gmail app and the floating button on the bottom right.
   
   I'll incorporate the code you added in the comment above to explain:
   
   View1 is vertically scrollable (Scrollview with vertical layout) like the example in the video. View2 two is part of the display but doesn't move with View1 scrolling movement. 
   So this simply means it's not added onto View1 (e.g view1.add(view2)) it's "floating" on top of View1 as it scrolls.
   
   Check the video example attached of the Android Gmail App. The button/view on the bottom right keeps it's position. </li>

   Hello, [~KRantao] Now i understand what you are asking for, Similar to Android floating action buttons. This has no  support for Appcelerator yet. Maybe you need to develop a module on this feature to support with Appcelerator. You can follow this community [link](<a href="https://community.appcelerator.com/topic/714/help-us-prioritize-the-new-features-to-be-implemented-in-the-appcelerator-titanium-sdk)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://community.appcelerator.com/topic/714/help-us-prioritize-the-new-features-to-be-implemented-in-the-appcelerator-titanium-sdk)</a> where people are talking about these features. Thanks.</li>

   To be considered for implementation via hyperloop</li>

   Hi guys, any plans do implement this feature?</li>

   I have implemented something using animation based on 'onTouchEnd' to get the new position dimensions. Seems to work OK on simulator, but not perfect. Yet to test it on a device.
   
   Would be something like below:
   
   //this function gets triggered upon onTouchEnd
   function btnTouchEnd(e) {
     //  console.log("x & y coordinates are " + e.x + " - " + e.y);
     var t1 = Ti.UI.create2DMatrix();
       t1 = t1.translate(e.x, e.y);
         var a1 = Ti.UI.createAnimation();
       a1.transform = t1;
      $.floatBtn.animate(a1);  //floatBtn is my view
   }
   </li>

   I have a Proof-of-Concept working with Hyperloop and will create a module for it this sprint. Basic requirements:
   * Size
   * Color (background & riffle)
   * Image
   * Actions
   * Show / Hide</li>

    Any news on this?</li>
<li>Hans Knöchel 2018-08-02

    There is an open source module available to support this functionality and all possible configuration. Please refer to [Ti.FAB](<a href="https://github.com/loop-modules/Ti.FAB)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/loop-modules/Ti.FAB)</a> for details and examples. Since this is an Android-only API, it should be hooked into the project if needed, but will not be shipped with the cross-platform core that focusses on native parity across the platforms.</li>
