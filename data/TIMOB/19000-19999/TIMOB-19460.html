<h3>Description</h3>

The documentation states that the following payload will trigger the silent push notificaiton:

{"alert":"","content-available":1}

how ever I have positively verified that this string does NOT trigger the notification, the string below does however trigger the silent notification according to the rest of the docs here. 

{"aps":{"content-available":1}}

Please change, lots of people might be confused...

did not do any deep analyses, just concluded by testing on device iOS 8.4 with SDK 4.1.0

Let me know if you need help (possibly the string might work in Arrow but then again this is not always the case...

   [~buder]: Can you provide a link to the docs where it is stated wrong?</li>

   Hello  thank you for providing the example! The documentation just covers the json structor part, which is needed for the silent push notification. As you said, it might be confusing at first, but our hope was, that it is clear because the json structure always needs to contain the root node which in this case is  {"aps": {} } If that is still unclear, we would update the docs, although we hope it is clear.</li>

   Hi
   
   As a certified trainer of Titanium for years I know that people that start using titanium either comes from one or the other side of app dev, for instance a Android dev knows little of iOS and do not know about root node, sure he can rad about it but what your documentation does not is that he will try item use the part of the string you have (as I did) and end up hating Titanium because "nothing works" or "All the docs are wrong", letas try to avoid this by improving the docs so that new people get the best experience starting with Appcelerator. If possible do include something like:
   
   For iOS the root node needs to be included in the payload and so the resulting payload will be: and then the full JSON object.
   
   Just a suggestion but really helpful for most people starting with Appcelerator
   
   thanks</li>

   There is a bug on Arrow DB side, and we will fix it via Arrow DB JIRA ticket CLOUDSRV-4740.</li>

   [~buder] I'm resolving this ticket as a duplicate of the (fixed) CLOUDSRV-4740, I hope it's working fine again! Let us know if you still experience problems in this direction.</li>
