<h3>Description</h3>

Facebook is now complaining about iOS 9 support and asking for updating the FB SDK along with some changes on the iOS Info.plist file.


I'm worried on how this can affect our iOS apps once iOS 9 final is released.


On Facebook Developer Console, a warning says:

Apple's iOS 9 introduces many changes that will affect the Facebook integration of your app “PiniOn”. You will need to make changes to preserve app functionality and ensure the best possible experience for people who use your iOS 9 app. Read this blog post for more information.

Action items you will need to take:

Download the new SDK for iOS 4.6 or v3.24.
The iOS 9 rollout introduces a new feature called App Transport Security which will require you to whitelist Facebook domains in your app's plist.
Update your app's plist to handle the changes to canOpenURL described here, so that your app can open dialogs in the Facebook app (for Login, share, invite friends, or native Likes).
Submit the new version of your app to Apple's app store.
Please refer to this guide and changelog for more information.

Should Titanium developers worry about this? Is a Facebook SDK update planned for iOS 9? Should we change our tiapp.xml manually in order to reflect those changes like Facebook servers/network requests whitelisting?

   It worth noticing that I have a running iOS 9.1 Beta (13B5110e) device with my app compiled on Ti SDK 4.1.1.v20150816214206 and it works OK, at least for Facebook Login.
   
   Just worried about this FB Alert and Dev post and how it can affect Ti apps.</li>
