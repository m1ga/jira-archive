<h3>Description</h3>


For the new iPad Pro there is a new icon 167x167 which is bigger than the current tablet 152x152 icon. We would like to have this support added to the TiSDK so that we provide the 167x167 icon and it then does the rest of the icon generation like it does for the 152x152 icon now on tablet builds. Also there needs to be support for the new iPad Pro splash screens for the resolutions:

   Other than tooling, iOS method that will be affected by this when new splash screen support comes in is:
   <code><pre>
   - (UIImage*)defaultImageForOrientation:(UIDeviceOrientation) orientation resultingOrientation:(UIDeviceOrientation *)imageOrientation idiom:(UIUserInterfaceIdiom*) imageIdiom
   </pre></code>
   </li>

   Can we prepare our apps by adding an Default-Landscape@3x.png and Default-Portrait@3x.png with the demanded resolution?</li>
<li>Chee Kiat Ng 2015-09-23

   Yes you can.</li>

   Bumping this ticket to 5.2 since at this time Xcode 7.1 beta 2 has no mention of iPad Pro app icons and launch images. We don't know what the width, height, or scale should be in the asset catalog.
   
   We know app icons are 167 x 167, but the scale is 2, so does that mean the width and height should be 83.5?</li>
<li>Rick Blalock 2015-10-06

   [~cbarber] - is it in beta 3?  It's all in Apple's HIG docs: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/IconMatrix.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/IconMatrix.html</a> .
   
   The width / height are always the base.  </li>
<li>Chris Barber 2015-10-06

   [~rblalock] Nope. It's been the docs for a while now (link is already in the description).
   
   I don't think the width/height are always the base. The 180x180 icon for iPhone 6/6s Plus is actually 60x60@3x. The 120x120 icon for iPhone 6/6s & iPhone 5 is 60x60@2x.
   
   With that logic, we can assume the iPad Pro's 167x167 at 2x scale is actually 83.5x83.5@2x, but that doesn't make sense. Instead of guessing, we will have to wait until Xcode tells us what we should do.</li>
<li>Rick Blalock 2015-10-06

   I meant what is listed in HIG is the base.  There isn't going to be a @1x size for that icon.</li>

   I tested with Xcode 7.2 beta 1 and there's still no info on the iPad Pro icon requirements.</li>

    TiSDK PR: <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/7424" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/7424</a>
    
    This PR introduces support for a new app icon: <code>appicon-83.5@2x.png</code>. This image must be 167x167 pixels.
    
    It is considered an optional app icon. If this app icon is missing, it will be auto generated from the <code>DefaultIcon.png</code>. If there isn't a <code>DefaultIcon.png</code>, the build will continue to succeed and iOS will fallback to the <code>appicon-76@2x.png</code> icon.
    
    As of right now, there is no image-based iPad Pro specific launch image. iOS uses the <code>Default-Portrait@2x.png</code> and <code>Default-Landscape@2x.png</code> images. On a side note, TIMOB-19694 introduces support for storyboard launch screens which means that by default when building using Xcode 7 or newer the image-based launch screens aren't even used (though they are present in the app).</li>

    83.5 is just crazy :D</li>
<li>Chee Kiat Ng 2015-11-13

    CR and FT passed. PR merged!</li>
<li>Rick Blalock 2015-11-17

    [~cbarber] - quick question:  We already have images for Default-Portrait@2x.png ,  iPad Pro can use those same assets?</li>
<li>Chris Barber 2015-11-17

    [~rblalock] Yes. There are no iPad Pro specific launch screens. It simply takes the retina iPad launch screens and scales them up. I believe this is because they are moving away from image-based launch screens and towards storyboard launch screens.</li>

    Rick, Chris, and Chee I checked out the change set here and I was wondering how the new iPad Pro Splash Screens were being handled. If you look at the Apple doc <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/IconMatrix.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/IconMatrix.html</a>
    
    The iPad Pro uses splash screens of sizes: 
    * 2048 x 2732 (portrait)
    * 2732 x 2048 (landscape) 
    
    These are new sizes which have not been used in the past and are needed so that apps on the iPad Pro do not run in compatibility mode where everything is scaled up. In our testing on the iPad Pro with existing images everything is bigger than expected just like when you run an iPhone build with only a iPhone 5 supported splash screen on an iPhone 6+. It just runs as an iPhone 5 and scales up. With the current image size it runs as an iPad and then scales that up to the Pro size. We would like to put the proper image in so it does not run in this compatibility mode.  
    
    Currently the iPads biggest splash screen is: 
    * 1536 x 2048 (portrait)
    * 2048 x 1536 (landscape) 
    
    That is not close to the new iPad Pro splash screen and the new iPad Pro screen needs to be used so its moved out of compatibility mode. I just read the comment about reusing the existing images. The only way it can use the existing assets from what I can tell is if they are at the sizes of the iPad pro so 2048 x 2732. 
    
    Can your team please look into validating on a device that a splash screen of size 2048 x 2732 will work with the new changes. Right now the only way I see it working is if I replace the Default-Portrait@2x.png image using the dimension 2048 x 2732 and then on older iPads that image is scaled down. 
    
    Thanks!</li>

    I looked into this more and I really don't understand how this solution meets the requirement from Apple that we have the following iPad Assets: 
    ||required icons||iPad & iPad mini (@2x)||iPad 2 and iPad mini (@1x)||iPad Pro (@2x)||
    |app icon|152x152|76x76|176x167|
    |splash screens| 1536 x 2048 (portrait) 2048 x 1536 (landscape)| 768 x 1024 (portrait) 1024 x 768 (landscape)| 2048 x 2732 (portrait) 2732 x 2048 (landscape)|
    
    According to the Apple Doc as cited in the description all of those image assets are *required.* See: [Icon and Image Sizes](<a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/IconMatrix.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006556-CH27-SW1)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/IconMatrix.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006556-CH27-SW1)</a>
    
    How do we meet this requirement? 
    
    From my reading of it we need to have at least 6 splash screens for the iPad support so I cannot use the iPad Pro splash screen for the iPad mini asset as suggested using the current name of Default-DIRECTION@2x.png. Is there some other Apple doc that says only 4 splash screens are needed for full iPad device support including the Pro? 
    
    Thanks for the assistance. 
    
    Does moving to the asset catalog approach allow all 6 images to be added? </li>
<li>Chris Barber 2016-01-06

    [~tcrist] It looks like Apple added the launch screen specs after this ticket was worked on. We currently do not support the 2048x2732 (portrait) and 2732x2048 (landscape) launch screens. In my testing, the iPad Pro would just use the iPad retina launch screens (1536x2048).
    
    I've created a ticket (TIMOB-20203) to add support, but as of Xcode 7.2, we don't know what dimensions and scale iOS expects in the asset catalog. We'll have to wait for the next version of Xcode to find out.</li>
<li>Sebastian Klaus 2016-01-06

    But how can native developer support iPad pro, if the dimensions are not specified?</li>
<li>Chris Barber 2016-01-06

    [~benutzername] I don't know. Can they?</li>
<li>Sebastian Klaus 2016-01-06

    Said nothing... Found no definitive specs too</li>
<li>Travis Crist 2016-01-06

    Thanks for writing up that new TIMOB Chris. I agree that is seems we need to wait for the next Xcode version to find out. </li>
<li>Rick Blalock 2016-01-08

    Do we know, at least, how to keep an iPad app from scaling up to the iPad Pro resolution?  Because reports are coming in that they look blurry.  I remember this happening before with the iPhone 6 where if you didn't have the appropriate splash screen image, it would scale up apps, and make them look blurry.  Is that how it works with the iPad Pro too?
    
    Also, I haven't tried hardcoding the images in the plist yet.  [~cbarber] Are we doing that at some point?  <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32875678/ipad-pro-launch-image-and-app-icon/33752847#33752847" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32875678/ipad-pro-launch-image-and-app-icon/33752847#33752847</a>
    
    </li>
<li>Chris Barber 2016-01-08

    [~rblalock] I suppose the only way to prevent the stretch is if there is support for full resolution launch screens. Or you could just use a storyboard launch screen.
    
    In any case, we don't know how a iPad Pro launch screen is defined in the asset catalog, but based on the SO link it appears it should be listed in the asset catalog as 1366 x 1024 @ 2x scale. This will need to be tested.
    
    I don't think we're going to support launch screens via the Info.plist going forward. It seems that Apple is moving away from it, however Info.plist is still the only way to support internationalized launch screens.</li>
<li>Rick Blalock 2016-01-13

    We have a chance to test the launch screen image support yet?</li>
