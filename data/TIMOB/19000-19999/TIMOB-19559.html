<h3>Description</h3>

I have little information about this but have seen this reported. Here is the latest report:

After installed Android SDK Tools 24.3, Android SDK Platform and Build tolls 23.0.1, SDK Platform API 21 and Google API 21, I received the error message in object when i set Android SDK Home in Preference. I try all the possible solution reinstalling all and also the operation system (now in Window 8) that I've found on the web and also on thi community but nothing works. I'm really frustrated and decide to left the idea of develop a mobile application with Appcelerator.
Do you have some idea?

   Closing issue as “Cannot Reproduce”. We have installed multiple versions of the Android SDK. since this issue was created, and have not encountered this issue. This issue is also extremely out of date with our current release (8.2.0.GA as of the date of closure), out of date with Windows OS, mobile OS versions, and out of date with Appcelerator Studio. 
   
   If community members feel that the issue is still valid, please add a comment, include code, and detailed instructions that demonstrates/reproduces the issue.
