   [~fokkezb] - I need to build one to see how it works but it looks like Apple wants you to build a lot of the view interface with TVML.  It also will allow you to change layouts and such on the fly.  </li>

   I started on one but scrapped it because it's just not a priority in our minds right now.  If there is room to do a MVP, then I can create one and we can talk about it.
   
   [~sdavenport] thoughts?</li>

   If we could get it running with just the UI components that work on both iOS and tvOS then people at least could start playing with it and maybe use hyperloop even to use other UI/system APIs until we have proxied them?</li>

   I think it would be worth having a quick Project Kickoff call to determine what we feel can be done from an MVP perspective to get to a place like Fokke mentions in Labs.  We will need to determine priority with other items in the queue for the SDK team.

   I think we should go for UIKit first, but this is a nixe example of TVML:

   The changes to support tvOS like we support share extensions and watchkit are not too hard to realize. I just tested it in the KitchenSink and <code>project.pbxproj</code>. We *could* tackle this for 5.4.0.</li>

   It's not our priority at the moment. There's a lot on the plate for 5.4.0 and 6.0.0, so unless there's strong demand from the community or clients, I don't see any likelihood of putting resources on this.</li>

   I have a request to port an app that I am working on to tvOS. I'm going to have the iOS version demoable by next month for NAB. They are happy with what I have done with Appcelerator so far.</li>
<li>Hans Knöchel 2017-01-31

   I just checked some more details on this. And it looks like the tvOS extension natively behaves the same as the watchOS one does, even more simple. If we place the tvOS target in /extensions and link it properly, it could technically work. </li>

    +1 on this extension. Could open new doors to existing AppC developers to target a whole range of experiences for the AppleTV.
    
    There really aren’t that many Apps for the TV, hence opportunity for Appcelerator Devs.</li>
<li>Hans Knöchel 2019-05-29

    We have the tvOS actually working. Linking the target is just like for any other target. The online thing not possible so far is running it on Simulator from the CLI  / Studio, which is FINE, since you usually develop and debug from Xcode anyway. To do so, just open the copied tvOS target in <project>/extensions/<tvos-project> and select the tvOS simulator like before. Signing etc can be done like for other extensions as well. If someone really needs this, please contact us and we can provide a PoC for your project.</li>
