		"description": "As a developer, I want to use the same application lifecycle handlers, regardless of which platform I'm deploying to.\r\n\r\nOn iOS the application is notified about its lifecycle via \"pause\", \"resume\" and \"resumed\" events from Ti.App.\r\nOn Android, one has to to assign handlers to \"$.win.activity\" or (slightly differently) \"Ti.Android.currentActivity\".\r\n\r\nSince the iOS functionality doesn't have any indication that it's iOS-specific, It would make for much clearer code if Android used the same mechanism.\r\n\r\nThis would probably be a breaking change but adaptation should be straightforward for any app that already supports iOS.",
