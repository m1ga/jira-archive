<h3>Description</h3>

I have a very strange problem related to ListView. I have created custom tab navigation system and dynamically add page view when tab is selected inside main container. The problem is that when that page contains a ListView it sometimes doesn't appear if I restart my app and open that tab again. This happens on average once in every 5-6 try.

I'm attaching the source I'm having the problem with. There are many unnecessary code which you can simply ignore. Try selecting the second tab below. Than quit the app (don't simply close) and re-open it and try to select the tab again. Repeat this process several time and you'll the that sometimes the ListView doesn't appear at all.

The listview is inside places_list.xml which is included from search.xml.

If you remove the <Templates> node completely than it should work fine.

   I'm not 100% sure that this is caused by Templates tag, but after several hours of investigation this was the only thing that fixed the problem...</li>
