<h3>Description</h3>

Sometimes would be really useful to know if there is an event attached to an object.

For example, let's say we want to attach  *Ti.App.addEventListener('app:whatever', myfunction)* but, to avoid double attach, we want to check previously if it is not attached yet.

Something like  *Ti.App.hasListener('app:whatever')* would be really useful to do a check before attach.

P.d.- I know *Ti.App.add...* is not recommended, but sometimes is better than other possibilities.

   Would love to see this implemented. Currently the only way to prevent double binding, is try and remove it first...</li>

   If double binding if fixed with this solution, of course could be a valid solution (I suppose the fix would be for iOS/Android/WP and for all listeners).
   
   Cannot imagine right now any case in that a user could need a double binding for the same listener. But if that case exists, then a check function would be the real solution.</li>
