   [~gmathews] I thought Windows 10 mobile is too early to target. [~cwilliams] thoughts?
   
   I think we need to target at least:
   
   * Windows Phone 8.1 VS 2013 <code>--wp-sdk 8.1 --vs-target 12.0 --target wp-emulator/device</code>
   * Windows Phone 8.1 VS 2015 <code>--wp-sdk 8.1 --vs-target 14.0 --target wp-emulator/device</code>
   * Windows Store VS 2013 <code>--vs-target 12.0 --target ws-local</code>
   * Windows Store VS 2015 <code>--vs-target 14.0 --target ws-local</code>
   </li>

   Ok, this has taken me a while to put together. This shows what currently works for Windows 10 and what doesn't.
   
   *NG Example*
   <code><pre>
   Compiling for Windows 8.1 - MSVC 12 - WindowsPhone - Win32
   Success - Runs on Windows Phone 8.1 Emulator and Windows Phone 10 Emulator
   
   Compiling for Windows 8.1 - MSVC 12 - WindowsStore - Win32
   Success - Runs on Windows 10
   
   Compiling for Windows 8.1 - MSVC 12 - WindowsPhone - ARM
   Compiles successfuly but fails to deploy to a Windows Phone 10 device
   
   Compiling for Windows 8.1 - MSVC 12 - WindowsStore - ARM
   Compiles successfully, can't test since I don't have a Windows ARM device
   
   Compiling for Windows 8.1 - MSVC 14 - WindowsPhone - Win32
   Success - Runs on Windows Phone 8.1 Emulator and Windows Phone 10 Emulator
   NOTE: Toolchain says v120_wp81 and NOT v140
   
   Compiling for Windows 8.1 - MSVC 14 - WindowsStore - Win32
   NOTE: Updates C++ Library and Compilers, but toolchain still reports v120 (for NG project) - <a href="http://puu.sh/kTKq9/97848b7a3c.png" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://puu.sh/kTKq9/97848b7a3c.png</a>
   Success - Runs on Windows 10

   Compiling for Windows 8.1 - MSVC 14 - WindowsStore - ARM
   Compiles successfully, can't test since I don't have a Windows ARM device
   
   Compiling for Windows 10.0 - MSVC 14 - WindowsPhone - Win32
   Failed - CMake Error: Visual Studio 14 2015 supports Windows Phone '8.0' and '8.1', but not '10.0'. Check CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION.

   NOTE: I'm using Windows 10. Visual Studio 2015 was used for ALL 'MSVC 14' projects.
   </pre></code>
   
   I decided not to test the other examples just yet since the errors will be the same for the same configuration.
   
   Looking at the errors it seems CMake doesn't support Windows Phone 10 for ARM yet, which is fine since we aren't targeting it. We also need to compile JavaScriptCore using MSVC 14 to target Windows 10.0. Although MSVC 12 and Windows 8.1 Store apps work fine on Windows 10.
   
   I also decided to test if Windows 8.1 apps will run on a Windows Phone 10 device. They "do" if they are already on the device OR downloaded from the Windows Store. But I can't deploy any Windows 8.1 apps to the device, I receive an error. I have tried deploying from VS 2013, VS 2015 and [WinAppDeployCmd.exe](<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/mt203806.aspx)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/mt203806.aspx)</a> that is provided with the Windows 10 SDK.</li>
