   This was done for good reason. wp-publisher-guid was an arg that carried over from Win 8 hybrid work so I didn't want to overload it to mean something different for Win 8.1 - especially since there's a specific use case for retaining the old value. The use case is if you have a Win 8.1 app that is supposed to be the new upgraded version of a win 8 app. You need to specify your old app guid (wp-product-id) and publisher guid (wp-publisher-guid) to migrate the app over. They use a new guid for Win 8.1 apps (win-publisher-id), so we introduced a new argument for specifying it, for Win 8.1 apps. So the new id is required, while the old pair are optional to migrate a Win8 app to 8.1 in the store.
   
   I updated the Github guide. Not sure where the right place in the docs/wiki are to update. the page you point to is marked "Deprecated". Any ideas [~bhatfield]?</li>

   BTW, this ticket should be marked as invalid unless we want to morph it into a docs ticket to make sure we replace -G/--wp-publisher-guid with -I/--win-publisher-id in our CLI examples for Windows 8.1</li>
