<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Issue Description</h4>

iOS simulator is not started on build and run

<h4>Issue Description</h4>

1. Open Appcelerator Studio 
2. Choose "Run" configuration on "iPad 2 (v8.4)" simulator 
3. Press play button (normally this builds and then launches the simulator) 
4. Wait for application to finish building and launch the simulator 
5. Note that the build completes but the simulator does not launch 

**appc info and logs are attached

<h4>* Additional notes</h4>
- The simulator also will not start if appc studio is closed and reopened, even if the stop button not pressed. 
-If the stop button is not pressed on the console this issue does not occur
-A way to run on the simulator is to open up the run configurations dialogue and run from there.
-Restart the system and run works too.
