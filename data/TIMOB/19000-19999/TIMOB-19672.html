   Hi,
   
   I started getting this error on all my apps this morning after installing the latest Studio updates.
   
   My problem was solved by fixing the run configurations. I had to select the correct provisioning profile, because the run configurations all seem to be referencing the wrong profile.
   
   Hope this helps.</li>
<li>Jeff Messick 2015-09-26

   Thanks for the advice.  I only have 2 provisioning profiles in the run config.  I have referenced the correct one.  Doesn't matter what I do in the run config, I get the same error.
   
   ON a side note I got the app to install 1 time out of about 25 tries.  </li>
<li>Jeff Messick 2015-09-28

   Here is the console log output.

   I'm facing the same issue. 
   Only way i've found to solve it was to restart my computer + clean the project and build it again.
   Appcelerator Studio 4.3.0.201509151348, Titanium SDK 5.0.1.GA. I am building for iOS 9.0.1.
   
   When building with CLI with the following command:
   appc ti build -p ios -I 9.0 -T device —liveview
   
   The application is successfully installed but when opening it is not being able to find the Live View Server.</li>
<li>levani 2015-09-29

   Same problem here...
   
   I use the following command to install my app on device:
   
   titanium build --platform ios --target device --log-level debug --deploy-type development --sdk 5.0.0.GA --pp-uuid 323ad4fe-92a2-4e8e-6535-6d5e75464253 --developer-name 'LM (NBHX4UGABM)'
   
   and getting the following error:
   
   [INFO]  Finished building the application in 38s 290ms
   [INFO]  Installing app on device: LM’s iPhone
   [ERROR] An error occurred during build after 49s 645ms
   [ERROR] Failed to copy app to device (0xe8000005)
   [ERROR] For some reason the app failed to install on the device. Try reconnecting your device and check your provisioning profile and entitlements.</li>
<li>Fokke Zandbergen 2015-10-01

   [~pinnamuri] On the Q&A, [~jmessick] has provided valuable information from the device logs:
   
   <code><pre>
   &lt;Warning&gt;: -[StreamingUnzipper _supplyBytes:length:withReply:]:1343: Invalid symlink: /private/var/mobile/Media/PublicStaging/APPNAME.app/app.js -&gt; /var/folders/l3/qfmj63l11n33fjr5m4nyxvj80000gn/T/liveview.js (absolute symlinks are forbidden)
   </pre></code>
   
   So it looks like we need to make sure that when we build the <code>liveview.js</code> is copied, not symlinked.
   
   [~cbarber] this is probably related to the revamped iOS build process right?</li>
<li>Chris Barber 2015-10-01

   [~fokkezb] Depends on where that error originated. I'm telling you now, it did not happen when running on an iOS 9 simulator.</li>
<li>Jeff Messick 2015-10-01

   Fokke - I was building to the device, iPhone 6 - 9.0.2</li>
<li>Fokke Zandbergen 2015-10-02

   [~cbarber] is seems like this is not LiveView only but a problem with symlinks we create that make the deploy to device break:
   
   <code><pre>

    [~fokkezb] You're getting these log messages directly from the device console logs? How can I reproduce this? </li>
<li>Fokke Zandbergen 2015-10-03

    [~cbarber] I personally can't.
    
    [~jmessick] [~levani] [~rdperottoni] please add your exact environment info (os, SDK, node etc) plus steps to reproduce so we can track and fix.</li>

    I had to reinstall 10.11 OS when it was released.  I installed a fresh copy of Studio, CLI , node, 5.0.1.GA  Imported my project. - Failed to connect. I got it to run 1 time, this morning and I got the error: [ERROR] : Script Error Couldn't find module: localeStrings for architecture: x86_64, not sure what is up with that. Was not able to get it to run again using live view. I can install it to the device NOT using Live View and everything is fine.
    Prior to I got the error's/issues even when I created a new project and ran it on the device with Live View enabled. See first Comments the I reported it.</li>

    I've installed the new version of studio from the website (latest .dmg file).
    After importing my projects to studio, if i try to deploy an app to an iPhone 5c with iOS 9.0.1 with LiveView on i get that error.
    If i try to deploy with <code><pre>appc ti build -p ios -I 9.0 -T device —liveview</pre></code> the app is successfully installed but i get infinite red screens of death telling me that the liveview server wasn't found.
    Simulators are ok, but i'm having to close the liveview servers manually when closing the simulators, otherwise they stay opened (i believe there's already a bug report for that, but that's another subject).

    Verifying as fixed, created a new default classic project and built to device with LiveView enabled. The error in question is no longer present and the app successfully builds to device, however upon launching the app receive the following error: 
    
    <code><pre>
    [ERROR] :  Script Error Couldn't find module: localeStrings for architecture: arm64
    </pre></code>
    
    Is this error expected? and is there already an existing ticket regarding this issue?

    [~htbryant] You should not get that error. Can you create a test case and send it to me?</li>
<li>Jeff Messick 2015-10-08

    Chris I am getting that error as well.</li>
<li>Harry Bryant 2015-10-08

    [~cbarber] My steps were as follows: 
    
    1. Created default classic project.
    2. 1st build to device (iOS 9) with LiveView enabled.
    3. launch app when installation is complete.
    4. Receive error.
    5. 2nd build to device with LiveView disabled.
    6. launch app when installation is complete.
    7. No error.</li>
<li>Chris Barber 2015-10-08

    [~htbryant] As your error states, the cause of the problem is the localeStrings CommonJS module. Classic Titanium apps do not have a dependency on this module. Again, please provide me with a test case and I will look at it.</li>
<li>Harry Bryant 2015-10-09

    [~cbarber] I've sent the test case in Flowdock, as it exceeds the upload limit on Jira. Let me know if you need any more information.</li>
<li>Chris Barber 2015-10-09

    [~htbryant] Yeah, the localeStrings error has nothing to do with this ticket. We'll take this discussion over to TISTUD-7747.</li>
<li>Harry Bryant 2015-10-09

    [~cbarber] Cool, I thought so. Just wanted to confirm it before closing this ticket, Thanks. </li>
