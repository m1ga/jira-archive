<h3>Description</h3>

<code>appc setup</code> always shows <code>Windows Store SDK is missing the deploy command</code> error message on Windows even when Windows Store SDK is installed.

It is because <code>deployCmd</code> variable is not actually used for Windows Store apps but <code>winstore.detect</code> always checks it and issues error message.

<code><pre>
$ appc setup
...
The following WINDOWS issues were found in your environment:

   *Closing ticket* as fixed, using the latest SDK build (5.1.0.v20151028061258) running "appc setup" returns no errors with Windows SDK installed. Also verified that the edits to winstore.js were present. 
   
   However it is worth noting that I could not reproduce the error with the affected build (5.0.2) after also verifying that the fix was not present in this build. 
   
   Windows 10 Pro
   Microsoft Visual Studio 2015
   Ti SDK: 5.1.0.v20151028061258 / 5.0.2.GA
   Appc NPM: 4.2.1-6
   Appc CLI: 5.0.2 / 5.0.4 / 5.1.0-38
