<h3>Description</h3>

When building a project for iOS (sim, device, or store) the process aborts while creating the icon set. A warning for an icon's alpha channel is shown, but no error or definie reason is given for the build to fail. See below console output:

<code><pre>
[INFO]  Creating app icon set
[DEBUG] Writing /Users/ewieber/THISTOO/build/iphone/Assets.xcassets/Contents.json
[DEBUG] Unsupported app icon Resources/iphone/appicon-60.png, skipping
[WARN]  Skipping Resources/iphone/appicon-60@2x.png because app icons must not have an alpha channel

  stdin: null,
  stdout: null,
  stderr: null,
  stdio: [ null, null, null ] }
</pre></code>

*Steps to reproduce issue*
1. Create a new native alloy project with <code>appc new</code>
2. Build that project with <code>appc run -p ios</code>

*Actual Results*
The above output is shown and the process quits during icon set creation

*Expected Results*
The build succeeds or a clear reason for a failure is given.

*Notes*
This could also be a bug. If builds fail when there is a 32-but image, then we should not include any in our default projects.

   [~cbarber] is this valid?
   I thought 
   <code><pre>
   [WARN]  Skipping Resources/iphone/appicon-60@2x.png because app icons must not have an alpha channel
   </pre></code>
    was reason enough :P</li>
<li>Chris Barber 2015-10-07

   Found a bug. It was throwing an error instead of returning. This causes the build to fail out instead of continue.
