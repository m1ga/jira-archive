<h3>Description</h3>

KitchenSink <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/KitchenSink" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/KitchenSink</a> *master branch* is a comprehensive test suite for UI-related components and views, but it's been outdated. We should fix certain things to make sure it works with the latest master branch:

1. Update DefaultIcon.png to make sure it's the right size and that it doesn't have alpha channel.
2. Enable auto layout, add the following tag to the ios tag in tiapp.xml
<use-autolayout>true</use-autolayout>
3. With auto layout enabled, fix all deprecated warnings (mostly to do with AUTO property)
4. Any differences in UI behavior for auto layout enabled vs disabled should have tickets filed under the same epic with detailed descriptions so that we can tackle them one by one.

   Thanks [~apetkov]! [~pec1985] when you can, please take a look at each of the above comments and let me know if i should create tickets for each to be addressed :)</li>
<li>Angel Petkov 2015-10-20

   [~apetkov] Sorry can you create a PR for master instead? and i believe that as long as your changes and fixes work without auto layout enabled, we can go ahead to review, merge and resolve this ticket. And i'll need you to create new tickets for each auto layout issue you commented. [~pec1985] will address those tickets instead.</li>

   PR pending for the master : <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/7475." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/7475.</a> Linked all the created tickets</li>

   [~apetkov] Hi, sorry if there was some misunderstanding here. I meant creating a PR for the KitchenSink repo Master Branch instead of the KitchenSink repo stable Branch.
   However, don't close the titanium_mobile.git PR yet. We might consider giving that an update.</li>
<li>Angel Petkov 2015-11-30

   Hi , sorry i should have read more carefully. PR for master : <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/KitchenSink/pull/84" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/KitchenSink/pull/84</a></li>
