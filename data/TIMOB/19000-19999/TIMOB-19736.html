<h3>Description</h3>

The <code>load</code> event of the <code>Ti.UI.ImageView</code> is not fired, when a remote image was already downloaded before (is cached).

*Use case*: 
This behavior produces critical problems when we want to show a preloader that we hide after an image is loaded. 

*Expected behavior*:
The <code>load</code> event is fired after the cached image is set.

*Actual behavior*:
The <code>load</code> event does not fire after the cached image is set.
