<h3>Description</h3>

Everything was working fine, then at approx 4.30 pm GMT, when I tried to test App on iPad mini, I got error Failed to install on device. I have tried another App (which previously was working), same error.  I created a new mobile App project (called Test), tried to deploy it to my device, same error.  I think I had just accepted updates for Appcelerator Studio and was wondering if this is the cause?
Error log output:[ERROR] :  Failed to install app on device (0xe8008018)
[ERROR] :  Project failed to build after 57s 167ms

   Hello, We are going to track this issue using your ticket. Since this has been witnessed by others, it doesn't seem specific to iPad. Please forgive the title edit, but I wanted to make sure the impact wasn't minimized by it being listed as a single form factor.
