<h3>Description</h3>

In the 3D Touch sample app we have to use a <code>setTimeout()</code> of ~500ms to delay the rendering of the list (and as part of that setting the previewContext on each thumbnail) after finishing selecting a picture from the device's Photo Gallery. If we don't than Peek and Pop will not work.

This happens only with Camera, Photo Gallery or another modal window. If non-modal window is open while we set previewContext it does work.

Sample code: <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator-developer-relations/appc-sample-3dtouch/blob/master/app/controllers/list.js#L81" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator-developer-relations/appc-sample-3dtouch/blob/master/app/controllers/list.js#L81</a>

   [~fokkezb] Does it only happen to those or also in other modal dialogs (e.g. <code>Ti.UI.iOS.NavigationWindow</code>). Because I think, the cleanest (and closest way to the native implementation) would be, to have close events on the camera and photo gallery dialogs (as well as contact picker as far as I think), since they all are <code>UIViewController</code>'s. 
   
   And when we have this ones, we place the code inside the close event, to make the sure transitions do not overlay. I think thats the quickest, but the cleanest solution here.</li>

   Or we could wait to call the callbacks until the UIViewControllers are closed.
   
   Yes, indeed the same is true when a regular modal window is open while the previewcontext is set. If it's a regular window it does work.</li>

   Just what i thought of, because the modal transition takes longer. So a) fire the "success" callback after the view controllers are closed or b) provide a "close" callback instead. No rush here, let's compare the pros and cons.</li>
