<h3>Description</h3>

Hello,

compiliing on a device with SDK 5.0.2 does not work. When the app starts, the app.js file is not found:

(Cocoa error 260.)" UserInfo=0x1700708c0 {NSFilePath=/private/var/mobile/Containers/Bundle/Application/854E8FE1-6B6F-409B-9B7E-CFE6083EF1A6/sandbox.app/app.js, NSUnderlyingError=0x17005c9e0 "The operation couldn’t be completed. No such file or directory"}
[ERROR] Script Error Could not find the file app.js

Steps to reproduce:

   I just have this problem when i compile for a device, the simulator it's ok, but i'm using the last version in this page <a href="http://builds.appcelerator.com.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html#master" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://builds.appcelerator.com.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html#master</a> but is not good to me, because i need up my app to Apple Store and to build the archive is need execute on device. I'm waiting for a solution....</li>

   As I understand from the linked community thread, are you trying to build in Xcode instead of the Titanium CLI? 
   If you wish to build the Titanium generated Xcode project in the build folder you need to:
   1. Xcode->Preferences->locations
   2. Derived Data -> Advanced -> Custom: Relative to Workspace
   3. Now build in Xcode it should not have that problem.
   Take note, if you do the above, do not Xcode Clean the project. 
   Also, it'll be good to switch back the settings when you are done with working on the Xcode project</li>

   No I'm not trying to build in Xcode but directly with the titanium CLI and the option -T device.</li>

   We are no longer able to reproduce the problem with latest RC candidate Studio and SDK builds. Can everyone having this problem try to install RC candidate builds, and verify ?
   
   Instructions to install RC builds :

   Is this resolved yet?  None of the solutions you guys post anywhere work.</li>
<li>Josh Lewis 2016-01-23

   The latest builds do not fix this.</li>

   Closing tickets that need more info from 2015 and earlier. Is this is in error, please reopen.</li>
