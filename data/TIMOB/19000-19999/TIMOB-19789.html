We might want to clarify <a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#</a>!/guide/Installing_the_Windows_Phone_SDK-section-43306274_InstallingtheWindowsPhoneSDK-VisualStudio which could be read as Visual Studio 2015 being "higher" then VS2013 Community as well.

Also, we might want to revisit installation docs about use with VS 2015 and Windows 10.

   I recently went through the setup of a Windows 10 + Visual Studio 2015 machine and here's what is needed in order to get the current 5.1.0 pre-relase stack working. Please note, I'm not mentioning the current things needed such as a Windows Publisher ID
   
   <h4>Visual Studio 2015 install requirements</h4>
   
   You will need to select _Custom_ install rather than _Typical_, see fig1
   Then you will need to select _Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.0/8.1 Tools_ in order to get the correct SDKs and emulators for Windows Phone, see fig2
   
   <h4>Windows 10 requirements</h4>
   
   The only thing I have noticed so far in that is *specific* to Windows 10 is that the in order to build a ws-local app you will need to enable Developer mode for your PC. This can be done by going to _Settings->Update & Security->For developers_
   
   To improve UX we should be able to detect this by running the command <code>Get-WindowsDeveloperLicense</code> in Powershell, if the setting is set to either _Don't user developer features_ or  _Sideload apps_ then it will throw the error 
   
   <code><pre>
   Get-WindowsDeveloperLicense : There is no developer license on this computer.
   At line:1 char:1
   + Get-WindowsDeveloperLicense
   + ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       + CategoryInfo          : InvalidOperation: (:) [Get-WindowsDeveloperLicense], InvalidOperationException
       + FullyQualifiedErrorId : NoRegisteredDeveloperLicense,Microsoft.Windows.DeveloperLicense.Commands.GetWindowsDevel
      operLicenseCommand
   </pre></code>
   
   However if _Developer mode_ is enabled then it will just return
   
   <code><pre>
   ExpirationTime      IsValid
   --------------      -------
   31/12/9999 23:59:59    True
   </pre></code>
   
   Here is a possible link we could use to explain developer mode and how to activate it <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/xaml/dn706236.aspx" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/xaml/dn706236.aspx</a>

   [~eharris] some questions to clarify:
   
   * By Windows Phone 8.0/8.1 do you mean you need both or one of?
   * Is selecting Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.0 and/or 8.1 also required if you only plan to build Windows 10 Universal apps?
   * Where is fig2?</li>

   FYI, I remember I used to install Windows Phone 8.0 SDK at the time when I install VS 2013, and then I installed Windows Phone 8.1 sdk from [here](<a href="https://dev.windows.com/en-us/develop/download-phone-sdk)." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://dev.windows.com/en-us/develop/download-phone-sdk).</a> 
   
   Latest document from Microsoft says 
   
   <a href="https://dev.windows.com/en-us/develop/download-phone-sdk" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://dev.windows.com/en-us/develop/download-phone-sdk</a>

   The Windows Phone 8.1 development tools are installed with Visual Studio Express 2013 for Windows with Update 2 or later.

   So I was expecting Windows Phone 8.1 SDK will be installed without installing WP "8.0" sdk when you install VS 2013. Or, you might just say "you need to install latest Windows Phone 8.1 sdk, you can grab it from [here](<a href="https://dev.windows.com/en-us/develop/download-phone-sdk)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://dev.windows.com/en-us/develop/download-phone-sdk)</a>"

   bq. Is selecting Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.0 and/or 8.1 also required if you only plan to build Windows 10 Universal apps? 
   
   That's a good point. I believe WP 8.0 SDK is not required. You only need to install WP 8.1 SDK. I haven't tested that situation, but I am expecting our <code>windowslib</code> doesn't work without Windows Phone 8.1 SDK, so Windows Phone 8.1 SDK is required even when you plan to build Windows 10 Universal app only.</li>

   [~fokkezb] apologies I had forgotten to upload the images. For your questions
   
   <code>By Windows Phone 8.0/8.1 do you mean you need both or one of?</code>
   
   I am simply referring to them by what Microsoft refers to them by in the Visual Studio installer, as you can see in fig2. They do not allow you to select just 8.1, you have to have 8.0 and 8.1.
   
   <code>Is selecting Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.0 and/or 8.1 also required if you only plan to build Windows 10 Universal apps?</code>
   
   I have not tested what happens here, I will run another install and check what happens without these two. Based off my current understanding though and echoing what [~kota] says, I believe that in order to build for a Windows Phone currently you will need the 8.1 SDK as we do not support 10. I am unsure about Windows Store (ws-local) builds however.</li>

   [~gmathews] Nice work! Could you confirm, does our <code>titanium_prep.win32.exe</code> and <code>titanium_prep.win64.exe</code> require Java environment and <code>JAVA_HOME</code> variable set? Otherwise I saw following error.

   [ERROR] Failed to encrypt JavaScript files
   [ERROR] Program launch failed. Unable to locate Java VM. Please set JAVA_HOME environment variable.
   2015-12-02T09:30:25.993Z | ERROR  | ti run exited with error code 1

   If so, I think we need to update the requirements. 
   
   Other than that, I think our docs looks good (y)</li>
