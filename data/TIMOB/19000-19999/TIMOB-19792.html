<h3>Description</h3>

In the node community, they've developed a project called NAN to abstract the v8 apis. The intention is to allow developers to pull in these headers and code against the latest V8 API but still be able to build/target older versions through adapter interfaces.

This may be useful for us if we want to shield ourselves a little from V8 API changes, but really would only give us the benefit of being able to target older V8 versions over time. We'd still need to update when we pull in new V8 versions.

It _may_ be useful as an abstraction for native module developers, though?

   NaN looks nice, but is geared for Node. It is useful as a reference for how the V8 Apis evolved over time though.</li>
