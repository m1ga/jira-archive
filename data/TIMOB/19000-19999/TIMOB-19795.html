<h3>Description</h3>

Once the V8 library is updated we'll need to do some significant work to update our native C++ code. There have been a number of large breaking API changes in V8 that we'll need to handle.

   I have this _mostly_ compiling on the v8-update branch now: <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/tree/v8-update" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/tree/v8-update</a>
   
   Right now it's failing at the end from what appears to be a "thin" ICU library issue. I believe the ICU static library was generated as "thin" (pointing at the built *.o files) and therefore we fail at the end due to missing references. I'll need to further tweak the V8_titanium build scripts to fix that.</li>

   This is now *working* on the v8-update branch (<a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/tree/v8-update)." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/tree/v8-update).</a> I have the standard two-tab classic Titanium app running fine on an Android emulator using V8 4.8.271.17, which is the latest stable version of V8 for Android (committed Jan 12, 2016). This brings us up to date from V8 3.9.24.29 (released way back on May 24th, 2012! Which means we have a version of V8 which is 3 years, 7 months and 20 days newer!)</li>
