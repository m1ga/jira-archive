<h3>Description</h3>

Low power mode is suppose to be a new feature introduced from iOS9, but one of customer keep get Push notifications deny due to Insufficient power budget on iOS8 device.

{quote}
Our app rely on silent push notifications to wake up and report location, however in iOS8 (at least) when the app has been left still for a few hours it enters a power budget state which obviously deny all incoming push notification. It appears as if when the app is opened and "reused" it starts receiving notifications again, however this is not a preferred behaviour.
