<h3>Description</h3>

Our current build for Windows SDK assumes we have a pre-built JSC installed on the machine and an environment variable pointing at it. This means that we have to VPN and RDP into the build agents to set up a new/different JSC build to use - grab the zip, unzip it, and then change the environment variable JavaScriptCore_HOME to point at the new folder. This means we can't try out new versions of JSC in a new build or PR.

We should change the build scripts (in groovy and/or the node scripts) to be able to point at a new JSC build URL to use for the build - so that we can make PRs that update JSC and see if the build/tests pass, and so that we eliminate the manual steps in setting up the build.
