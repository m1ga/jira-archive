					"body": "This sucked to try and track down. Looks like because I initially set the Windows boxes up as slaves using a service (so I no longer had to manually log in to connect them to Jenkins), it did this as Administrator by default. Great, except it f-ed up all the permissions and npm didn't like it one bit. So I tried some hacks, but eventually changed teh service to run as the same user I'd VPN/RDC in as. Awesome. Except now we magically can't find any emulators. Except using the exact same account manually, I can. Ran ProcMon while the build failed to pick up emulators. Shows access is denied to C:\\ProgramData\\WowSys64\\config\\AppData\\Local and various subfolders. WTF? Why would it be using those folders?\r\n\r\nBecause Jenkins has a big bug: \r\n- https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-27739\r\n- https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-28278\r\n\r\nbasically when the service connected to Jenkins master as Admin is cached all the ENV. Then when I later stopped/modified/restarted it using the correct account, IT NEVER UPDATED THE ENV VARS, thereby using the Admin HOME/USERPROFILE as the APPC/appcelerator user. Fix is to start service as APPC/appcelerator, restart Jenkins master and have a beer.",
