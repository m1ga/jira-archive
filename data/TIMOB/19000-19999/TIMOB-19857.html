<h3>Description</h3>

Node.js 0.10.0 was released in March 2013. 0.10.x hasn't been actively developed since April 2014. All releases since then have been security or critical fixes.

Node.js 0.12.0 was released Feb 2015 and hasn't been actively developed since July 2015.

While all of the code could be made to work with Node.js 0.10 and 0.12, there's a couple of reasons to drop support and immediately jump to Node.js 4.x or newer

1. We would reduce our test surface area
2. We would be using an actively supported Node.js version
3. We could start leveraging some of the Node.js 0.12 new features such as child_process.spawnExec() which would simply code.
4. We would be able to use some ES2015 features

To accomplish this, we need to:
* Update the "engines" section in each project's package.json
* Titanium CLI has a check that would need to be updated (<a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium/blob/master/lib/titanium.js#L31-L36)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium/blob/master/lib/titanium.js#L31-L36)</a>
* Titanium SDK's package.json "vendorDependencies" would need to be updated
* Studio would need to ship a more recent version of Node.js
