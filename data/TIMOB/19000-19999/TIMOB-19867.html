   Confirmed that Windows 10 Store Titanium app _works_ on Windows 10 mobile. Bad new is that their SDK tooling are different from previous version, they are using [WinAppDeploy](<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt203806.aspx)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt203806.aspx)</a> now which doesn't have a command to launch app nor list/access to emulators. In addition to that, Windows 10 version of Titanium libs should be built under Windows 10 + VS 2015 to support Windows 10 API. I expect those DLLs which is built for Windows 10 can not be used in Windows Store/Phone 8.1, so we need to ship DLL for both Windows 8.1 and Windows 10.
   
   So if we want to support Windows 10 mobile via Windows 10 Store app, we want to 
   
   * Build CI environment for Windows 10
   * Build Titanium libs under Windows 10 + VS 2015
   * Integrate those dll/winmd in Titanium SDK (which means you need both DLL for Windows 8.1 and DLL for WIndows 10)
   * CLI needs to be updated to support new tooling (expecially windowslib)
   * Still some of basic operation in tooling are missing (there's no launch command etc)
