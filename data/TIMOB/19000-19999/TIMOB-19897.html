<h3>Description</h3>

On Windows Phone 8.1, label's getRect method, which is supposed to return an object throws error: mainText. getRect() is not a function. (In 'mainText.getRect()', 'mainText.getRect' is undefined.
I use this method on Android successfully and I need it to calculate weight of a label.
Another method which is working on iOS is toImage method, but it's iOS only.
Please look at it.
Thank you

   Hi Kota,
   will this fix be included in tommorow's(11.11.2015) release? 
   Thanks</li>

   [~max87] Hi Marian, I'm afraid not. This fix is merged very recently and is not reviewed by QE, so I don't think we can include this tomorrow.</li>

   Thanks Kota, I'm looking forward to next release that fixes this and another windows phone bugs...</li>

   Hello Kota,
   may I ask you when will be next release available? I read that at 11.11 was planned  to release new version, but even today I haven't any updates available. I'm looking forward for this, because I develop multiplatform application and that release suppose to include many bug fixes for WP platform.
   Thank you.</li>

   For now it's scheduled to release at 5.2.0, but I don't know exactly when it will be released...I would suggest trying out our very latest "[Continuous Builds](<a href="http://builds.appcelerator.com.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html#master)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://builds.appcelerator.com.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html#master)</a>" version in case you need the update asap. (FYI [Installing Titanium SDK Continuous Builds](<a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#</a>!/guide/Installing_Titanium_SDK_Continuous_Builds-section-29004843_InstallingTitaniumSDKContinuousBuilds-ManualInstall)). I think it's useful to try CI version because Windows SDK is actively updated, for not only bug fixes but also new APIs.

   Hi Kota, 
   I tried to download latest 5.2.0 SDK as you adviced, but problem with getRect() persist.
   It throws new error: {color:red}Runtime error during postlayout event: invalid vector <T> subscript.{color}
   If I put that code outside postlayout event listener, it throws error:
   {color:red}Error while require (/app) invalid vector <T> subscript{color}
   Thanks</li>

   [~max87] Could you paste a sample code that reproduces this issue? I tried following but it runs without errors.
   
   <code><pre>
   var win = Ti.UI.createWindow();
   var view = Ti.UI.createLabel({ text: 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.' });
   
   win.addEventListener('postlayout', function () {
       Ti.API.info(JSON.stringify(view.getRect()));
   });
   
   win.add(view);
   win.open();
   </pre></code></li>

   Hello Kota,
   I'm sorry, getRect() is working fine, my error was caused by using Ti.API.log(old habit from iOS/Android) instead of Ti.API.info.
   Thank you very much for your time and for fix.</li>
<li>Kota Iguchi 2015-11-17
