<h3>Description</h3>

As part of their Material Design, Android has introduced the Snackbar. It is a new type of toast message that can display one or two short lines of text and a single button in a slide-up view displayed at the bottom of the screen.

I would like to implement this aspect of material design in my app. At this point, I'm stuck writing an Alloy widget that won't be able to implement native behavior, such as automatically pushing up the floating action button.

   To be considered for implementation via hyperloop</li>

   Moved our Hyperloop-Examples code of the Snackbar into an own Hyperloop module: <a href="https://github.com/hyperloop-modules/ti.snackbar" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/hyperloop-modules/ti.snackbar</a>
   
   Resolving as <code>Fixed</code>.</li>

   I think we should reconsider adding this to Titanium's core. It's easy to add, popular amongst native Android developers, and should support all Android OS versions via Google's "design" support library.
   
   It can be added as: <code>Ti.UI.Android.SnackBar</code>
   And it can work similar to an alert/option dialog, except it only supports 1 button.
   
   I suppose the closest equivalent on iOS is our OptionDialog with 1 button, but the dialog eats up much more vertical space compared to Android. An Android <code>SnackBar</code> is more like a toolbar with a message and a button which slides in.</li>
