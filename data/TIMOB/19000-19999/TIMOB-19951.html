   Unfortunately I was not able to make this work on Windows 10 Mobile as well as Desktop. I can see that <code>EmailManager::ShowComposeNewEmailAsync</code> is done without any exceptions and it actually fires <code>Completed</code> event, but nothing happens actually on the UI! I have no idea what's going on there :(</li>

   I have been struggling to make attachments work on Windows 10 including Mobile device, but I ended up finding that it has been a known issue that Microsoft confirms, which is known but not fixed for nearly 3 years.
