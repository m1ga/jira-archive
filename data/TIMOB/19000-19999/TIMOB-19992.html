<h3>Description</h3>

I have no idea if this is possible, but it would be nice if <code>--launch-watch-app</code> would always launch a paired Apple Watch, regardless of whether the app has an iOS extension containing a watch app. That way you could (hopefully) test (local) interactive notifications scheduled by the app since they should show on the Apple Watch if the iPhone is locked, even without a watch app.

Right now the CLI self-disables the flag without an extension:

<code><pre>
[WARN]  --launch-watch-app flag was set, however there are no iOS extensions containing a watch app.
[WARN]  Disabling launch watch app flag
</pre></code>
