<h3>Description</h3>

If we generate a native UI proxy (say an android.view.View) and add it to a Titanium UI, we don't properly clean up all the native proxies we've generated leading to a large memory leak. Specifically we need a way to track all UI proxies added as children in the view hierarchy and explicitly release them when the top-level native view is asked to release in our Java code (TiUIView.releaseAllViews())

   Thanks Chris! The changes are quite small, compared to their impact. It will take me some time to check several cases. Then [~cng] is our man to decide whether or not it can even get into 5.4.0 instead of 6.0.0. I guess fixing memory leaks cooould be fine, since it's no feature but a critical bugfix. But we can worry about when it's reviewed and merged. Thanks guys!</li>
