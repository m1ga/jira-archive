<h3>Description</h3>

When doing test of the hyperloop example app with Android hyperloop examples, I will run into the CLI intermittently not recognizing that the emulator was already open and ready. The build will stall at "waiting for emulator to be ready" and will eventually time out.

You simply need to kill the build and start a new one to workaround it (and maybe kill the emulator too for good karma), but it's a pain.
