   <div><p>System Buttons are only available in toolbars and nav bar
   left/right buttons (Not even title view) due to how the iOS does
   system buttons. Essentially, system buttons with the icons are not
   actual views, and as such, can not exist in any view beyond those
   locations. Long explanation below.</p>
   <p>Natively, the class that represents an entry into a toolbar or
   nav bar corners is called UIBarButtonItem. Its inheritance tree is
   UIBarButtonItem-&gt;UIBarItem-&gt;NSObject, not UIView. When we put
   a view into a toolbar, we're actually adding UIBarButtonItem which
   was initialized with initWithCustomView:, passing in the UIView the
   proxy represents. When we put a system button into a toolbar, we're
   adding a UIBarButtonItem which was initialized with
   initWithBarButtonSystemItem:target:action: , passing in the
   systemType integer, with no view representation.</p>
   <p>This, incidentally, is also why system buttons are so limited in
   properties; The properties UIBarButtonItem provides for system
   button style buttons are enabled, image, title, width, and style
   (only 3 options). No height, no color, no transparency, tint, no
   background image.</p></div></li>
