   <div><p>About how many views would you consider "a large amount"?</p></div></li>
<li>ctredway 2011-04-15

   <div><p>50+</p></div></li>

   <div><p>Appears to have been fixed by Blain's <a href=
   "/projects/32238/tickets/2003" title="Ticket #2003">#2003</a>, the
   image view memory panic issue. No doubt caused by the fact that a
   large number of images were being loaded locally.</p>
   <p>Note, the problem might persist for images which were cached
   from a remote source!</p></div></li>

   <div><p>Whoops, gonna mark this fixed-in-qa for Thom to test and see if
   it was fixed by <a href="/projects/32238/tickets/2003" title=
   "Ticket #2003">#2003</a>.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>With today nightly it is still crashing. In my sample I cache
   just 3 pictures and change them three by three.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>This bugfix is currently in our master branch. It is not folded
   into the nightly builds until the fix is approved, which should
   happen sometime this week. If you need the fix before then, you may
   develop off of our (potentially unstable) master branch: <a href=
   "<a href="http://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/tarball/master" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/tarball/master</a>"><a href="http://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/tarball/master" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/tarball/master</a></a></p></div></li>

   <div><p>tried with github - it crashes, but it took more time to
   crash.</p></div></li>
<li>Stephen Tramer 2011-04-15

   <div><p>We will be able to respond to this ticket faster if you post a
   crash log.</p></div></li>
<li>Marko Perutovic 2011-04-15

   <div><p>This is all I have in
   ~/Library/Logs/CrashReporter/MobileDevice/my_device. Is there else
   I should look?</p></div></li>
<li>Stephen Tramer 2011-04-15

    <div><p>That's the only place you should need to look to find crash
    logs. Unfortunately neither of these are very helpful; this is
    probably a memory panic issue.</p></div></li>
<li>Stephen Tramer 2011-04-15

    <div><p>As long as you are keeping your image views attached to a window
    and not explicitly deleting them, the images that they use will
    continue to take up memory. Using so many image views all at once
    without loading/unloading them on demand is going to cause memory
    problems. iOS will not unload these images from memory if they are
    still in use somewhere and this will lead to memory panics and
    crashes.</p>
    <p>Titanium does require better memory management, but there is
    nothing we can do about excessive use of memory which is related to
    views that are not cleaned up.</p>
    <p>Marking invalid.</p></div></li>
<li>Stephen Tramer 2011-04-15

    <div><p>Note that although this bug is marked invalid, better memory
    management for scrollable view may become a feature available in
    the future. Depends on whether or not we can support dynamic
    load/unload of contents of scrollable view frames. See bug <a href=
    "/projects/32238/tickets/2193" title="Ticket #2193">#2193</a>.</p></div></li>
