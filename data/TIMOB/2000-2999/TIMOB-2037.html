<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>Using continuous builds from both a month ago, and today's
latest, Ti.UI.createWindow({modal: true}) and window.open({modal:
true}) fail miserably and force close upon the window's activation.
Had to switch to navBarHidden instead until this is fixed.</p>
<p>Below is the log line that failed... it appears an Activity must
be setup now to open modals? Doesn't seem kosher.</p>

android.content.ActivityNotFoundException: Unable to find explicit
activity class
{com.evilwalrus.weddingapp/org.appcelerator.titanium.TiModalActivity};
have you declared this activity in your AndroidManifest.xml?</p>

   <div><p>Additionally, wierd factor here; Tested on two devices:</p>
   <p>Droid Milestone w/ CM6 - Works as it should.<br>
   LG Ally w 2.1-update1 - Fails in above case.</p>
   <p>I haven't had a chance to snoop the source tree today for a
   possible fault, but it almost seems as though something was updated
   with 2.2 API/8 specific code, rather than BC. I'll try and take a
   gander later today.</p></div></li>
