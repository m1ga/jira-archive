<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>1.BaseUI&gt;Views&gt;Image Views&gt;IMage View Encoding<br>
2.note appearance of image</p>
<p>results: image scales to screen size. New behavior (would be
much smaller), not sure if its intentional.</p></div>

   <div><p>This is another case where previous behavior may or may not be
   considered "correct." We have two options here:</p>
   <ul>
   <li>Resizing the underlying image view (the UIImageView, not the
   proxy view) to fit the image border when necessary</li>
   <li>Letting the image automatically scale to the size of the
   UIImageView as appropriate</li>
   </ul>
   <p>It seems to be that the first was previous behavior, and the
   second is new behavior. It comes down to whether or not we want
   images to scale to the view size specified by the user when they
   indicate no width/height, or if we want the view to scale to the
   image when they specify no width/height.</p></div></li>
<li>Blain Hamon 2011-04-15

   <div><p>I'm going to propose that the new functionality should be the
   expected behavior, as it allows a means to use the older behavior:
   If height and width were set to be 'auto', it should work. Were the
   old functionality restored, there would be no way short of using
   transforms to scale up images.</p>
   <p>If we do it this way, this would be invalid.</p></div></li>
