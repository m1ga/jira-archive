   <div><p>This is mostly a perception issue as to when "done" is. In the
   previous release it did some things partially and you saw something
   quicker, but it wasn't really done. Now to handle the
   create/start/resume event properly, we have to handle booting a js
   context and block on the main thread. All non-critical tasks should
   be moved into the <code>open</code> event so that the activity will
   load faster. There is no way for us to guess at what code can be
   delayed so the developer must do the work manually. In summary, do
   more stuff asynchronously via event, rather than all of it in the
   global scope.</p></div></li>
