   Network listener is attached the first time the event listener for the 'change' is added or when the application (root activity) is resumed.  
   
   In the KitchenSink example, the first time the test is opened the registration for the 'change' event causes the network listener to be initially attached and the first event to be fired.  If you back out of the test and then open it then you will not see a new 'change' event because the network listener is still attached and the network state has not changed.
   
   If you were to hit 'home' when inside the network test, turn on airplane mode and then come back into KitchenSink you would see that the network state has changed due to a new 'change' event that fired when the airplane mode was enabled or disabled.
