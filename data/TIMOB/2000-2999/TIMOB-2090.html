   <div><p>This and <a href="/projects/32238/tickets/2087" title=
   "Ticket #2087">#2087</a> are most likely bugs that relate from the
   iPhone idiom being presented on iPad and not scaling properly.
   Visual bugs between idioms should be expected under some
   circumstances, but we will take a look at this when there is
   time.</p></div></li>

   Resolving ticket as Invalid as there is now a new version of Kitchen Sink available and we no longer support the version which relates to this ticket.</li>
