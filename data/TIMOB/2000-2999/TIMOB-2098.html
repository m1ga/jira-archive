<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>These are present and working with 1.4.1 under iOS. Would be
really handy to have these under Android. Basically, I have to use
singletap instead of click on a table, as that table also handles
swipe and dblclick events (if I use click, it will get called
during these other events much of the time).</p>
<p>The docs would also need to be updated to list the new
properties to the event object.</p></div>

   <div><p>FYI: Row-level properties are also missing on the dblclick event
   on Android.</p></div></li>

   Appears to be a parity issue. Relabeling.</li>
