   <div><p>Must discuss plans for FB module with Jeff, Ti+ or Titanium</p></div></li>

   <div><p>Stephen could not reproduce, and on looking at the crash log
   again, the crash itself is in TiProxy, which has had changes.
   Marking as needs more info and will pow-wow with Thomas to see if
   we can reproduce. If not, suggesting we mark this as resolved.</p></div></li>
<li>Blain Hamon 2011-04-15

   <div><p>Thomas could not reproduce, and suggested we close this bug. As
   this was a bug deeper than Facebook and may have had symptoms
   elsewhere, it's entirely likely this was fixed without us knowing
   about it.</p></div></li>
