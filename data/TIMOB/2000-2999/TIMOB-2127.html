<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>It looks like sometimes contexts are not destroyed when popping
nav controllers, if the operation is performed fast enough. To
witness, run KS-&gt;Phone-&gt;Play Movie-&gt;Embedded Video and
immediately click the left nav button. May take a few times to
reproduce, but eventually you will get the video playing (you can
hear the sound) and no 'complete' message. When the video does stop
playing two 'complete' messages will appear.</p>
<p>Probably has something to do with our nav stack management.
Confirmed to not just be a problem with the video player, although
that's the most obvious way to see the issue.</p></div>
