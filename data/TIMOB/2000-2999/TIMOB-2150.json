					"body": "{html}<div><p>Hi. The priority on the ticket is set to Low on the ticket. Am\nfinding the httpclient in iOS for most part unusable and in a\ndeteriorating state. Not quite sure where to go with this as months\nare going by. I can send and receive json but in only the most\nbasic way and it is virtually useless for my apps since\nauthentication and transport are handicapped by issues that are\nstacking up (as long as seven months)</p>\n<p>Standard authentication schemes, setting request headers,\ngetting response headers and this passing credentials in url are\nbasic things you need to get done in a client lib. Despite setting\nup a decent generic method for handling http, it is not my code but\nthe client that is broken, regresses and remains this way. To\nsummarize the issues in iOS:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>you cannot set user and password due to this specific issue\n<a href=\"/projects/32238/tickets/2149\" title=\n\"Ticket #2149\">#2149</a> Oct</li>\n<li>problem with this in callbacks for XHR issue <a href=\n\"/projects/32238/tickets/519\" title=\"Ticket #519\">#519</a> since\nMar</li>\n<li>problems with header parsing and responseData in onerror\nhandler issue <a href=\"/projects/32238/tickets/1502\" title=\n\"Ticket #1502\">#1502</a> Aug and workaround no longer works on\ntrunk</li>\n<li>setRequestHeaders are broken again on nightly 1.5.0 that I\nobtained yesterday. This has been an ongoing regression <a href=\n\"/projects/32238/tickets/1983\" title=\"Ticket #1983\">#1983</a> and\nprior to that</li>\n<li>my JSON data is now generating parse errors from recent nightly\nbuild since and assuming response data is XML. And why wouldn't it\n- you are unable to set an Accept header or Content-Type header so\nthe client is no longer aware it is getting JSON. So the parser\nstill parses but emits an error. From all indications, this began\nshowing up approximately two weeks ago. Folks have been discussing\nin Q &amp; A but looks like they gave up.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A common thing to want to do with titianium is to interact with\na web service and has become increasingly frustrating since even\nbasic authentication cannot be accomplished without setting\nauthorization headers or passing credentials in a url, and JSON\ncannot be transported without errors in or in a secure way. I am\nsure you can get a sense that this is impossible to work with.</p>\n<p>Can you advise whether you employ any unit testing on your side\nto see such things before they are reported? This is second time\nround for discussing headers for me and there is no doubt others\nare not finding lighthouse to report the trouble. I believe this is\nat least a second or third regression setting request headers.</p>\n<p>If these things cannot be fixed, perhaps replacing with\nsomething better is a reasonable option. I have attached a link for\na reliable general purpose http and REST lib used in many\nsuccessful iPhone projects and which includes unit tests. Please\nforward this to someone on the iPhone team to examine for potential\nwrapping. If things do not improve, I will be looking to wrap some\nof this generic functionality.</p>\n<p><a href=\n\"http://allseeing-i.com/ASIHTTPRequest/\">http://allseeing-i.com/ASIHTTPRequest/</a></p></div>{html}",
