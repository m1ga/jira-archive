<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>1.5.0.70ce98 g2 running 2.2</p>
<p>1.Phone&gt;Photo gallery (my G2 has only about 18 images in
it)</p>
<p>results: takes 4 seconds for the text labels to appear, then
about 10 for the images in my library to load. This takes about a
second on the G1, so guessing its specific to the device</p></div>

   <div><p>Is this consistent? All we do is tell the phone to launch the
   gallery app. If it's the first launch in a while, it scans the
   device for all new images. The G1 running 1.6 doesn't do that, in
   fact apps were written to force a scan so the gallery would
   actually update.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>I should have looked deeper - I've seen the same slowness
   opening the gallery with no Ti involvement. Closing as invalid</p></div></li>
