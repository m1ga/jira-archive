<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>From a premium customer. Was able to view the issue in some of
their code, and can find no fault with what they're doing; filing
the bug so that I can track it.</p></div>

<h3>Comments</h3>

<ol>
<li>Stephen Tramer 2011-04-15

   <div><p>Looks like a race condition involving how custom events are
   used, in conjunction with open/close. Could be a need to force
   certain operations onto the UI thread. May or may not be
   solvable.</p></div></li>
<li>Stephen Tramer 2011-04-15

   <div><p>Caused by redecorating a window. Because of how decorations
   work, they may not be removed before the window is reopened; once
   it is, then the decorations are NOT automatically removed or
   destroyed (and, in fact, this might have to do with the same
   decorations being reused and having new values placed for
   them).</p>
   <p>Marking invalid.</p></div></li>

   Closed as invalid.</li>
