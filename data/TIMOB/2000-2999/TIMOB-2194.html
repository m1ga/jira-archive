<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>Contexts are not currently closed. This is because there were a
series of bugs involving contexts where closing a context
would:</p>
<ul>
<li>Invalidate certain windows which were opened from inside a
context which was then closed</li>
<li>Closing a context could interact unfavorably with certain types
of event listeners</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately I no longer have the specific bug #s for bugs
caused by context shutdown so that context cleanup can be
tested.</p>
<p>Context cleanup is an extremely important task and this should
be considered a <strong>CRITICAL BUG</strong>.</p>
<p>Assigning to Blain for bookkeeping.</p></div>

   <div><p>Claiming. This is related to a helpdesk issue involving memory
   management. Contexts have a death grip on all proxies and possibly
   their view contents.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>This is actually untrue right now, but may have re-introduced a
   large number of bugs. See commit f5887ae, which cleans up contexts
   when they are no longer required (by closing windows).</p>
   <p>Putting this one on the back burner. Instead what we're more
   interested in now is why contexts don't release objects that are
   clearly no longer in use. See brand new sister bug <a href=
   "/projects/32238/tickets/2207" title="Ticket #2207">#2207</a>.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>Swapping back to new/future since technically this bug is fixed.
   We just need more accurate context management.</p></div></li>
<li>Stephen Tramer 2011-04-15

   <div><p>Bumping to 'medium' priority, since we do currently release
   contexts. We just need to do it more intelligently.</p></div></li>

   Invalidated by the majority of memory management work that we've performed over the last several releases. Also supplanted by the concept of moving to single-context.</li>

   Closing ticket as invalid.</li>
