<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>Is it possible to build in runnable threads? Too many times I've
been running intensive XHR requests, and they lock up the UI
portion of the app. Would it be possible to implement such a
feature to allow the request to run in the background, whilst still
keeping the UI free?</p>
<p>I've thrown around some code today that isn't of any quality,
but with the Ti proxies and such, I don't think it would be hard to
implement a ThreadManager module (for namesake).</p>
<p>Andrew</p></div>
