<h3>Description</h3>

I couldn't find an existing ticket for this, but I remember it being mentioned somewhere before.

Would like to be able to draw vector shapes on top of a map with various colours / opacity / textures. Bonus points for code that assists with drawing and manipulating the vector with touch events, placing markers on the corners for resizing etc. Otherwise, at the very least some event triggering for clicking + interacting with the vector shape.

This adds a whole other dimension to mapping applications for plotting areas and recording information against these areas.

   We have a customer on HD asking also for this. He would like the possibility to use KLM files to define the coverage.

   Needs to be discussed as to whether or not it can fit into the 1.8.0 timeframe, or is even possible on iOS.  This would be a major new feature for us, requiring significant investment.</li>

   Estimate includes time for spec plan, spec writing, spec review, spec approval, and implementation. This would have to be a greatly accelerated process and could lead to a faulty API.
   
   Highly recommended we postpone past 1.8.0.</li>

   Saw the TIMOB-1343 being closed today, recommend for this ticket to be looked into as its a part of the same primary feature ie. maps. It would complete all map functionality available natively.</li>

   Hello,
   
   We got a request from another customer about this issue: the requirement is to be able to overlay a vector file (1 or more) over an Appcelerator MapView. They also want to be able to click on the Map to add new points.
