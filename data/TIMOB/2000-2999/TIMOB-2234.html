<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>Files which we open never have their vnodes cleaned up. Could be
an Apple bug. Only a problem when opening ~1250 vnodes; this seems
to be the iPhone's limit on the vnode table.</p></div>

<h3>Comments</h3>

   <div><p>Should've clarified; this may only affect Ti.UI.imageView.image,
   and other image caching.</p></div></li>
<li>Stephen Tramer 2011-04-15

   <div><p>Some research has indicated that the issue may actually be
   URL-&gt;file translations since these use lstat(). Opening images
   off the filesystem uses open/fstat/close, meaning that vnodes and
   file descriptors are probably freed up (and testing outside
   Titanium bears this out, as it does not appear to have vnode
   problems).</p>
   <p>However lstat alone does not account for the vnode issue. 273
   vnode entries are unaccounted for by the sample program (provided
   by helpdesk, see <a href="/projects/32238/tickets/2014" title=
   "Ticket #2014">#2014</a>). Must be missing something.</p></div></li>
<li>Stephen Tramer 2011-04-15

   <div><p>Bumping to medium priority. This only affects opening 900+
   files. The original HD ticket which brought this bug to my
   attention has switched to a non-local strategy, lowering the
   urgency of solving this bug.</p></div></li>
<li>Stephen Tramer 2011-04-15

   <div><p>System resource problem that's potentially related to either (a)
   memory or (b) iOS or even (c) both. Complex to solve and probably
   for 1.6.0.</p></div></li>
<li>Lee Morris 2017-06-05

   Closing ticket due to the time passed and lack of progress over the past few years.</li>
