<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>Don Thorpe mentioned that it would not be too difficult to port
to iOS the code for 9-patch that has already been implemented in
the Android branch.</p>
<p>For some background reading, see <a href=
"<a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/graphics/2d-graphics.html#nine-patch" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/graphics/2d-graphics.html#nine-patch</a>">
9-patch info</a> and <a href=
"<a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/tools/draw9patch.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/tools/draw9patch.html</a>">
draw9patch tool</a>.</p>
<p>This would obviously make designing layouts for both platforms
so much simpler.</p></div>

   <div><p>Ok, I have talked with our engineers.</p>
   <p>I will accept the triage responsibility.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>Ralf - what a response!</p>
   <p>You will see from my previous tickets that they are (almost)
   always valid (or else I rectify them quickly), clearly described,
   are often validated (and authorised) by speaking directly to a dev
   and, where appropriate, include the simplest code that will
   demonstrate the issue, allowing devs to quickly verify the problem
   and ultimately to test their fix.</p>
   <p>I am aware that users raising LH tickets can potentially
   increase the workload of the triage, and I appreciate that you
   currently hold that responsibility. However, in all other respects,
   cooperating with the community in this type of way can have
   profound advantages, not least to reduce the workload of trivial
   tasks for the developers and to allow them to concentrate on the
   crucial activities on which the success of your company is
   bound.</p>
   <p>Whether your team decides to prioritise a ticket, or schedule it
   for a distant product release is obviously at your team's
   discretion. However, the benefit is that your team is able to
   rapidly gain a much more comprehensive view of its product than it
   could otherwise, which is achieved at the expense of some
   considerable time and effort on my part (in order to do it
   conscientiously).</p>
   <p>To respond to your points, I do not have helpdesk access, but I
   have signed an NDA authorised by Jeff Haynie.</p>

   <div><p>Hello Hal,</p>
   <p>I have been apprised by Don about your contributions and
   relationship, and removed my response.</p>
   <p>I am the new Engineering director, and I am learning about our
   agreements and processes every day.</p>
   <p>We'll consider this feature, and it's timing based on resourcing
   and time constraints.</p>
   <p>Regards,<br>
   ~Ralf</p></div></li>
<li>hal 2011-04-15

   <div><p>Thank you for your response, Ralf. I wish you the best in your
   new role.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>The stretchable image already exists. Instead of breaking up an
   image into 9 images, use the original image. In cases where you
   want more than the exact middle to be stretched, use the topCap and
   leftCap properties.</p></div></li>
