<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>SUMMARY<br>
When developing with Titanium on Mac OS X (e.g. 10.6.4) for the
first time, a test project may likely fail. This happened to me
internally, and per Ralf, an external OS X developer following the
same prescribed set of steps and versions of all software. The
behavior is the difference between downloading Titanium Mobile
1.4.1.1 with the test working, but using git to clone 1.5.0 (the
latest stable release), and scons to build it, results in
"execute_xcode" reporting an ERROR per the output below:</p>
<p>DIAGNOSTIC OUTPUT<br>
<a href="/projects/32238/changesets/ERROR" title=
"Changeset [ERROR]">[ERROR]</a> Error: Traceback (most recent call
last): File "/Library/Application
Support/Titanium/mobilesdk/osx/1.5.0/iphone/builder.py", line 866,
in main<br>
execute_xcode("iphonesimulator%s" %
iphone_version,["GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS=<strong>LOG</strong>ID__=%s
DEPLOYTYPE=development TI_DEVELOPMENT=1 DEBUG=1 TI_VERSION=%s" %
(log_id,sdk_version)],False)<br>
File "/Library/Application
Support/Titanium/mobilesdk/osx/1.5.0/iphone/builder.py", line 789,
in execute_xcode<br>
output = run.run(args,False,False,o)<br>
File "/Library/Application
Support/Titanium/mobilesdk/osx/1.5.0/iphone/run.py", line 31, in
run<br>
sys.exit(rc)<br>
SystemExit: 1</p>
<p>For further detail, if one sees this behavior, there's more
information in build.log (under
&lt;YOUR_PROJECT&gt;/build/iphone/build/build.log.<br></p>
<p>WORKAROUND:<br>
First by deleting the files in the project's build/iphone
directory, and then rebuilding, the error went away.</p>
<p>Ralf couldn't reproduce this:<br>
&#8226; a recent change (unknown at this point) may have created a
"build by-products" issue (i.e. in 1.5.0 from earlier),<br>
&#8226; an external developer ran into the same symptoms (see
Ralf): Titanium Developer outputs: "builder.py <a href=
"/projects/32238/changesets/ERROR" title=
"Changeset [ERROR]">[ERROR]</a>" (see above)</p>
<p>IMPACT:<br>
Developers starting from scratch, like a new (a clean Mac, fresh
installs), may benefit from this workaround, but we should explored
it more detail</p>
<p>ISSUES<br>
- Potentially renaming or moving the Titanium SDK folder doesn't
change the outcome, and adding spaces like 1.5.0 11_01 may worsens
it - Adding spaces to the Titanium SDK path may reveal further bugs
and should be tested</p></div>

   <div><p>Thomas mentioned there is a duplicate bug in Titanium Developer
   (Ticket <a href="/projects/32238/tickets/74" title=
   "Ticket #74">#74</a>), so this ticket should be related to that
   one, or put in the Titanium Developer project instead of Titanium
   Mobile (per Thomas).</p>
   <p>I was able to reproduce this "first time through" issue acting
   as an external developer on a "fresh Mac" (Mac OS 10.6.4 and iOS
   SDK 4.1)</p></div></li>

   Invalidating due to age (ticket affects 1.5, 1.6)</li>
