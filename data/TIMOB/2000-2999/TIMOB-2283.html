<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>Currently, drillbit only rebuilds the app and includes test
changes if you restart it. When writing tests or working on test
code and app code, it's very cumbersome to have to restart
drillbit, toggle tests, select the one test, then select run
tests.</p>
<p>At a minimum the harness app source should be updated with all
source just in case something changed. Ideally, the currently
selected tests should be examined for changes and updated within
the test harness to reduce round-trip time.</p>
<p>Additionally, a refresh option should be added as a global
option to force the harness source to be cleaned and then
completely regenerated w/o having to restart the framework.</p></div>

   more fixes and features for drillbit: run tests from the actual
   drillbit/tests folder instead of staging them before the app runs.
   also stage python scripts and allow each platform to stage binaries
   / source in the SDK between test runs. the drillbit UI also now
   reloads all tests everytime the "run tests" is clicked, which
   should pick up new / changed suites and tests [<a href=
