When writing tests or working on test\ncode and app code, it's very cumbersome to have to restart\ndrillbit, toggle tests, select the one test, then select run\ntests.</p>\n<p>At a minimum the harness app source should be updated with all\nsource just in case something changed. Ideally, the currently\nselected tests should be examined for changes and updated within\nthe test harness to reduce round-trip time.</p>\n<p>Additionally, a refresh option should be added as a global\noption to force the harness source to be cleaned and then\ncompletely regenerated w/o having to restart the framework.</p></div>{html}",
