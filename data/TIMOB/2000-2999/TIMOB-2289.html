<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>I tried adding a folder for drillbit tests with various names
and it refused to load the folder. When I moved the test up a level
it worked.</p>

<p>I tried adding <code>drillbit</code>, <code>tidrillbit</code>,
<code>tidbit</code> none of which would show up in the UI.</p></div>

   <div><p>what's the name of the JS file under tidb? (it should be
   tidb.js)</p></div></li>
<li>Don Thorp 2011-04-15

   <div><p>tidb.js has a file with that name. I guess I incorrectly assumed
   that I could put as many JS files under a folder as I wanted for
   organization and they could, in the future, get run as a group. For
   example, I might create 1 js file per lh ticket affecting that
   module and run only it as I work on the issue. Then afterwards run
   everything in that module to see if I'd broken anything common and
   then back out and run them all.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>Don, Marshall - Is this something to fix in M04???</p></div></li>
<li>Don Thorp 2011-04-15

   <div><p>@Ralf. No I need to reclassify it as a feature based on the
   discussion. I originally filed it not understanding the requirement
   to have the name.js match the directory.</p></div></li>

   We're not maintaining Drillbit anymore.</li>

   Drillbit has been replaced with Anvil.</li>
