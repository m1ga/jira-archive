   <div><p>From Apple docs:</p>
   <blockquote>
   <p>shouldAutoplay</p>
   <p>...</p>
   <p>The default value of this property is YES. This property
   determines whether the playback of network-based content begins
   automatically when there is enough buffered data to ensure
   uninterrupted playback.</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>Also not seeing the black screen/spinner, under either 3.2 sim
   or 4.2 device, just the autoplay change. Should this still be
   fixed?</p>
   <p>And furthermore, from our docs, regarding autoplay...</p>
   <blockquote>
   <p>autoplay[boolean]: indicates if a movie should automatically
   start playback when it is likely to finish uninterrupted based on
   e.g. network conditions. Defaults to true.</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>'Autoplay' behavior should be interpreted as "when we add a
   movie to a view, it plays." Because of how KS-iPad is structured,
   all of the views are laid out before they are ever displayed - this
   means that the video view is attached to its (undisplayed) view
   early on.</p>
   <p>Going to mark this invalid since it conforms to our
   specifications for autoplay, and commit a change to the KS-iPad
   test which sets the video's autoplay to 'false'.</p></div></li>
