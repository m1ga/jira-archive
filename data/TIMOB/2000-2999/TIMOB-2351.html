   <div><p>In addition to seeing the behavior described on device, also
   seeing the following on simulator:</p>
   <ul>
   <li>Dragging an icon to the edge of the screen will create a new
   dashboard, but the icon will not move onto it</li>
   <li>Leave the dashboard idle for a brief period of time. Coming
   back to it, it will be unresponsive and slow to scroll.</li>
   </ul></div></li>

   <div><p>Indicator tracking is correct; the indicator light shouldn't
   update until after the user has finished scrolling through pages
   (the springboard dash behaves this way as well). Unable to
   reproduce the edit invoke issue.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>could nto repro today... closing for now</p></div></li>

   <div><p>I have been having this problem a long time.<br>
   Swiping quickly enough between pages will put the dashboard in edit
   mode, and doesn't go back properly (it won't switch pages anymore).
   Try it on the device, this allows you to swipe faster.<br>
   Also I have found an issue where it shows the wrong page (look at
   the dots, also in KS) as the current page when one starts editing.
   It's shows you beeing in the last page while you are in the first
   for example.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>Edit: It seems that this quick swiping error does not happen in
   4.2, but it keeps doing it in 4.1</p>
   <p>As for the page problem, that's still a problem in 4.2</p></div></li>
<li>Thomas Huelbert 2011-04-15

   <div><p>Thanks for the info Thomas, could you tell us which mobile sdk
   build you are seeing this behavior in?</p></div></li>
