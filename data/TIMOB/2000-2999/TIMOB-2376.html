   This is a result of fullscreen splash screens transitioning to non-fullscreen windows.  The same occurs with a simple purely native (i.e., non-Titanium) Android app:
   
   <a href="http://screencast.com/t/8eLc3nsj7yT" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://screencast.com/t/8eLc3nsj7yT</a>
   
   In that video a Ti app is shown, then an Android app.  In both cases, you can see the drawn tabs shift down.
   
   Not sure why this was marked as a regression (between 1.4.2 and 1.5.0 I assume).  It could be because Kitchen Sink in 1.4.2 did *not* have a fullscreen splash screen, so you don't see this occurring in KS for 1.4.2.  But if you did have a fullscreen splash screen in 1.4.2, it would happen.
   
   I'll assign to Thomas to see if he thinks it needs to be pursued further.</li>

   Talked with Thomas. Since this is a Google issue and occurs for native apps as well it's "not our bug" so marking it invalid. Our closest state.</li>

   forgot to remove tbf-1.7.2 label.</li>

   sounds like I should have investigated this better when it was written. Thanks guys.</li>
