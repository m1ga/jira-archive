<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>Customer is asking for Quartz support on the platform. I assume
there is some support already but his request is specific:</p>
<p>"I'm curious as to the feasibility of adding quartz support to
the Ti API. We have the need to create some reasonably complex PDF
viewing applications, stuff that the simple webview can't handle.
Additionally, this could also require some drawing and/or 2d
graphic overlays. I realize this wouldn't be cross platform. Are
there any plans to support some of these deeper API's from
IOS?"</p>
