<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>This seems new as of 4.2.1 and the noted build of TiMobile
(1.5.0.3ee6a97). During the pass I encountered a number of bugs
that I believe are related to this.</p>
<p>Hard to repro, but when it occurs, this is what it looks
like:<br>
1.tapping on list view will shows the highlight, but will not seem
to load the targetted js file (however, traces show the code is
being executed)<br>
2.tap a second time<br>
results: test loads<br>
3.tap back button<br>
results: one view is replced by a second<br>
4.tap back again</p>
<p>results: finally back to tableView list</p>
<p>Only seen on 4.2.1 so far.</p></div>

   <div><p>Completely unable to duplicate on 3GT (after playing with KS for
   about five minutes, and I witnessed this "intermittent" behavior
   happening far more often in QA). Going to have to handle this later
   and confirm that it happens on 4GT/iPhone 4 only.</p></div></li>
<li>Thomas Huelbert 2011-04-15

   <div><p>seen on the 4th (4.2.1) and 3rd gen (4.0.2) with todays pull
   1.5.0.faa27c7</p></div></li>

   <div><p>On 4.1, having difficulty reproducing. Will pow-wow with Thom to
   see if he can recreate it. If not, I suppose we mark this resolved
   until we can recreate?</p></div></li>
<li>Blain Hamon 2011-04-15

   <div><p>Talked with Thom, he couldn't reproduce it. I feel uneasy as I'm
   not sure what changed, but if we can't reproduce anymore, we can't
   reproduce. Per Thom, setting this to resolved, and if it happens
   again, we'll reopen it.</p></div></li>
<li>Stephen Tramer 2011-04-15

   <div><p>I'm able to reproduce this consistently now. Using
   1.5.0.52a4db34:</p>
   <ul>
   <li>Open KS and go to Phone-&gt;Geolocation and run the test.</li>
   <li>While KS is running, background it and go into
   Settings-&gt;General-&gt;Reset-&gt;Reset location warnings</li>
   <li>Re-open KS and back out of the Geolocation test</li>
   <li>Run geolocation again, clicking "don't allow" both times to
   disallow geolocation</li>
   <li>Back out</li>
   <li>You should now see the behavior consistently when selecting the
   geolocation test.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>SHOWS ON BOTH DEBUG AND RELEASE BUILDS</p></div></li>

   [<a href="/projects/32238/tickets/2403" title=
   "Ticket #2403">#2403</a> state:fixed-in-qa] This was due to an
   interesting race condition that happens after the app has gotten a
   suspend event. We're not using the suspend bool to full use, but
   that's for later <a href=
