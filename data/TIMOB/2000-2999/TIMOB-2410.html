<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>A customer is reporting different functionality with XHR
requests on iOS and Android.</p>
<p>Ticket: <a href=
"<a href="http://developer.appcelerator.com/helpdesk/view/57021" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://developer.appcelerator.com/helpdesk/view/57021</a>"><a href="http://developer.appcelerator.com/helpdesk/view/57021" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://developer.appcelerator.com/helpdesk/view/57021</a></a></p>
<p>His second code block is different in that he's passing the
options in when the createHTTPClient is assigned. Marshall
mentioned it's possible that the callback functions have only been
tested after the object has been created, which makes sense.</p></div>
