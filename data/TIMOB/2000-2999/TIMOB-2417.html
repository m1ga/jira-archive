<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>1.5.0.91838a G2 (2.2), Droid1 (2.2) sim 2.1</p>
<p>1.Facebook &gt; log in<br>
2.Facebook &gt; publish stream &gt; tap publish stream button</p>
<p>Results: the button takes the press, but no action occurs for 3
seconds or so, looking like the app is dead. the behavior at this
point is intermittant, it did work most of the time, but
occasionally locked up on the droid1</p></div>

   <div><p>Triage in M04, may not be problematic enough to warrant
   1.5.0.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>I actually gave this a closer look than I probably should have
   (time-wise), given that we definitely won't change this sdk at all
   for 1.5 (unless something simply doesn't work.)</p>
   <p>The delay occurs in FBDialog.loadUrl. (You can see the <a href=
   "<a href="https://skitch.com/billdawson/rn48m/terminal-adb-99x28" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://skitch.com/billdawson/rn48m/terminal-adb-99x28</a>">logcat
   with timing info here</a>. That code makes a complete, invisible
   POST request before even popping up a webview -- I guess it does it
   in order to set a cookie (authorization) in the Cookie Manager
   before then showing the webview. After that's finished, it then
   finally shows the webview and navigates to the special facebook
   page that lets you make the stream entry.</p>
   <p>This code all comes from a third-party SDK -- it's very brittle
   and we're replacing it hopefully soon via <a href=
   "/projects/32238/tickets/2254" title=
   "Ticket #2254">#2254</a>.<br></p>
   <p>What's the right approach ticket-wise? I would close this
   completely ("invalid" or something) rather than push it off to
   another milestone, because I don't want to touch this third-party
   SDK -- i want to replace it. So in a sense I feel like we'll never
   actually try to make <strong>this</strong> code better/faster.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>Assigning to Thomas for his opinion on disposition.</p></div></li>
<li>Thomas Huelbert 2011-04-15

   <div><p>agree with Bill and marking as invalid. would be nice to have
   "NOB" (not our bug) for these issues. in the new bug base :)</p></div></li>

   Closed as invalid.</li>
