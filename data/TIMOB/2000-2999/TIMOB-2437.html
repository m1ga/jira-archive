<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>Steps:<br>
Updated apps from 1.4.2 r8e708e78 to 1.4.2 release<br>
Switching between windows crashes emulator Updated to 1.4.3 trunk
at rb47ae8fc<br>
This resolved crashes on emulator. Loaded app on device. App
crashes with switches between windows on device with SIGABRT</p>
<p>Date/Time: 2010-11-28 10:30:14.939 -0400<br>
OS Version: iPhone OS 4.2.1 (8C148)<br>
Report Version: 104</p>
<p>Exception Type: EXC_CRASH (SIGABRT)<br>
Exception Codes: 0x00000000, 0x00000000<br>
Crashed Thread: 0</p>
<p>To crash, window has table view. Click on row to load window.
Abort edit and return to parent. Select another row. When repeated
for third time, app crashes. 1.4.2 r8e708e78 worked properly
without issue.</p>
<p>I have seen this issue before in an earlier 1.4 release which
was previously resolved, so this would appear to be a regression.
At that time I went to a trunk release to evade the trouble. I
upgraded trunk a couple of times to stay at 1.4.2 r8e708e78 and SKD
4.1 until yesterday where I upgraded SDK to 4.2. Beyond this crash,
app functions normally.</p></div>

   <div><p>As an additional note: Building with 1.5.0 r6705da89 works
   without issue. I will be using this however, this remains an issue
   with 1.4.x</p></div></li>
<li>David Pratt 2011-04-15

   <div><p>For anyone installing 1.5.0. It requires changes in project
   settings in xcode to align with SDK 4.2, otherwise SDK will not be
   found.</p></div></li>
<li>Stephen Tramer 2011-04-15

   <div><p>Requires sample code.</p></div></li>
<li>Blain Hamon 2011-04-15

   <div><p>As per user, this is fixed in 1.5. In fact, this was due of the
   confusion over 1.4.2 release being 1.4.0, not what was labelled
   1.4.2 in the repo.</p></div></li>
