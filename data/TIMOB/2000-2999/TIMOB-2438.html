<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>I have apps with &gt; 5 tabs. Anything beyond five tabs
generates a more ... tab and window which is normal. Items
appearing in the More window are items that when row clicked will
navigate to the window for item.</p>
<p>Issue:</p>
<p>If the item clicked brings up a window with a button in the
titlebar on right, when button is clicked and return to More
window, the title of More window disappears completely. In my case
I have a Settings window with a Done button at the top to save the
settings so this is the scenario:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on Settings item in More table:<br>
More window has title of 'More'. Title appears with 'More' on left
and 'Done' on right.</li>
<li>Click 'Done':<br>
Returns to More Window. The title 'More' has disappeared.</li>
<li>Return to Settings window:<br>
'More' button on left, now no there is no title or button on
Settings window (they havd disappeared)</li>
<li>Click 'More' button:<br>
Returns to more window. 'More' title has reappeared.</li>
<li>Click on Settings:<br>
Settings title and button have reappeared.</li>
</ol>
<p>Other strange permutations may arise if item clicked from More
leads to a window with a child. For example: click item in more,
window with tableview, click on row that takes you to another
window. In this circumstance, the window of the child may end up as
the title of the More window as you navigate back to it.</p>
<p>This is on current to date 1.5.0 r6705da89 trunk. This has been
an issue for previous 1.4 releases and this madness needs to stop
:-) Perhaps most do not have many tabs. I typically have 5 or more
tabs in an app.</p></div>
