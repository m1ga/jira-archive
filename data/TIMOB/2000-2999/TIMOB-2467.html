   <div><p>What do the "some"s and "a bit" mean? That it doesn't happen
   consistently?</p>
   <p>I don't have any problem with this on a HTC Desire with 2.2.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>sorry that was a copy paste error (the config listed). Here's
   the notes from our email yesterday about the behavior I see now</p>
   <p>1.The log in screen tells me I am logged out<br>
   2.I tap log in<br>
   results: it appears as if the log in screen is launched 2X (2x
   instances of activity indicators appear and dismiss)<br>
   3.I enter data and tap log in<br>
   results: dialog asking if I want the browser to remember my
   password is invoked. I tap "not now"<br>
   results: the log in page disappears, and is replaced by a blank
   one</p>

   <p>I reliably see 2 instances of activity indicators when I tap the
   "connect with facebook button".</p>
   <p>Back to you Bill, hope that appropriate.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>Adding behavior I am seeing to make its its fixed when this is
   closed. When the log in window is invoked (see the double activity
   indicators), tapping into the text entry field will either:</p>
   <p>-not invoke keyboard -invoke keyboard but will not show chars
   until the keyboard is dismissed.</p>
   <p>As this only happens when the "double log in windows" are
   invoked, not logging a new bug. Be sure this is gone when
   closing.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>Missed in scrub for 1.5.0 to be moved to TBS</p></div></li>

   It's a pretty old ticket, and I haven't been able to reproduce today on HTC Desire (Android 2.2) or Android 2.1 emulator.  I never see this double activity indicator described here.
   
   Maybe it's magically fixed since November? :)</li>

   Tested with 1.7.2.v20110711111041 with Droid 2.2.1 and Nexus S 2.3.4, tested login and logout and login again. Not seeing the blank login or the double indicator</li>
