   <div><p>Not sure this is a regression per se we've always reported the
   activities orientation not device orientation. If they wanted
   device orientation they would set a listener for it.</p></div></li>
<li>Thomas Huelbert 2011-04-15

   <div><p>should have added : in 1.4.2 we seem to be reporting app and not
   device orientation.</p></div></li>
<li>Thomas Huelbert 2011-04-15

   <div><p>AAAAAARGH I mean device - we used to report device orientation
   in 1.4.2</p></div></li>

   <div><p>Orientation changes are reported per-Activity in Android, so the
   old app-wide behavior was probably just attached to the root
   activity, which would've been problematic as well. I don't know
   that this is necessarily a regression -- just a truer following of
   how Android deals with orientation change. Can we mark as
   invalid?</p></div></li>
