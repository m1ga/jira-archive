   <div><p>I can confirm that this doesn't work.</p>
   <pre>
   <code>var xhr = Titanium.Network.createHTTPClient();
   xhr.open('POST', 'https://someurl:2343');</code>
   </pre>
   <p>throws an xhr.onerror:</p>
   <pre>
   <code>{
   error = "Error Domain=ASIHTTPRequestErrorDomain Code=1 \"A connection failure occurred\" UserInfo=0x6c21d80 {NSUnderlyingError=0x6c1ac70 \"The operation couldn\U2019t be completed. (kCFErrorDomainCFNetwork error 2.)\", NSLocalizedDescription=A connection failure occurred}";
   source = "[object TiNetworkClient]";
   type = error;
   }</code>

   We have a helpdesk ticket (TTR-59568-869) that is having a similar 443 problem that is probably also caused by this bug. Since they are using a local server, I have no way to test it myself, but the error is the following:
   <code><pre>
   [ERROR] webserviceUtil.onerror: Error Domain=ASIHTTPRequestErrorDomain Code=1 "A connection failure occurred: SSL problem (possibly a bad/expired/self-signed certificate)" UserInfo=0x6d20150 {NSUnderlyingError=0x6d1fe00 "The operation couldnâ€™t be completed. (OSStatus error -9807.)", NSLocalizedDescription=A connection failure occurred: SSL problem (possibly a bad/expired/self-signed certificate)}
   </pre></code></li>

   We require that all SSL bugs reported with HTTPClient first use TLS versioning to check and see if that resolves the issue. Please see the documentation for [Titanium.Network.TLSVersion](<a href="http://developer.appcelerator.com/apidoc/mobile/latest/Titanium.Network.HTTPClient.tlsVersion-property.html)." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://developer.appcelerator.com/apidoc/mobile/latest/Titanium.Network.HTTPClient.tlsVersion-property.html).</a></li>

   We did not ever receive the following, which are required to resolve the ticket:
   
   * A complete working sample demonstrating the bug
   * Proof that the issue is not solved by setting Ti.Network.HTTPClient.tlsVersion to a specific value
   
   Marking this ticket as NEEDSMOREINFO as a result. If the requested information is supplied, we can reopen the ticket.</li>
