   <div><p>Hey Bill. I went to the contacts app , added new contact. The
   next time checked, it had grabbed the image from facebook and
   applied it (I used the same spelling as the fb friend) - I know
   these steps suck, as I am not 100% sure how this process occurred
   on my phone. I have another device (nexus 1) and I can try it on
   that if its helpful.</p></div></li>
