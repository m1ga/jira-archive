<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>I can sucessfully use Titanium for Ad-hoc distribution using the
"Run on Device" option inside the Titanium Developer, but when I go
for "Distribute", ad try to Share the application from XCode
Organizer it generated the new ipa but it gives me errors with
entitlements.</p>
<p>STEPS TO REPRODUCE:</p>
<p>Go to Titanium Developer 1.2.1 ( Titanium Mobile 1.4.2 ) and
select Test &amp; Package.<br>
Select the DISTRIBUTE tab.<br>
Use your app store Provisioning Profile and Standard Distribution
Profile. ( iOS SDK 4.2 )<br>
It generates an Archived Application on XCode<br>
Go to XCode (3.2.5), under the Organizer, select your application
under the Archived Applications.<br>
Click on your packaged build.<br>
Send to Apple / Appstore ( NOT SURE IF THIS STEP IS REQUIRED, BUT I
DID IT )<br>
After app submission, click on "Share..." button.<br>
Select one Ad-hoc Distribution (iPhone Developer: xxxxxxxx) for
your app ( that already works flawlessly with Titanium "Run on
Device" )</p>
<p>Now do either of those steps ( all of them fails ):</p>
<p>TRY TO LOCAL DEPLOY:</p>
<p>Click on Save to Disk and the move the generated resigned .ipa
to iTunes, it gives an entitlements error ( probably a error with
code signing )</p>
<p>TRY TO DO WIRELESS ENTERPRISE DISTRIBUTION ( Works with no
problems with Titanium - Run On Device option, but not with XCode
code resigning ):</p>
<p>Click on "Distribute for Enterprise..." enter URL (your full URL
to the generated ipa file), Title, Subtile and Image options for
your ipa.<br>
Click OK.<br>
Upload everything to your web-server (.plist and .ipa files to the
same path).<br>
Create an HTML file with a link to href =
"itms-services://?action=download-manifest&amp;url=<a href=
"http://YOUR_URL_PATH/YOURAPP.plist&quot;">http://YOUR_URL_PATH/YOURAPP.plist"</a>)<br>
Open the URL on your iDevice and click the link to install.<br>
The process will start but will fail (Download problem). ( it
doesn't fail with Titanium generated Ad-hoc ipa )</p></div>

   Mentions Titanium Developer. No longer available. We also provide adhoc builds which should handle this.</li>
