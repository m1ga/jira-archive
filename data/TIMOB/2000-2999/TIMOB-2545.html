<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>On Android, the default values for the Titanium.UI.Window
properties &#8220;fullscreen&#8221; and &#8220;navBarHidden&#8221;
change based on how the other is defined or not defined. The
obvious workaround is to explicitly set the values for them for all
windows.</p>
<p>"defaults to" means "when not specified, renders window as if
the value was explicitly set to"</p>
<ul>
<li>If navBarHidden is true, fullscreen defaults to
&#8220;false&#8221;.</li>
<li>If either fullscreen or navBarHidden is false and the other
defaults to &#8220;false&#8221;.</li>
<li>If fullscreen is true, navBarHidden defaults to
&#8220;false&#8221;.</li>
<li>If neither fullscreen or navBarHidden are defined both default
to &#8216;true&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>Have not tested this on iOS.</p>
<p>I've attached my app.js and RTF document containing screen
clips. For each of the screen clips, the values of fullscreen
and/or navBarHidden were changed or commented out and the app
rebuilt and installed on the emulator.<br></p>

   <div><p>The issue here is related to our default theme and the
   difference between "lightweight" and "heavyweight" windows.</p>
   <p>First, regarding the default theme (which we see with the splash
   screen). Sometime between 1.4.2 and 1.5.0 our default theme changed
   to fullscreen because of this commit:</p>
   <p><a href=
   "<a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/commit/13242dc433427f07697a10237ca37792a5ae8379" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/commit/13242dc433427f07697a10237ca37792a5ae8379</a>">
   <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/commit/13242dc43342..." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/commit/13242dc43342...</a></a></p>
   <p>The commit does not reference a Lighthouse ticket, so I don't
   know why it was done.</p>
   <p>Now, regarding light v heavy:</p>
   <p>When opening a window from app.js, the window will inherit our
   default theme (which is now fullscreen, as evidenced above) unless
   you specify at least one of the following properties: fullscreen,
   navBarHidden, modal or windowSoftInputMode. If you specify any one
   (or more) of those properties when creating the window, the window
   gets its own Android Activity, which defaults to Android's default
   theme, which is <strong>not</strong> fullscreen. If you do
   <strong>not</strong> specify any one of those properties, the
   window is drawn on the existing Android Activity, which is the same
   activity that showed the splash screen, and which is therefore
   fullscreen.</p>
   <p>Examples:</p>
   <ul>
   <li>
   <p>You specify none of those four properties in createWindow(): you
   get fullscreen, because it's using the same activity as the splash
   screen, which is fullscreen.</p>
   </li>
   <li>
   <p>Now specify navBarHidden (either true or false). The window will
   not be full screen anymore because it is no longer based on our
   splash screen theme, but rather based on the default Android theme,
   which is not fullscreen.</p>
   </li>
   </ul>
   <p>Not sure if we want to go back to having a non-fullscreen splash
   theme?</p></div></li>

   <div><p>@DON agreed this is not a defect? Pulled the tiapp.xml defect
   (not respecting navbar-hidden, statusbar-hidden options) into
   Sprint 2011-12: <a href="/projects/32238/tickets/3024" title=
   "Ticket #3024">#3024</a></p></div></li>
