<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>1.create a simple android project and call it "package"<br>
2.go through the steps to package it for distribution</p>
<p>results:the process fails. As per Bill "package" is a reserved
term. We should either prevent users from using this to name
projects or allow it.</p></div>

   TonyL discovered today that "case" also causes the same problem. Do we have a full list of reserved words available?</li>

   Correction to my above comment:
   
   I have determined that the *project name may contain reserved words but the app id may not*. I will link to the related ticket that correctly describes the bug.
   
   Hence:
   * Project name: "package"  // this packages successfully
   * App id: "com.appcelerator.package"  // this breaks packaging
   
   I suggest that this ticket be closed.</li>

   As stated in the previous comment, it's reserved words in the app id that causes packaging to fail rather than in the project name. Marking resolved</li>
