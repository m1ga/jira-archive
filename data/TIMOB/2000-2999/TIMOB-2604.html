<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>The android emulator is much slower than the iphone and that's a
known developer pain point. However, even deploying a very small js
change in Titanium takes an incredibly long time. Titanium
re-packages everything needed for the application and then does the
deploy. It would be great if there could be a smart compilation
step that keeps some kind of temporary package and then only
recompiles those files affected by the js changes. Or some kind of
other live debug implementation like what Livetanium has done on
the iphone. The workflow for developing android apps is extremely
slow compared to iOS. I realize this is also an android platform
issue but there certainly is room for improvement on the packaging
side within Titanium.</p></div>

   <div><p>I should mention that the emulator is kept running and the
   deploy time is not taking into account relaunching the
   emulator.</p></div></li>
