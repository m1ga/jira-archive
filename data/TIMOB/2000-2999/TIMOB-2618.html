   <div><p>We're not sure if this is developer or build scripts. Leaving in
   mobile for now.</p></div></li>
<li>Don Thorp 2011-04-15

   <div><p>Please characterize as an Android or Developer bug.</p></div></li>
<li>Bill Dawson 2011-04-15

   <div><p>Ralf, I'm unable to reproduce this under either OS X or Win XP.
   In both OS's, I removed all traces of Titanium so it would have no
   memory of an Android SDK location, as well as no downloaded SDKs --
   i.e., I started out as a new user. I downloaded latest Developer,
   got prompted like you did for the SDK 1.1 and mobile sdk 1.5.1,
   switched over to the user profile tab and filled in the Android SDK
   location, then created a new mobile project -- it found Android SDK
   just fine (green checkmark).</p>
   <p>Can you still reproduce?</p></div></li>
<li>Don Thorp 2011-04-15

   <div><p>Still needs more information. Moving to M07. So M03 is closed
   out.</p></div></li>
<li>Ralf Pfeiffer 2011-04-15

   <div><p>I am moving this to invalid, because I can't repro either and
   noone can.</p></div></li>
