   <div><p>Unless I'm missing something really hacky and tricky that we
   could do, I don't see any way to implement this in Android. We get
   the <code>scroll</code> event easily thanks to Android
   <code>View.onScrollChanged</code>. For our <code>TableView</code>,
   we can get <code>scrollEnd</code> easily thanks to Android
   <code>ListView.setOnScrollListener</code>, the listener for which
   contains <code>onScrollStateChanged</code>, which can be checked
   for <code>SCROLL_STATE_IDLE</code>. But for non-ListView scrollers
   such as the <code>ScrollView</code>, this doesn't exist.</p>
   <p>Hacky solutions like maybe checking for the first touch
   <code>UP</code> event after a <code>onScrollChanged</code> event --
   meaning the user has lifted their finger after a scroll -- wouldn't
   take into account that the view still may be flinging, and also
   wouldn't account for a scroll caused by the trackpad.</p>
   <p>In short, I can't think of any way to do this. Any ideas out
   there in Donland?</p></div></li>

   <div><p>There is some discrepancy about what this event is suppose to
   do. It appears that it was put in iOS to deal with pull for
   refresh. Android doesn't have "overscroll" until API 9. Moving to
   TBS until we can resolve what the event is suppose to do on both
   platforms.</p></div></li>
