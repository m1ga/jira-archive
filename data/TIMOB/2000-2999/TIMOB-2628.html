   <div><p>Not able to reproduce in KS-iPad. I need a test case.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>My universal app doesn't seem to suffer from this either, for
   what it's worth</p></div></li>

   <div><p>Jeff has files from Steve.<br>
   Jeff to test/repro, before commit.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>Ping Jeff to ask to test patch.</p></div></li>
<li>Don Thorp 2011-04-15

   <div><p>moving to current milestone for finalization.</p></div></li>
<li>Stephen Tramer 2011-04-15

   <div><p>Still waiting to hear from Jeff. Going to close this out or move
   to TBS unless he gets back to me.</p>
   <p>Patch is still on ice, waiting to be submitted, as well. This
   has (maybe?) been fixed for weeks (if it's even a problem... tried
   to dupe it many times and was never successful.)</p></div></li>
<li>Stephen Tramer 2011-04-15

   <div><p>Remain unable to duplicate. Going to mark fixed-in-qa.</p></div></li>
