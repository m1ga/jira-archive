<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>I have tried sdk 1.4.3, 1.5.2 and 1.6 on iPhone, they all showed
poor performance when table view row has image background. My table
has about 100 rows ( actually, it is kind of slow when it has only
20 rows too), each row has a nice image as its background. I set
rowclass, prepopulated the rows into an array then set it to
tableData, it is fast in simulator (of course it is fast with 12
CPUs), but it took 5 seconds even in iPhone 4. I ended up with a
trick, I only set 8 rows to tableData first (user can only see
first 8 anyway), then append the rest of rows to tableview with a
setTimeout function. It kind of works in iPhone 4, but not good in
older version of device.</p>
<p>I would really appreciate you look into this performance issue,
since table view is most widely used UI widget.</p></div>
