<p>Custom modules are not being packaged in the transport.py
script.</p>
<p>Users receiving the package are still having problems building
the project without installing Titanium.</p></div>

   <div><p>putting this on hold - engineering's not responsible for
   this</p></div></li>

   <div><p>Why are we putting this one hold? Obviously this is something
   that was made does not work they way it was suppose to. What do I
   tell my clients who I told they will get the xcode code?</p></div></li>
<li>Rich Baughman 2011-04-15

   <div><p>Speaking for third party developers, this needs attention from
   someone so that we can deliver completed projects to our clients
   who are not Ti users (e.g., a pure Xcode project). The script does
   not yet do this - my client was only able to compile after loading
   the Ti SDK and tweaking a few things (didn't get many helpful
   details, though).</p></div></li>

   Most recent transport.py script resolves the issues listed above.  Script is attached.</li>

   Updating bug to reflect information from TIMOB-4547. Will integrate the "new" transport.py attached to this ticket which was never committed, if relevant.</li>
<li>Stephen Tramer 2011-07-14

   transport.py was not even initially designed to support "true" export of a Titanium project as an xcode project - it does not include any of the javascript, resources, i18n, etc. files that make up a Titanium project. The "compile errors" witnessed here are essentially "this script does not even do what it advertises."</li>
<li>Ingo Muschenetz 2011-08-24

   Stephen--to integrate this into studio:
   
   * Where will this script live in the SDK?
   * Is there a minimum SDK required to use it?
   * What are the parameters we need to pass to it?</li>
<li>Wilson Luu 2011-12-07

   Closing bug. Verified fix on:
   
   OS: Mac OS X Lion
   Titanium Studio, build: 1.0.7.201112061404
   SDK build: 1.8.0.1.v20111207112258
   Device: iphone 4S Sprint (5.0.1)</li>
