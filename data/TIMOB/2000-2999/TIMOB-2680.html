   <div><p>Seeing a lot of these UI discrepancies in the 2.3 emulator, it
   seems to be buggy in general. This looks great on Nexus S -- my
   guess is Google has quite a few known UI bugs in the current
   version of the emulator. Thomas, kicking back to you for
   verification that it works on device.. not sure what else we can do
   with core tooling problems like this.</p></div></li>

   This seems like expected behavior. If you have hint text and click somewhere in the hint text, suggestions are presented. If you click at the end of the line after "textarea" it is true that the hintbar will populate then go blank. however, if you clear the field and type textarea, the hint bar only has "textarea" since "textarea" is not technically a valid word. If you clear the field and put some other non-word in the field, then place the insertion point at the end of that word, the same behavior as seen is this bug is noted.</li>

   Closing as invalid with Thomas' and Don's blessing.</li>
