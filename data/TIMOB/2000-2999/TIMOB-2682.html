   The 2.3 emulator has a known defect that means we can't use our Java <-> JS bridge (meaning any KS WebView tests will fail in the emulator). I tested this on my Nexus S and it looks fine, for
   any WebView tests we'll just have to use device only for now until Google gives us a fixed emulator.

   [~ingo] this error is still occurring with webviews on the 2.3.3 emulator, making any app running webviews reliable during testing. While the previous advice was just to avoid usage of the 2.3.3 emulator, as of TiSDK 3.1.1 the 2.3.3 Android SDK is the minimum version, so developers are extremely likely to run into the problem with higher frequency. We should revisit the issue to see if we can find an adequate workaround for the issue or this will occur much more often.</li>

   FWIW, it looks like recent posts in the google developer discussions that Marshall listed have some workarounds.</li>
<li>Ingo Muschenetz 2013-08-23

   Is it instead possible that we bump the version of the default emulator rather than fixing this via a workaround?</li>
<li>Tony Lukasavage 2013-08-24

   [~ingo] To what? At that point you are either bumping to 3.0, which is for tablets, or to 4.X, and those emulators (in my experience) take _a lot_ longer to load and are going to make for an even less appealing development experience.</li>
