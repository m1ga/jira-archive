   <div><p>I'm not able to reproduce the problem under 1.5.1 or 1.6.0.
   Service runs fine in my tests. Can you reproduce still at will?</p></div></li>
<li>Thomas Huelbert 2011-04-15

   <div><p>man, what am I doing wrong? I can accept its my issue, maybe I
   forgot how to run this test - in todays 1.5.2 and 1.6.0. Happens in
   all devices/emulators (not 2.3 specific as erroneously
   reported)</p>
   <p>1.Tap "start service via start service"<br>
   results": see output of "starting service via start service"<br>
   2.tap "check to see if test service is running"<br>
   results:Servie is NOT running.</p>
   <p>same when using the other start button. Hopei am not wasting
   everyones time here.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>Anything interesting in logcat?</p>
   <p>Also, how do you typically start KS? Here's exactly what I did
   just now (and it's working):</p>
   <ul>
   <li>Get, build and release latest 1.6.0 master.</li>
   <li>Start Titanium Developer</li>
   <li>Delete my existing Kitchen Sink project.</li>
   <li>Import Kitchen Sink project from master's
   demos/KitchenSink.</li>
   <li>On project edit screen, make sure 1.6.0 is selected.</li>
   <li>Run on Device to put Kitchen Sink on my phone (Android
   2.2).</li>
   </ul>
   <p>Then I run KS on the phone, go straight to Platform - Android
   services and test it there.</p>
   <p>I'm worried maybe you're uncovering some kind of build-time bug
   that I'm not seeing, just because of the differences there might be
   in the way we build and start Kitchen Sink.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>Hey Bill - I'm sorry its taken me so long to respond. I followed
   your steps above and see this:</p>
   <p>I/TiAPI ( 3710): (kroll$65) [1901,783069] SERVICE TEST: Starting
   via startService<br>
   W/ActivityManager( 1088): Unable to start service Intent {
   cmp=com.appcelerator.pushtest/.TestserviceService (has extras) }:
   not found<br>
   I/TiAPI ( 3710): (kroll$65) [6621,789690] SERVICE TEST: Service is
   NOT running</p>
   <p>KS 1.5.1 works as expected, 1.6.0 fails. I'm going to try to
   delete my local directory and do a clone after this pass is
   over.</p></div></li>
<li>Thomas Huelbert 2011-04-15

   <div><p>ok, I have a device with a previous version of KS 1.5.1 and the
   test works there. I republished KS on the same device using 1.5.1
   and the test now fails - meaning its media related and not sdk
   related.</p></div></li>
<li>Bill Dawson 2011-04-15

   <div><p>There still could be something wrong with our build/packaging
   process that maybe you're uncovering by some interesting set of
   circumstances.<br></p>
   <p>When you do a build/release which then fails, can you upload the
   build/android/bin/app-unsigned.apk file here? I wanna see what's in
   it. Maybe the service JS file is really not getting packaged for
   some reason.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>All is well with a clone today. closing against <a href=
   "/projects/32238/changesets/INFO" title=
   "Changeset [INFO]">[INFO]</a> Titanium SDK version: 1.6.0 (01/19/11
