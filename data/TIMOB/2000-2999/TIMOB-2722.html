<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>In an own app as well as in Kitchen Sink (try map view with
route under base ui =&gt; views) free memory drops (in tests 2 to
14(!) MB) each and every time you zoom (no matter which way). The
memory is never freed (however it doesn't seem to sink below 6MB
free memory). This is a very serious issue as apps crash or seem to
freeze when user zooms a lot and some other memory intense process
is running as well.</p>
<p>Tried the following SDKs: 1.4.2 and 1.5.1</p></div>

   I recently reimplemented the map zooming code and think that this problem has probably been fixed.  Please regress.</li>

   using 1.8.0 and an ipad2 (4.3.5) and an ipod touch (4.0.2) The massively leaking has been addressed. New bug for the small leaks seen coming.</li>
