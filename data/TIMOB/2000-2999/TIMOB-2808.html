<h3>Description</h3>

<div><h1>Feature</h1>
<p>Expose the allowsAirPlay property of MPMoviePlayerController
through Titanium.Media.createVideoPlayer so that we can stream
video and audio to Apple TV.</p>
<h1>Customer Notes</h1>
<p>There have been changes made to the MPMoviePlayerController
object within iOS adding the property allowsAirPlay. This property
allows videos to be played over airplay.</p>
<p>I have tested 1.4.2 and can verify that a
Titanium.Media.createVideoPlayer object will send audio to an Apple
TV. [But it will not send video without the property being
exposed.]</p>
<p>I was hoping that this new feature could be exposed since they
note: "You must explicitly opt-in to AirPlay playback for any movie
players you create. The allowsAirPlay property of
MPMoviePlayerController is set to NO by default."</p>

   <div><p>Exposing allowsAirPlay for audio (not just Video ) would be nice
   too. i.e. Ti.Media.createAudioPlayer()</p>

   <div><p>Can AirPlay also be supported for AudioPlayers?</p></div></li>
<li>David Fischetti 2011-05-03

   I was excited to find this. I gave it a shot and it looked like it was going to work. I received the video icon on my device (instead of just the audio icon) but when I clicked it appleTV tried to play it but then said "An Error occurred loading this content. Try again later" Not sure if I'm doing something wrong but I believe I followed all the necessary steps. Hope this helps. </li>

   Any updates here? Titanium still don't support airplay yet.</li>
<li>Sumit Kataria 2011-12-21

   Sorry about false alarm - I just tested it again with 1.8.1RC1 Airplay support works great. Thank you</li>
