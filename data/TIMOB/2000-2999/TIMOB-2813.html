<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>Android SDK: Titanium Developer, Run Emulator, "Screen" menu
shows "Loading..." while "SDK" menu displays OK.</p>
<p>See following screenshot:</p>
<p><img src=
"<a href="http://img267.imageshack.us/img267/7449/screenshot155i.png" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://img267.imageshack.us/img267/7449/screenshot155i.png</a>" alt=
"screenshot1"></p>
<p>Also, see hi-res screenshot <a href=
"<a href="http://img513.imageshack.us/img513/823/screenshot155.png" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://img513.imageshack.us/img513/823/screenshot155.png</a>">here</a></p>
<p>The problem exists when the <strong>exact</strong> android
packages are installed as in the screenshot. This has been proven a
problem on Windows 7 and Ubuntu (by me) and Mac OSX 10.6.5 (by
dtoth).</p>
<p>Workaround that resolves this completely is to close TiDev,
install the package, "SDK Platform Android 1.5" and start TiDev and
launch the app.</p></div>

   <div><p>Note, when this bug is resolved, the "SDK Platform Android 1.5"
   may be uninstalled.</p></div></li>
<li>hal 2011-04-15

   <div><p>For users who may be confused by the workaround, "SDK Platform
   Android 1.5" can be installed using the <strong>Android SDK and AVD
   Manager</strong> tool (shown in the top-left of the screenshot
   above):</p>
   <ul>
   <li>close all emulators</li>
   <li>close Titanium Developer</li>
   <li>install the "SDK Platform Android 1.5..." package</li>
   <li>delete existing AVDs using the same tool as you installed the
   package</li>
   <li>start Titanium Developer</li>
   <li>launch app</li>
   </ul></div></li>

   <div><p>I had similar problem once I've put "Android SDK path" in
   Profile with trailing space in it - profile was saved successfully,
   but Developer was unable to load SDK list and showed "loading"
   forever.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>The same issue is with my development too. I don't get SDK list
   and also Screen list showed "loading...". Let me know if you have
   resolved the above issue you got. It would be helpful. Thanks. All
   the steps are properly followed as given in installation pdf
   file.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>I've had similar problem, path to Android SDK didn't have
   trailing slash, I've added trailing slash and problem was solved. I
   guess the problem is with Android SDK path and trailing slash.</p>

   <div><p>I have the same issue, on Windows 7 (x64)... I've tried a few
   things include moving the Android sdk folder between the program
   files and program files (x86) folders, but no luck (obviously
   updated the titanium sdk path and environment variables each
   time).</p>
   <p>Still says "Loading...", so annoying.</p>
   <p>I run Process Monitor and noticed Titanium developer was looking
   for the file "QUSEREX.DLL" in the sdk tools folder, obviously this
   doesn't exist (I've heard it's known to be used for hacking and
   searching for specific files), any ideas on this?</p>
   <p>Many thanks,<br>
   Ryan (droidexposure)</p></div></li>

   <div><p>Further to my question about the odd "QUSEREX.DLL", here's a
   screen shot (attached) a link for security information on it...

   <p>Just a little bit scary...</p></div></li>

   We no longer support Titanium Developer, please download and use Titanium Studio instead. Ticket marked as invalid. </li>
