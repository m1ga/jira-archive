   Tested on Kitchen Sink running 1.6.2 (Apr 18 2011 14:44 r878906de) and iPhone Simulator 4.3
   
   When zooming to max level, the route disappears, but reappears when zooming back out.

   Kitchen Sink, and my own app with 1.6.2 this happens.  Rather unexpected.
   
   1.5.1 also broken, both with SDK 4.3
   
   I attempted to go a far back as 1.4.0, but then with 4.3 it wouldn't even start.

   A pity this bug is open for such a long time.</li>
<li>Carsten Moehrke 2011-08-10

   No, it's not "a pity". It's a major pain in the ass and it sucks badly...
   It really sucks that nobody takes care of it. Even though Titanium mobile is a great tool I sometimes doubt if it's worth the money </li>
<li>Alexander Bauer 2011-08-10

   It seems that the problem is located in TiMapRouteAnnotationView.m 
   within the: -(void) regionChanged method
   
   origin = [mapView convertPoint:origin toView:self]; // on certain zoom-level it returns huge coordinates, on each double tap it increases about by 500 pixels, if you reach this "certain zoom-level" it jums to values about million which seems definitely wrong and your route is out-of-view</li>

   Removed the 1.8.0 fixVersion. Code has not been merged.</li>
<li>Reggie Seagraves 2011-08-29

    Process pull request.</li>
<li>Eric Merriman  2011-09-23

    Verified fixed with SDK 1.8.0.v20110922234950, iPhone 4 verizon (4.2.10), and iPod touch 3rd gen (4.0.2)</li>
