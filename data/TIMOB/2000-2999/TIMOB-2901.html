<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>Hi! :)</p>
<p>Note: This is about the iPhone part of Titanium</p>
<p>To describe the problem i'm facing right now, please open (and
start the stream):<br>
KitchenSink &gt; Phone &gt; Sound &gt; Remote Streaming</p>
<p>When first starting the stream, it is doing what it is supposed
to do; display the progress in seconds. But if you stop/pause te
stream, and then fire it up again, it won't update the progress or
start at 0 seconds.</p>
<p>It seems to me like this isn't normal behaviour :)</p>
<p>I'm using Titanium Developer 1.2.2, Titanium mobile SDK 1.5.1,
iPhone SDK 4.2</p></div>

   <div><p>I am seeing the same issue in my app and in the kitchen
   sink.</p></div></li>
<li>Jay J 2011-04-15

   <div><p>+1 for this.. PLEASE sort this out. This is my 3rd failed app
   and over 400 programming hours wasted because of all the bugs and
   problems with Titanium.</p>
   <p>This ticket is 22 days old and still classed as new.</p>
   <p>Lets see the bugs so far in doing this simple app:</p>
   <p>AudioPlayer<br>
   <em>progress not working after stop &amp; start</em> event listener
   "change" not working (downgrade the SDK and it does) <em>setUrl
   crashes app</em> volume control - not a bug, but why isn't this in
   there yet?</p>
   <p>PS: I am using 1.5.1</p></div></li>
<li>Jordy 2011-04-15

   <div><p>@Jay J, the change/state eventlistener is fixed in 1.6 (for
   me)</p>
   <p>1.6 didn't bring a fix for this bug as described by me in the
   first post.</p></div></li>
<li>Jay J 2011-04-15

   <div><p>I tried using 1.6 from <a href=
   "<a href="http://builds.appcelerator.com.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://builds.appcelerator.com.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html</a>"><a href="http://builds.appcelerator.com.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://builds.appcelerator.com.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html</a></a></p>
   <p>For some reason it doesn't compile, I tried 1.6.x and master. Is
   there a stable version available?</p>
   <p>Anyway I hope the appcelerator team can focus on fixing bugs
   more promptly. Developing apps for clients on a deadline is
   impossible with Titanium as you will never know what is not going
   to work because it seems to change from version to version.</p></div></li>
<li>Jay J 2011-04-15

   <div><p>Is there any version of the SDK that fixes this progress bug? I
   can't find any 1.4, 1.5.0, 1.5.1, 1.5.2...</p></div></li>
<li>Jordy 2011-04-15

   <div><p>@Jay J: no there's no fix yet</p></div></li>
<li>Chris 2011-04-15

   <div><p>It has not been fixed with 1.6</p></div></li>

   <p>Testing Code attached.</p>
   <p>Tested on 1.6 and 1.7 (03/10/11).</p>
   <p>No error message, just no progress.</p></div></li>
<li>Eric Merriman  2011-05-12

   This still occurs with iPhone 4, iOS 4.3.3. KS 1.7.0, build 1.7.0.879871b. Using the test app - once stopped, then restarted, the "Time played" remains fixed at whatever time the stream was stopped.</li>
<li>Eric Merriman  2011-05-12

    Fixed. Closing.</li>
