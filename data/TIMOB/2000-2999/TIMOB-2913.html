<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>Android already has something like this, where they can select
display type when running their simulator. iOS needs to offer
something similar for iPhone/iOS Universal where users can select
what simulated device they want to run their app on. Especially
important for universal, since users will need to test on both
devices.</p></div>

   [<a href="/projects/32238/tickets/2913" title=
   "Ticket #2913">#2913</a> state:fixed-in-qa] builder.py now takes an
   additional argument to indicate simulated device type (NOT
   deviceFamily, necessarily). <a href=

   <div><p>Not really clear what the fix is. I ran an iPhone app on the
   iPad simulator (changed hardware-&gt;device from iPhone to iPad)
   and it shows as an iPhone app (small). Checked the builder.py and
   the changes that Jeff made are there, but the app is still an
   iPhone app and not a universal app. What are the steps to make this
   work?</p>
   <p>Ti. SDK 1.6 (Jan 25 2011 17:39 r1ead074f)</p></div></li>

   <div><p>Selecting which device to run on is not the same as universal
   support. Running an iphone app on an ipad SHOULD make it show up in
   normal scale with the "2x" button. But this is still a valid
   configuration and people should be able to test it.</p>
   <p>The short answer is "you don't test this or any other build
   script features until the new Titanium Developer comes out."</p>
   <p>The longer answer is to look at how the build script takes
   arguments for existing projects and then add a new argument at the
   end, either 'iphone' or 'ipad', which determines which device the
   simulator starts as.</p>
   <p>Also, Jeff didn't make any of the universal changes, I made them
   all.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>Tested Ti Dev 1.3</p>
   <p>Works as expected.</p></div></li>
