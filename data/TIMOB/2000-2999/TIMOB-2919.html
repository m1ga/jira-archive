<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>Hi, I use sdk 1.51 and have some problem with high-res
image.</p>
<p>I have found 2 cases, and have only found a workaround for one
of both.</p>
<p>1 - if the remote image (let's say 120x120 pix) is downloaded is
downloaded and saved in the document folder and saved as
myimage.jpg and I do :</p>
<p>img = Ti.UI.createImageView({<br></p>
<pre>
<code>            image:myimage.jpg,
            width:60,
            height:60
        });</code>
</pre>
<p>image appear pixelated... never found this problem on XCode. to
make it work the workaround is to save the image as <a href=
"mailto:myimage@2x.jpg">myimage@2x.jpg</a>, while keeping the url
of file to myimage.jpg. This is a workaround but not logic in my
mind, this need to be fix in SDK.</p>
<p>now if the image is not save to the iphone but the "remote" url
is used directly (image is still 120x120) and imageview size is
60x60, the image appear pixelated. For this, I didn't found a
workaround. I see on the Q&amp;A that someone use a webview to fix
this, but this is a bad idea when it is in a cell of tableview,
webviews eat a lot of ressources.</p>
<p>Any help or fix is welcome.</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>Armindo</p></div>
