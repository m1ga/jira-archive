<h3>Description</h3>

<div><h1>Problem</h1>
<p>When opening a window and focusing a text field, the events that
fire are very inconsistent across Android and iOS. One way they are
inconsistent is that Android will bubble events out, while iOS does
not.</p>
<p>For example... you open a window, and click in a text field.</p>
<p>On iOS, the events fire in this order: window focus, textfield
focus.</p>
<p>On Android, the events fire in this order: textfield focus,
window focus, textfield click, window click.</p>
<h1>Expected Behavior</h1>
<p>Events should be consistent across the platforms. Perhaps it
could be optional to turn on event bubbling on iOS, and it could be
made optional by default on Android as well.</p>
<h1>Tested On</h1>
<p>Titanium Mobile 1.6.0 1/19/11<br>
iPhone Simulator 4.2<br>
Android Simulator 2.2</p>
<h1>Sample Code</h1>
<p>Attached. Follow the instructions in the Ti.UI.Label created by
the app, and look at the Ti Developer console to see when events
are firing and if they are expected or not.</p>
<p>In the iPhone simulator, my console showed the
following:<br></p>
<pre>
<code>[INFO] PASS: window-focus fired
[ERROR] FAIL: Skipped expected textfield-click
[INFO] PASS: textfield-focus fired</code>
</pre>
<p>Android showed the following:<br></p>
<pre>
<code>[ERROR] [2257,2269] FAIL: textfield-focus fired when expected window-focus
[INFO] [4,2273] PASS: window-focus fired
[INFO] [4,2741] PASS: textfield-click fired
[ERROR] [29,2770] FAIL: window-click fired when expected textfield-focus</code>

   Tested with 2.0.1GA2 and got the following result:
   
   iOS simulator:
   [INFO] PASS: window-focus fired
   [ERROR] FAIL: Skipped expected textfield-click
   [INFO] PASS: textfield-focus fired
   
   Samsung Galaxy S2 (2.3.6):
   INFO/TiAPI(14291): PASS: window-focus fired
   ERROR/TiAPI(14291): FAIL: Skipped expected textfield-click
   INFO/TiAPI(14291): PASS: textfield-focus fired
   
   
   I'm not sure if the 'expected textfield-click' should fail or not, therefore I haven't closed this ticket. Please review and take appropriate actions.</li>
