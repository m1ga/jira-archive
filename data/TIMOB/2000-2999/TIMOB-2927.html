<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>After setting the http basic header like this</p>
<p>http_client.setRequestHeader('Authorization', 'Basic ' +
Titanium.Utils.base64encode(email + ':' + password));</p>
<p>Authentication works fine. so let's say i have a button that
creates a new http_client object and makes an authenticated
request. if i do it the first time everything is great. now if i
change the email/password http_client keeps using the old
authorization header. even on completely different http_client
objects! even after i've set the header to null or set it to
credentials for a different user. it always uses the first
authorization header set. to log in as a different user i'm having
to completely close the application and open it again.</p></div>

   <div><p>Assuming this is an Android bug (there's no shared persistent
   store on iOS that would cause this issue). Assigning to Don for
   triage.</p></div></li>
