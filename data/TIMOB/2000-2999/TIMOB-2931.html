<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>Currently in our build tooling/Titanium Developer, we don't
support changing the project name or the application name as it
appears on the device home screen. It would be good to be able to
change the displayable name for the application through
configuration in tiapp.xml - for iOS you could do this by manually
editing Info.plist, but there's currently no way to do it for
Android except creating a new project. Seems like a pretty critical
config element, warranting inclusion in tiapp.xml.</p></div>

   rollback wrong update</li>
<li>Chris Barber 2013-07-31

   This isn't an issue anymore with Titanium SDK 3.1.1. You can rename an Android app by changing the <name> tag in the tiapp.xml and it will properly set the name in the Android manifest and the various generated Java files.</li>
