   <div><p>I'm hesitant to add such a functionality in, because it presents
   a slippery slope. Why would we stop at one HTTPClient feature? When
   you use a coverflow view, which allows for remote images as well,
   should this functionality also be allowed? How would you represent
   this; do you have one setting that applies to all images in the
   array, or can you specify per-image?</p>
   <p>All of this gets even messier when you realize that the
   imageView isn't the one doing the actual connecting, and that it's
   possible that multiple imageViews could be wanting to load the same
   image, where one wants to load with ABC:true, the other with
   ABC:false.</p>
   <p>There is already a problem where ImageView is being treated as a
   magical image handling, downloading, and manipulation utility,
   instead of what it really is: A view that shows an image. The much
   better behavior is that the end dev uses HTTPClient to download the
   file, and show that. That even has the advantage of taking up less
   memory.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>That is true, but in my case I have a scrollable view loaded
   with image views and it had memory issues related with:<br>
   - <a href=
   "<a href="http://developer.appcelerator.com/helpdesk/view/46321" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://developer.appcelerator.com/helpdesk/view/46321</a>"><a href="http://developer.appcelerator.com/helpdesk/view/46321" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://developer.appcelerator.com/helpdesk/view/46321</a></a>
   Now the scrollable view filled with image views works like a charm
   but only if I put url to image property. In my case (at the moment)
   there is max 100 pics per scrollable view and only one scrollable
   view can be shown in my app. If I put binaries instead of url's to
   image property, when simulating picture slide show, the application
   after some time still crashes, but if I use url's it works forever
   :). I rewrote several times this application I'm working on for
   almost a year using first url's, then, after it stopped working
   with self-signed certificates, I used HTTPClient to fetch image
   base64, and then again using url's because of stability of my
   app.<br>
   Currently, I have a switch to switch between these approaches for
   future :).<br>
   But seriously, with url's it works excellent and I'm very happy
   with it, but at the current moment I gave up from SSL although I
   have everything ready for that in my app and on my picture server
   that serves the pics. And that is a feature I don't want to give up
   for next version if not for the initial, even if that means
   rewriting the whole app in objective C.</p>
   <p>So I think that for one or some more pics it's a good approach
   to use HTTPClient to get the pics, but for more, from my experience
   it's not. For some reasons, that I don't know and you guys probably
   know why, when using url's the whole concept of scrollable view
   works much faster when scrolling left-right.<br>
   If my whole concept somewhere misses something please correct
   me.</p></div></li>

   Are there any updates? As Marko wrote it's often not that easy or even not possible to handle this when viewing for example more than 100 pics. The users of my app connect to their own server and they want to display images from their own server. But a lot of users do have HTTPS with self signed certificates and they are not able to view images.
   
   Maybe it would be create to have the possibility to set a "HTTPClient" dependency like this: 
   <code><pre>
   Ti.UI.createImageView({image: httpsUrl, httpClient: httpClientWithValidatesSecureCertificateDisabled});
   </pre></code>
   Don't know whether something like this is possible.</li>

   This is a duplicate of a WON'TFIX ticket. You can use SSL-enabled HTTP clients to retrieve images and display them in an image view, including the appropriate crossfade.</li>
<li>Stephen Tramer 2012-03-20

   This issue duplicates WON'TFIX issue TIMOB-7470, which includes a code snippet demonstrating how to pull image data with the appropriate crossfade.</li>

   Closing ticket as duplicate with reference to the linked issues.</li>
