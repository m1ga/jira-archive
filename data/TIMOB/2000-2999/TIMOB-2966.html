   Out of curiosity, what is the use case of this? Tab groups on iOS, natively, don't report click events, as the native code handles all of that. If we can avoid adding bloat and possible fragility that introducing non-native click handling of the actual tabs themselves, that'd be preferable.</li>

   After talking with CE, it turns out the customer needed something already provided that is NOT solved by intercepting the touch events.
   
   We need to update the docs because tabs are not views, and tabgroups are window-like, not views. Marking as won't fix (Or invalid).</li>
