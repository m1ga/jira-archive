<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>Please allow a text label to be specified in the
Titanium.UI.createDashboardItem() function. Forcing the developer
to create the label in the image is horrible for localization.</p></div>

   <div><p>+1 from me.</p>
   <p>I just got around to needing to use the dashboardView and was
   disappointed to see that the labels are use as simple properties in
   the KS example and not as actual labels.</p>
   <p>I had a go at using a container view containing an image and a
   label, which does work, however you lose the ability to have a
   selected state on the image. I also tried using a button, but the
   dashboardItem 'steals' the click event and so there's no way to
   show the button being pressed.</p>
   <p>From my experience over the past few hours trying all sorts of
   ideas out, it seems the dashboardView needs some love and
   attention, as soon as possible for it to be as useful as it could
   be.</p></div></li>
