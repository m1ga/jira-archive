<h3>Description</h3>

Today we offer plugin support for Studio to publish into the AirWatch and MobileIron workflows. Apperian also offers a plugin that they provide and support that does the same.

We should make it equally easy to configure and push builds from the CLI as well.

Initial support should duplicate what we have today - AirWatch / MobileIron.

Additional Systems to keep on the radar:

* Good Technology
* Citrix
* Apperian
* Maas360 / Mocana
