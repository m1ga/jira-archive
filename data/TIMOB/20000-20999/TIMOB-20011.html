<h3>Description</h3>

There is a need to allow JavaScript files and possibly other resources to be bundled into an app that live outside the Resources directory. In the case of JavaScript files, special handling needs to be done so that they are AST parsed for Titanium APIs and then encrypted for non-development builds.

This feature would be exposed to CLI hooks. A CLI hook could simply modify the list of jsFiles that were found while recursing the Resources directory before performing the analysis and encryption.

Because we're allowing external files to be bundled, we may need to expose differential build logic. If just injecting files, then it should be fine, but if modifying any existing files will most likely require touching the <code>currentBuildManifest</code> state.
