<h3>Description</h3>

We have separate builds of the SDK done against Win 8.1 and Win 10. We need to package both versions up into a single zip that is used in the main SDK.

We can't just mash together the two zips, as we need to adjust where the WIn10 builds get packaged up in the final zip. Right now they're under store/x86 and store/ARM. They probably should be under something like "win10/x86" and win10"ARM" since they're supposed to be universal for Win10 store/phone.

   PR was merged to produce the win10 artifacts to specific location in the zip file. We still need to generate a unified zip with both 8.1 and 10 artifacts...</li>

   The titanium_mobile_windows build now fires off two sub-builds one for Win 8.1 and one for Win 10 and then combines the artifacts together: <a href="http://studio-jenkins.appcelerator.org/job/titanium_mobile_windows/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://studio-jenkins.appcelerator.org/job/titanium_mobile_windows/</a>
   
   We need to fix a compiler warning on Windows 10, and tehre are other tickets about getting unit tests running on Win 10</li>
