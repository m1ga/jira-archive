<h3>Description</h3>

This is my layout from some days ago:
!<a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/507021/IMG_0024.jpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/507021/IMG_0024.jpg</a>!
And after the last updates I have the layout all messed up like this:
!<a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/507021/Captura%20de%20ecr%C3%A3%202015-11-30%2C%20%C3%A0s%2009.45.32.png" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/507021/Captura%20de%20ecr%C3%A3%202015-11-30%2C%20%C3%A0s%2009.45.32.png</a>!

I don't remember changing any source code that could cause this behavior, anyone else having problems with SplitView ?
Master view seems smaller with objects on top of each other and got no right black vertical border.

   Please provide a simple test case that best replicates the issue, also attach your full working environment info.
   
   Thanks.</li>

   The left view shrinks, it´s not the default 320 pixels anymore. Also, the black vertical line that splits the views disappear .
   
   Test Sample: 
   Just use this alloy code:
   <Alloy>
   	<SplitWindow backgroundColor="white" showMasterInPortrait="true" >
   		<!-- First window is the masterView -->
   		<NavigationWindow>
   			<Window>
   				<Label backgroundColor="cyan" top="0" width="240" textAlign="center">240p</Label>
   				<Label backgroundColor="lightgray" top="20" width="260" textAlign="center">260p</Label>
   				<Label backgroundColor="red" top="40" width="300" textAlign="center">300p</Label>
   				<Label backgroundColor="yellow" top="60" width="320" textAlign="center">320p</Label>
   			</Window>
   		</NavigationWindow>
   
   		<!-- Second window is the detailView -->
   		<Window  backgroundColor="white" title="Master">
   			<Label>I am the detail view.</Label>
   		</Window>
   	</SplitWindow>
   </Alloy>
   
   
   Output:
   !<a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/507021/Captura%20de%20ecr%C3%A3%202015-12-01%2C%20%C3%A0s%2005.35.52.png" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/507021/Captura%20de%20ecr%C3%A3%202015-12-01%2C%20%C3%A0s%2005.35.52.png</a>! 
   
   Seems that the view width which previously was 320 pixels, now it´s just about 260.</li>

   I corrected this issue by setting in my style.tss
   "SplitWindow": { landscapeSplit: 0.3125}
   It corrects the width, but not the divider ;-(</li>

   I´m having several issues with the last update. SplitWindow problems, data binding that doesn't show up, parts of the views that don't refresh, etc... I can't program like this until all this mess is fixed. Unfortunately, this last update is more like a nightly build and not a stable or beta release. </li>
<li>Luis Galhardo 2015-12-07

   Problem seems related to CLI 5.1.0, using: *appc use 5.0.4* I have SplitWindow working fine again, divider shows, and all other problems I had are not happening </li>
<li>Angel Petkov 2015-12-10

   Hello , I'm sorry to hear that your experiencing issues with the platform. Unfortunately this isn't something that can be fixed , as its technically not a bug. The reason the masterView use to be 320p as oppose the current size. Is because when using "SplitWindow" in alloy it automatically chooses the class to be used and it use to chose an older class which is now deprecated(<a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#</a>!/api/Titanium.UI.iPad.SplitWindow). Within that class the masterView was hard coded to 320p as [~sdarda] pointed out. 
   
   However the newer splitWindow(<a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#</a>!/api/Titanium.UI.iOS.SplitWindow) sets the masterView to a percentage of the total width.This was one of the reasons the old split window was deprecated, the size of the view shouldn't be hard coded as it will cause issues when running on new devices. For example if this application was to be ran on the new iPad pro , the masterView would stay at 320p which is not something we want, the masterView should stay the same size in proportion to the details view. </li>

   What about the vertical divider ? Doesn't show anymore .</li>
<li>Sergey Nosenko 2016-03-30

   I have to use old splitWindow and do small workaround to use it with Alloy:
   
   ./lib/ipad.js
   
   <code><pre>
   exports.createSplitWindow = function (args) {
       return Ti.UI.iPad.createSplitWindow(args);
   };
   </pre></code>
   
   and in main.xml
   
   <code><pre>
   &lt;Alloy&gt;
       &lt;SplitWindow id="root" module="ipad"&gt;
   </pre></code>
   
   </li>

    Sergey Nosenko, just what I needed. Thank you :) </li>
