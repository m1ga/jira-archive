<h3>Description</h3>

My team is working on a social app which uses a lot of remote images. After we upgraded to Titanium SDK 5.1.1 GA and change the android:targetSdkVersion to 23 we ran into an issue when none of the remote images are loading. This is a very big issue from our understanding, since all of the devices with Android 6 will not show any remote images. In the screenshot attached, you can see a simple app which is basically a window with an ImageView. The ImageView is using a random remote image. The image loads on Android 5, but on Android 6 it doesn't.

   Alternatively, as you mentioned, setting the Android SDK to version 22, will force it to use the old Permissions system even on Android 6.0. This will grant the permissions automatically on run time.
   
   To do this, you need to use an Titanium SDK 5_0_X version. I recommend 5.0.3. via <code><pre> appc ti sdk install --branch 5_0_X</pre></code>. You can then add these lines to your manifest in TiApp.xml:-
   <code><pre>
       &lt;android xmlns:android="<a href="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android</a>"&gt;
           &lt;manifest&gt;
               &lt;uses-sdk android:targetSdkVersion="22"/&gt;
           &lt;/manifest&gt;
       &lt;/android&gt;
   </pre></code>
   
   This will allow remote images to load as the permissions are granted via the old permission system.</li>

   Thanks guys!
   
   Requesting camera permissions fixed the issue!</li>

   Maybe this module helps: <a href="https://github.com/gimdongwoo/Ti-Android-RequestStoragePermission" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/gimdongwoo/Ti-Android-RequestStoragePermission</a></li>

   I tried to send a downgraded version 23=>22
   This is the error message from playstore:
   
   "This configuration can not be published for the following reasons:
   
        It is forbidden for devices that were originally using M-permissions (for SDK 23 and above) to perform a downgrade to APKs, the old-style permissions to use (for SDK 22 and lower). This comes with a change of version 42 (for SDK 23) prior to version 43 (for SDK 22)."</li>

   Just an update. There is a fix in TIMOB-20251 that solves the issue of remote images. There shouldn't be any permissions required.</li>

   [~bimmel] this or TIMOB-19899 (same issue) should be in the 5.2.0 release notes as well.</li>
<li>Fokke Zandbergen 2016-02-18

   [~bimmel] never mind, TIMOB-20251 is mentioned, although I find this ticket's title clearer since it's the actual bug people experienced.</li>
