<h3>Description</h3>

I am not able to see the push notification in the multiline format on the android device. I have used the same payload structure that is defined in the documentation [<a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#</a>!/guide/Subscribing_to_push_notifications-section-37551717_Subscribingtopushnotifications-Parsinganotificationpayload]

 {
    "android": {
        "title": "myApp",
        "alert": "Here, I want to send the multiline push notification messages to the user for the \n details reports.",
        "icon": "little_star",
        "badge": 3,
        "sound": "door_bell",
        "vibrate": true,
    },
}

   Hello [~rpeshwe], Appcelerator doesn't have support for multiline push notification. This could be a new feature. Most of the applications at the market doesn't have the feature in them. But Android has a process to [add multiline push notification](<a href="http://tips.androidhive.info/2015/04/android-showing-push-notification-in-multiline/)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://tips.androidhive.info/2015/04/android-showing-push-notification-in-multiline/)</a> feature. To use the feature in Appcelerator you need to build a custom module for that. See the [doc](<a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#</a>!/guide/Android_Module_Development_Guide) link. Thanks.</li>

   To do this, you would need <a href="http://developer.android.com/intl/ru/reference/android/app/Notification.BigTextStyle.html." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://developer.android.com/intl/ru/reference/android/app/Notification.BigTextStyle.html.</a>
   
   This ticket is a new feature request and this has been resolved with this ticket TIMOB-20066. Resolving this as duplicate as it has been addressed. </li>

   I think this feature is included in almost all apps now. Its supported since Android 4.1 or 4.2.</li>

   Hi,
   I have tried the multiline notification on android device after creating build using titanium sdk 5.4.0.GA
   Still facing the issue while sending multiline notification from GCM server on an Android device.
   Found that the *TIMOB-20066* issue is related to the *local notification* while I am trying to send the notification from the *server.*
   Can you please check the multiline notification for notification getting from *server.*
   As *TIMOB-20066* ticket is for local notification.</li>
<li>Ashraf Abu 2016-09-02

   Ticket reopened to investigate multiline notification for notifications from servers.</li>
<li>Muhammad Qasim 2016-09-19

   Are there any plans to support the BigTextViewStyle in ti.cloudpush? This is a very common and useful feature now and should be implemented without asking!</li>
<li>Pravin 2017-05-10

   Hi, Is it resolved in new SDK ? 6.0.3 ? I have tested on SDK 6.0.0 but issue is still there.
   
   Do we have any solution for this ?
   
   Regards,
   Pravin </li>

   Hi! There is any solution to this issue?</li>
<li>Dirlei Dionísio 2017-08-22

   Hi guys, multiline notifications exists since Android 4.1. We now are on Android 8. Is there any plan to support this feature on ti.cloudpush? Not having this feature nowadays is a big disadvantage for those using ArrowDB.
   
   This issue is marked as duplicated but it's a mistake. #TIMOB-20066 is about Local Notifications but the requested feature here is about Remote Notifications.
   
   It would be very appreciated if we could use this so common feature on Android through Appcelerator/Axway services.</li>
<li>Hans Knöchel 2017-10-17

    Let's talk about it! If this is an Android issue, we should be able to fix this in the SDK. [~gmathews] [~ybanev] thoughts? 
    
    *EDIT*: PR (poc): <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/aps_sdk/pull/302" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/aps_sdk/pull/302</a>
    
    Example:
    <code><pre>
    {
      "android": {
        "title": "myApp",
        "alert": "Here, I want to send the multiline push notification messages to the user for the \n details reports.",
        "style": {
            "bigContentTitle": "myApp",
            "bigText": "Here, I want to send the multiline push notification messages to the user for the \n details reports.",
            "summaryText": "Here, I want to send the multiline push notification messages",
        }
      }
    }
    </pre></code></li>

    Can anyone at Appcelerator please say if this will be supported some day?
    
    Or... can ti.cloudpush be open sourced?</li>
<li>Hans Knöchel 2018-02-05

    Hey everyone! The related PR's just have been merged and will be available via dashboard later this week.</li>
<li>Dirlei Dionísio 2018-02-26

    Thanks [~hknoechel] !
    
    How about showing a custom image (not icon) in the push? Will it be possible?</li>
<li>Hans Knöchel 2018-02-26

    [~dirleidionisio] I have no idea. That is completely different feature request.</li>
<li>Dirlei Dionísio 2018-02-26

    [~hknoechel] Any chance of open source ti.cloudpush so I can help to implementing it?</li>
<li>Lokesh Choudhary 2018-03-14

    Good job, guys!
    
    In order to use this feature I need to know: how can I send multiline notifications using Appc dashboard or API? The docs are not updated.</li>
<li>Beau Gibson 2018-03-23

    Updated to 7.2.0.v20180314132221 but the notifications still get trimmed after 1 line.
    Is this something we need to set when registering or when sending the push?</li>
<li>(deactived) Brian Immel 2018-04-09

    [~aislam], I added your sample payload example to <a href="https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides2/Subscribing+to+push+notifications." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides2/Subscribing+to+push+notifications.</a> It will be published on the next doc push (after April 19th?) or soon if you think it warrants my time to do so.</li>
<li>Hans Knöchel 2018-05-26

    [~dirleidionisio] In case you did not find it out already, the docs have recently been updated to reflect an example, see [this guide](<a href="https://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#</a>!/guide/Subscribing_to_push_notifications-section-src-37551717_Subscribingtopushnotifications-Parsinganotificationpayload) and "Sample payload sent push notification in the multiline format on an Android device" for details!</li>
<li>Dirlei Dionísio 2018-05-26

    Thank you Hans, I'll check it soon.</li>
