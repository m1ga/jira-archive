<h3>Description</h3>

Many people are shouting because they have to close their appc projects and re-do it using native platforms, as not support for Ti.NFC anymore despite the Appcelerator documentation is full of objects supporting it.

Now all project using i.NFC is crashing and stopping at splash screen ( despite getting tag information ). Lot of people are asking about it in different community and no one from Appcerlerator responsible are replying, so please fix it or announce that its support are removed totally.

   I managed to compile the module with the lastest NDK, works fine for me : <a href="http://www.jskl.fr/ti.nfc-android-1.3.zip" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.jskl.fr/ti.nfc-android-1.3.zip</a></li>

   Hey there, I am very sorry this was not noticed before. In case you are still here and use Ti.NFC, I'd like to know if this is still present with the 2.0.0 released last year together with SDK 6.0.0. As we just supported the parity with iOS, we'd like to ensure there are no open problems with Android as well. Thanks!</li>

   The docs have been updated to show how to use it in modern applications (also in parity with iOS). Read more about the example in the last comments in TIMOB-20142.</li>
