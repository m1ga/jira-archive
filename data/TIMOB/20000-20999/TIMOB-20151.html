   I'm not sure what to do about this one. Basically this looks like a one-off configuration problem, though I honestly have no idea why or how it'd happen. By default in both the System and my user PATH the powershell bin directory is listed. That should be the case for every Windows system.
   
   I think unless we start seeing more reports of this, this may just be a fluke. If it's common, I suppose we'll need to add special code for finding Powershell at the standard location when it's not on the PATH?</li>

   For now, will close ticket as "Not Our Bug".</li>

   @ Wilson, did you resolve this problem. I am facing it and have no solution. I am using Window 8 and all other path variables are set accordingly including the power shell directory added in my path.</li>

   [~Umair], At the moment, there is no fix for this issue as per Chris's comment. Can you provide the following information:
   * The stack trace you are seeing.
   * The versions you are using for:
   ** Appc CLI NPM: Version property in <code>C:\Users\&lt;USER&gt;\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules\appcelerator\package.json</code>
   ** Appc CLI Core: <code>C:\Users\&lt;USER&gt;\.appcelerator\install\.version</code>
   ** Titanium SDK: SDK selected property in <code>C:\Users\&lt;USER&gt;\.titanium\config.json</code>
   ** Node version: <code>node -v</code>
   ** Architecture of your Node: 32-bit or 64-bit
   ** Architecture of your Windows OS
   * And, after you set the path, did you try restarting your Windows machine?</li>

   I was on Windows 8.1 and yes after restart, I dont know what happened but the issue is fixed :)</li>
