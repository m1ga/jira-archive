<h3>Description</h3>

After pressing Home Button and than application icon, instead of resuming and showing previous screen, application shows splash screen and main screen of application. It is like complete restart of application but I found that previous functions/events are still working (for example I have events based on file download and they were not interrupted).

I did not have such situation before with this app and sometimes application behave normally (resuming to place it should). There is no any special message in console.

There was other person with the same issue, so I suppose it is a bug:

   I don't think this is limited to Android 5.1. I'm seeing this on Android 4.4 and lower also.</li>
