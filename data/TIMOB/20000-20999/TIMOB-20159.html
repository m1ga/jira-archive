<h3>Description</h3>

Right now we have a single PR builder for Windows SDK and it runs the 8.1 build and unit tests. We should have it build for both Windows 8.1 and 10 and run those unit tests.

Some possible solutions:
- Generate a second PR builder copy of the first that runs 10 and unit test
- Make the existing PR builder more like our master build where it farms out to special 8.1 and 10.0 build jobs as a steps. Not sure if these jobs would get the code from the PR branches/refs on fetch without some changes, though.
