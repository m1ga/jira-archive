<h3>Description</h3>

We currently require that the Windows Phone 8.1 tooling is installed for us to be able to get the emulator listing. We should support Windows 10 universal apps without requiring the user to also install the Windows 8.1 tooling.

We'll need alternate ways to get the list of emulators for Windows 10, rather than using Windows Phone 8.1 AppDeployCmd.exe. I believe we can already do so using our own custom wptool.exe.

   I searched for "Apps & Features" in my settings, sorted by size, chose VS2015, Modify. Then I unchecked the Windows 8.1 entries/tooling and removed all my 8.1 SDK/tooling. Once done, I tested the code manually (by going into windowslib and running <code>npm run-script test-wptool</code> and <code>npm run-script test-windowsphone</code> and adding some console.log statements into those tests).
   
   Basically, we should now support Windows 10 detection/tooling without requiring the user _also_ have 8.1.
   
   Once the PR is merged I'll need to publish to npm and then merge into titanium_mobile.</li>

   [~kota] [~cwilliams] [~gmathews] Could windowslib in 5_3_X get updated to the latest version please, currently it is at 0.3.1 as 5_3_X was branched from 5_2_X. 
   
   Also, from my initial testing using an SDK from master branch I am unable to build a project to device, I get the error <code>Failed to conect to emulator</code>, however when running <code>npm run test-device</code> in windowslib the test suite is successful, once 5_3_X has an updated windowslib I will look into this further and create the tickets as needed.</li>
