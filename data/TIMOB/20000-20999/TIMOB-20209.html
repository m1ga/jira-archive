<h3>Description</h3>

Hello, I am trying to load the '.docx' file using the documentViewer API and it's not working as  expected.

According to the docs, we can load the '.doc' file using this API and it's working fine with it. 
[<a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#</a>!/api/Titanium.UI.iOS.DocumentViewer]

Please let me know if it can be available for the following:
 - iOS version :- iOS 7 and above.
 - Appcelerator's SDK version :- 4.0.0 and above.

Can you please suggest how to exhibit the same functionality for the docx file using the documentViewer API ?

I have also attached the POC.

   Please test above with new .doc file in attachments (sample.doc). I am not able to open the this file using the documentViewer API. This file is of format Word 97 (.doc) Document.
   
   
   I am using the 5.1.1GA SDK and 5.1.0 CLI version as suggested.

   After investigating the issue , it seems the problem is native. In our SDK all we do is synthesize the arguments and pass them to the delegate. It seems to wok with all other .doc files that are not exported from word 97. After doing some more digging it seems that Apple have the same issue with more of their software when it comes to reading .doc file that are Microsoft 97-2004. It appears to be an issue with Email attachments and Page app. A solution would be to simply put all the context of the so doc file and move it to a newer version of MS Word. 
   
   I would have suggested to also add the file to an online doc [viewer](<a href="http://www.viewdocsonline.com)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.viewdocsonline.com)</a> and then add the link to our webView. However it seems not even onlineDocs will read the file format. </li>
