   Hello, For push notification in Android Marshmallow use Titanium SDK 6.0.0.v20151228134127. Run "ti sdk install -b master -d" to install the SDK.
   
   See the attachments. If you want an image to show with your push notification you need to put the image in "platform/android/res/values". Now after building the app when you send the push notification through appceelartor platform in icons section write the name of the image. The notification will arrive with the image you choose. Thanks.</li>

   Thanks Sharif for the help. I had tried this solution. But still not able to see the much clear App Icon. I had tried some different image for Push Notification (Just for testing purpose). What I've found is, it is showing the image, but not that clear as it should be. The image looks much white, though it is originally black. I've attached the respective image & screenshot for more clearance.

   I am facing the same issue on Marshmallow. On other OS the push notification is working fine, but on Android Marshmallow the icon for Android push notification appeared white in color. Please help me to solve this issue.</li>

   From Lollipop (material design) onwards the notification icons are applied on white. The assets should be updated accordingly. This is assets issue, not an issue on titanium.
