<h3>Description</h3>

Investigate crash analysis library for Windows Store/Phone, equivalent for Crittercism, KSCrash and so on.

per TIMOB-20150

{quote}
To sum things up, the sdk team has decided to use these 2 libraries KSCrash and ACRA for iOS and Android respectively. The next step is to determine in detail the protocol for these libs with the crash-server endpoint. So PEM team please take a look at above comments and proposal, and we can determine how to move forward in replacing the crittercism client lib.

Things to note and consider:
1. do we need to achieve cross-platform parity in the data posted at client? or let the crash-server process each platform's unique crash report and insert accordingly to the database?
2. additional information to append to the data, such as app guid or key.
3. windows platform will be considered at a later phase, with priority placed on iOS and Android.
4. Possibility to fork these 2 repos if in depth modifications are required.

   I was spending an hour on this, but ends up finding few commercial services for it. 
   
   - HockeyApp - [HockeyApp](<a href="http://support.hockeyapp.net/kb/client-integration-windows-and-windows-phone/hockeyapp-for-windows-store-apps-and-windows-phone-store-apps)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://support.hockeyapp.net/kb/client-integration-windows-and-windows-phone/hockeyapp-for-windows-store-apps-and-windows-phone-store-apps)</a> provides distribution-integration like TestFlight, and it includes Crash Reports. Seems like it's a Windows RT components that can be used from C++/CX.
   - Crittercism - [Crittercism](<a href="http://docs.crittercism.com/windows/windows.html#requirements)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.crittercism.com/windows/windows.html#requirements)</a> supports Windows Phone Store Apps, but it's for .NET apps. (Titanium for Windows is C++/CX app).
   - Splunk MINT - [Splunk MINT](<a href="http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Mint/latest/ProductOverview/Documentation)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Mint/latest/ProductOverview/Documentation)</a> once did support Windows Phone, but not any more for now.
