<h3>Description</h3>

As part of the major release 6.0.0, we should set the minimum Xcode version from 6.4 to 7.2 and remove the <code>IS_XCODE_6</code> macros to cleanup the code base.

   [~bimmel] Probably need to document somewhere when 6.0.0 is released, that iOS8 is the minimum requirement, and no longer support any versions earlier than 8.0.</li>

   Seriously?
   
   There is no break out to show the percentage of 7.x iOS users.  This could be a large number of that 7% judging by previous drop down staggers of iOS.
   
   Given that iOS 7 was the break from the old to the new UI wise - this is not the same as dropping pre iOS 7.  Can you show the breakdowns of iOS 7 users yourself?  Or value attributed to the likely increase in Enterprise customer usage of iOS 7?
   
   This should be led by Apple dropping support.  Not a hopeful wish.  Whilst I strongly encourage any attempts to clean the code base - it should not be done based on overview usage data with no real relation to actual usage.
   
   If you could show me the take up based by all the Appcelerator apps currently available and further by industry type to back this up then there is a solid base for the suggestion.  However without this I believe this is a rush to judgement.</li>

   I apologise for the misunderstanding here. Renaming the title to "Setting Xcode 7.0 as minimum requirement for titanium build".
   We are not saying we won't support iOS7 and less. we will support whichever target iOS version Xcode 7 and above can build to.

   I updated the description to clarify the reason for this ticket. Hopefully it's clear now.

   [~bimmel] Which docs need to updated for this? I can also think of the [compatibility matrix](<a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#</a>!/guide/Titanium_Compatibility_Matrix-section-29004837_TitaniumCompatibilityMatrix-Xcode).</li>
<li>(deactived) Brian Immel 2016-02-01

   [~hans123] & [~cng], I think the following documents will need to be updated when 6.0 comes:
   <h4><a href="https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides2/Configuring+XCode+inside+Studio" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides2/Configuring+XCode+inside+Studio</a></h4>
   <h4><a href="https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides2/Installing+the+iOS+SDK#InstallingtheiOSSDK-Xcode" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides2/Installing+the+iOS+SDK#InstallingtheiOSSDK-Xcode</a></h4>
   <h4><a href="https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides2/Titanium+Compatibility+Matrix#TitaniumCompatibilityMatrix-Xcode" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides2/Titanium+Compatibility+Matrix#TitaniumCompatibilityMatrix-Xcode</a></h4>
   
   Prior to this release, we'll need to create a TIDOC ticket listing these pages and the changes needed as mentioned in this ticket.</li>
<li>Hans Knöchel 2016-02-11

   Good point Brian! I can create a ticket for you covering the links regarding to Xcode compatibility. Question: When you update the Wiki, will it automatically be published "live"? I see the possible problem, that if we update it the next weeks and the release is months away, people will struggle about it.</li>
<li>(deactived) Brian Immel 2016-02-11

   [~hans123], I won't be able to post that info until the changes comes to pass. I can write the changes in a stub page and then copy the info over when the time comes but like you pointed out, that won't be for a while and I would hate to confuse our users with information they cannot use.
   
   I'll have to set up a reminder to make those changes. If only Jira tickets had a reminder function....</li>
