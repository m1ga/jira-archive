		"description": "The current plan in 5.2 for storyboard support for launch images is great (especially since the iPad Pro requires it).  However, we should not expect a Ti user to have to use XCode to do this.  We should make it easier to support storyboard launch images without the Ti user having to use XCode.  Whether that is packaging the provided image in to a storyboard we maintain, or some other way, we can discuss that here in this jira.\r\n\r\nSpecifically:  Users want to keep existing functionality where they provide an appropriately sized splash screen image (e.g. Default.png) and it will show on the appropriate device.",

					"body": "This was briefly discussed during the implementation of launchScreen.storyboard support. It is difficult not to break behavior and continue using splash images. \r\nh4. A short explanation would be:\r\n1. it is not possible to distinguish between shorter screens and longer screens on the iPhone devices during ti build (Xcode project creation phase)\r\n2. it is not possible to distinguish between landscape and portrait for iPad devices during ti build (Xcode project creation phase).\r\n3. Apple doesn't advise the use of a static image if using launchScreen.storyboard. (and may eventually remove support for static splash screens)\r\nBecause of 1 and 2, forcefully using the splash images will end up them being stretched out of proportion.\r\n\r\nh4. Conclusion:\r\nUse the property <enable-launch-screen-storyboard> to decide between using splash screens or launch screen for now.\r\nThere is no way to reuse current splash screens into launch screen. We have to devise some method such as app designer to create launchScreen.storyboard without ti devs having to access Xcode.\r\n",
