<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Issue Description</h4>

There is no way to see log statements from Watch code. If users write anything in watch code in log statements it doesn't show on appcelerator studio log as well as it doesnt show on xcode log. It makes it difficult to debug the application.

   For watch simulators, Titanium will tail the watch sim's system.log, but the messages are intermingled with the Titanium app's logs. Obviously the watch app would need to <code>NSLog()</code> some message to be seen in the log. No idea how to do this on an Apple Watch device. I don't have a watch device to test, but I could get one, though I don't think I'm the right person to implement it.</li>
