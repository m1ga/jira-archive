From the stack trace it seems that during a view removal, this incident happened. There are many places in the code where we have added and removed view. As there is no definite place defined in the log and nor we have the test case, we went through the framework code and saw that there is no null handling inside the method as TiProxy.m --> krollObjectForBridge function can return nil.\r\n\r\nAgain, in the javascript code, if we do something like:\r\n\r\n{code:java}\r\nwindow.remove(null);\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nWe too can see that TiViewProxy remove is called, but the application does not crash due to ENSURE_ARGS check I guess. Hence does it mean that the issue is occurring due to scenario where the UI has been garbage collected but not set to null for which it is trying to clean it.\r\n\r\nAlso this issue does not occur everyday, rather 3-5 times a week across several iOS devices with majorly running iOS 9. We do not have a test case, we only get the same stack trace from the dashboard.",

					"body": "Yes, we agree that the application is required to be updated to the latest Appcelerator SDK (5.1.2.GA at the moment) and built using the latest XCode 7.x. The reason for raising the JIRA is to check as to how and when this exception can occur. Also, we are aware that window remove API will accept UIView object, but the purpose of passing NULL was to confirm that the SDK can handle null scenario and it did not crash. It is confirmed that even if we pass NULL, the application  did not crash (release mode), but the same remove API caused the crash (in release mode in production), which means that the application did not pass null, rather a UIView object, which somehow seems to be already removed. (may be a timing issue?)",
