   Seems to be supported, just not documented:
   <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile_windows/blob/7a957a20c9085cd17e7f6b1dfe0e3d439e18f68f/Source/TitaniumKit/src/UI/OpenWindowParams.cpp#L42" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile_windows/blob/7a957a20c9085cd17e7f6b1dfe0e3d439e18f68f/Source/TitaniumKit/src/UI/OpenWindowParams.cpp#L42</a></li>

   See TIDOC-2430</li>

   We do support this already, correct? If I recall there's some limitations to it on 8.1 versus 10 or phone versus desktop apps? Or am I thinking of "fullscreen"?</li>

   Also to note, the screenshots they showed in the PPT appear to be mostly just normal views/windows that take up the full screen and have a X button/image at upper right to close it. No reason they couldn't just do that.
   
   I do see one popup that appears to just be informational and  could likely be achieved with an AlertDialog or OptionDialog.
   
   The first example appears to just be a sort of image overlay on top of the view to point out how to use the app's main screen? I'm not sure how that'd typically be implemented, maybe using a view position properly containing an image with the fancy custom font and see transparency? How do they do it on the other platforms?</li>

   I'm not quite sure what do you need from "modal" Window. I mean all Ti.UI.Window on Windows phones are already modal  in the sense of description of the "modal Window" from Titanium API doc because only one Window is allowed to be shown at a time on phone devices.
   
   {quote}
   In the user interface, a modal window is a window that blocks the main application UI until the modal window is dismissed. A modal window requires the user to interact with it to resume the normal flow of the application
   {quote}
   
    If you need modal dialog you can use AlertDialog or OptionDialog. If you need more complex layout you can still use Window.open which is always shown on top of the app until it's dismissed by (<code>Window.close()</code>).

   Yes, they really should dive into the actual code for the Android/iOS version and determine what *actual* APIs are used.</li>
