		"description": "Hi,\r\n\r\nWe get crash logs from appcelerator dashboard but the stack trace mainly provide function call to native files. There is no way to map them back to the Javascript code for which the crash had occurred. This gets very difficult where in the native API which caused the crash is called from multiple places in the Javascript code.\r\n\r\nIf we can also get it know as to which call in Javascript (file and line number) caused the issue, then it will be of great help to the community and developers, otherwise the current native stack trace seems to provide a small help to the defect fixing process.",
