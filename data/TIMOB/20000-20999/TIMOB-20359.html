   [~heggern] Can you please provide more infos? Does it only happen on the device or the simulator? Which iOS do you test with? The attached logs are studio logs, no app logs, so we cannot get much information from there.</li>

   It happens both on the device (several devices) and on the simulator.
   Tested with iOS 9.2. 
   
   All splash screens are present and with the correct file name.</li>

   Please attach an example project which we can run. The <code>Ti.Platform.displayCaps</code> properties are definitely working and haven't been touched for years. Also I'm not sure how the splashscreen related to the above mentioned properties. Please give us some more context. AND: Does everyting work in 5.1.2.GA?</li>

   Hi. 
   
   I don't its something wrong with the platform width. When building with 5.2.0 I don't get the iPhone 6 resolution, but the iPhone 5 resolution. It looks just like the app is in a zoom view. 
   
   Most likely the 5.2.0 build ignores the splash file for iPhone 6. Or looking for another name </li>

   I tested the issue with the latest 5_2_X branch and iOS 8.3, 8.4, 9.0 and 9.2. It is not reproducible, so we are closing this issue for now. If you have a reproducible test case, feel free to comment and we will take a closer look again.</li>

   Commented above just as you answered. Your issue is (very) known to be caused by invalid file names / dimensions of your splash screens. Please create an empty project and compare the sizes and file names with your ones and export the splash screens again to make your its not caused by an alpha channel / file format issue.</li>
