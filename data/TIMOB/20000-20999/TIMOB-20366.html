<h3>Description</h3>

No matter which keyboard I define only the default keyboard shows on Android and iOS devices. 
Soft keyboard never shows on iOS simulator and Genymotion Emulator.
I enclose the console output.
The problem may be caused by this error that shows in the console output: [Error: Module version mismatch. Expected 46, got 14.]
I have tried everything I can possibly think of but as it seems without positive result. I attach a file holding the console output from a iOS simulator run as well as the very simple codebase.

   Does <code>Ti.UI.KEYBOARD_NUMBER_PAD</code> work? If so, the PR of [~apetkov] needs to be revisited. Also make sure you use Titanium Mobile 5.2.0 or later for <code>Ti.UI.KEYBOARD_TYPE_NUMBER_PAD</code>, all versions before use <code>Ti.UI.KEYBOARD_NUMBER_PAD</code>.</li>

   Update: Both support team and reporter tested using Titanium Mobile 5.x which does not support <code>Ti.UI.KEYBOARD_TYPE_NUMBER_PAD</code>, yet. Anyway, we need to update [the docs](<a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#</a>!/api/Titanium.UI-property-KEYBOARD_TYPE_NUMBER_PAD), which currently say, that the constant is already available in Titanium Mobile 0.8. [~apetkov] please fix. /cc [~cng], the docs update would make sense for 5_2_X</li>

   Whether I use "Ti.UI.KEYBOARD_NUMBER_PAD" or "Ti.UI.KEYBOARD_TYPE_NUMBER_PAD" I get the same result. Only the Default keyboard is showing on devices and no soft keyboard is shown on the iOS simulator and the Genymotion emulator (Titanium SDK: 5.1.2.GA).

   I just took the time and revalidated it myself. Test code:
   <code><pre>
   var win = Ti.UI.createWindow({
     backgroundColor : "#fff"
   });
   
   var field = Ti.UI.createTextField({
   	keyboardType: Ti.UI.KEYBOARD_NUMBER_PAD, // works in all versions, deprecated in 5.2.x
   	width: 300,
   	height: 40,
   	backgroundColor: "#ccc"
   });
   
   win.add(field);
   win.open();
   </pre></code>
   
   Result (correct): <a href="http://abload.de/img/simulatorscreenshot085pum3.png" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://abload.de/img/simulatorscreenshot085pum3.png</a>

   I tested your Classic example and it worked on iOS devices as you state. But as you can see from the files I included in the Bug report I tested in Alloy. Just like you I just defined a text field and the keyboard to use with no additional code. This still does not work.

   [~fmiao] Do we hardcode any keyboard related constants in Alloy? Looks suspicious!</li>
<li>Feon Sua Xin Miao 2016-02-08

   [~john@marott.dk], the test app you attached need to be modified: 
   <code><pre>
   "#TextField_1": {
   	"width": "67.60%",
   	"height": "4.90%",
   	"borderRadius": "10",
   	"borderColor": "#E5E5E5",
   	"borderWidth": "1",
   	"left": "19.60%",
   	"top": "27.31%",
   	"hintText": "Type something",
   	"keyboardType": Titanium.UI.KEYBOARD_DECIMAL_PAD // &lt;----- like in classic, this should not be enclosed with quotes.
   }
   </pre></code></li>
<li>John Marott 2016-02-08

   You are absolutely right. Without quotes it works like it should. I really thought that I had tested without quotes. Now I realize that the problem can be referred back to the Designer. The Designer seems to put quotes around everything so even if I edit the TSS file without quotes around keyboard constants,  as soon as I make changes using the Designer the Designer will put quotes right back. This made me believe that the keyboard constants should be enclosed in quotes.
   
   Sorry for the inconvenience and thank you so much for your efforts.
