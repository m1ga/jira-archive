<h3>Description</h3>

With CLI-827 we resolved the issue that after switching NodeJS (API) version NodeJS dependencies that use native extensions no longer work.

However, we also have NodeJS dependencies in the SDK. So we need to rebuild those as well.

   There is only one native module in the Titanium SDK and that's node-ios-device. I constantly keep that up-to-date as soon as the Node module API version changes.
   
   The error in Stack Overflow was related to sqlite3 which was only in Titanium SDK 5.0.x. It was removed in 5.1.0. So, this issue isn't an issue.</li>

   OK, I thought we had sqlite3 in older versions as well and since we support 3.5+ that would be a problem. But in that case people can just use 5.1 instead of 5.0</li>
