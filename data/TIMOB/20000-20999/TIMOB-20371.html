<h3>Description</h3>

As organizations are more frequently creating more than one application for their users (both internal and external), eliminating the need for logging into each application provides a much better overall experience to the end user.

Titanium should be updated to make it easy to implement cross app (same device) SSO using the secured storage options for each platform. This would provide an abstracted singular API, and enforce best practice around storing credentials on the device. 

This feature would not perform the authentication to the system of record, but simply provide the mechanism for storing and retrieving the user session securely on the device for access from multiple apps.

*Use Cases*
<code><pre>
As an app developer, I want to enable authentication between multiple applications on the same device, eliminating the need for users to sign in multiple times.
</pre></code>

The above use case is from the developer perspective, providing the shared library as part of APS Native SDK, enables a consistent controlled experience for single sign-on, but does not implement the authentication itself.

And from the end user perspective:

<code><pre>
As a user, i want to be able to login to one application and have my session persisted across multiple apps belonging to and developed by a single organization
</pre></code>
