   This PR improves response rate of <code>Ti.UI.Button</code> click event significantly. It looks like the issue is because Xaml <code>Tapped</code> event is not so responsive, and on the Button we have <code>Click</code> event which always works better.
   
   For other components, unfortunately, from what I observed I noticed that Xaml controls's <code>Tapped</code> event is not so responsive and it loses some user input even on pure native app. So I don't have anything to do with it...

   Verified as fixed, using <code>Click</code> proves to be much more responsive, tested 60 taps on both 8.1 & 10.0 windows phone devices and every tap was registered.
   
   Tested on: 
   Windows 10 Pro 
   Windows Phone 10.0 & 8.1 (Microsoft Lumia 640 LTE) 
   Appc Studio: 4.6.0.201604141457
   Ti SDK: 5.3.0.v20160414094426
   Appc NPM: 4.2.5-1 
   Appc Core: 5.3.0-12 
   Node: v4.4.2

   [~kota]  Is it possible we need to explore a "lower-level" event than Tapped to improve response? According to the MS docs, Tapped is a higher-level event that may combine multiple lower events. Maybe we need to investigate using PointerPressed?</li>
