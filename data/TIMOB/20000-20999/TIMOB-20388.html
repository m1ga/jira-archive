<h3>Description</h3>

I have one ScrollableView. Inside this I have one view whose width is 90% height is Ti.UI.SIZE. Scrollable view height is also set to Ti.UI.SIZE. Now issue is underlaying view's width and height is taking the entire screen. But if I explicitly assign a height say 100dip to ScrollableView then there is no issue. But I can't set height as the content of the view is not fixed. This is happening only in Android. I tested in android 5.0.0. In iOS it is working as expected. We have project road blocks due to this. So can you please help us on this.

   Are you ever going to get this fixed? It's really ridiculous you can't fix one of the most essential layout properties for a ScrollableView.. Can't even use it in an application as it currently is!</li>

   I have the same problem, in IOS work as expected but in Andorid with SDK 5.2.2.GA is still the bug and I have to set a specific height.</li>
