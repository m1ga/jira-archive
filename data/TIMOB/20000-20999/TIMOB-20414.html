<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>How can we check from our app that the Android device is Rooted. </h4>
So application is not able to start.

I had some Google, that it is possibel to check it in android native code, but not possibel through appcelerator code.
Other alternative is android Module.

But i am suggesting  to appcelerator to  add some methods and propery. 
to make it easy.

I know it is vary twisty topic. if it is possible  make it work
Thanx and Best of luck

   Hello, Thank you for dropping this idea to add in out platform. In Android there is a method isDeviceRooted(), Which will check if the device is rooted or not. If you want to use this you need to develop a module for this. You need to understand that it is a time-consuming process of adding new features in the platform. Besides this request has to pass the approvals before development. We will let you know if and when it will be available. Thanks.</li>

   Hi Sharif,
   
   Thank you for give me a reply , and i am also aware of the input required to implement this functionality, please take as much as your time. By the way i found the alternative solution to know that the device is rooted or jailbreak in android and ios.
   
   There is a existing property to be added in tiapp.xml, which will not able to run the app on rooted or jailbreak devices.
   
   @Fokke  helps me to make this possible.
   
   [<a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#</a>!/guide/tiapp.xml_and_timodule.xml_Reference-section-29004921_tiapp.xmlandtimodule.xmlReference-ApplicationProperties]
   
   But my idea is for adding the method for making  the app secure and venerable from threats.
   
   My only suggestion is to you to add the method, or application level property, which may be helpful to other also for security measure in their app.
