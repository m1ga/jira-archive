If you want to use this you need to develop a module for this. You need to understand that it is a time-consuming process of adding new features in the platform. Besides this request has to pass the approvals before development. We will let you know if and when it will be available. Thanks.",

					"body": "Hi Sharif,\r\n\r\nThank you for give me a reply , and i am also aware of the input required to implement this functionality, please take as much as your time. By the way i found the alternative solution to know that the device is rooted or jailbreak in android and ios.\r\n\r\nThere is a existing property to be added in tiapp.xml, which will not able to run the app on rooted or jailbreak devices.\r\n\r\n@Fokke  helps me to make this possible.\r\n\r\n[http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#!/guide/tiapp.xml_and_timodule.xml_Reference-section-29004921_tiapp.xmlandtimodule.xmlReference-ApplicationProperties]\r\n\r\nBut my idea is for adding the method for making  the app secure and venerable from threats.\r\n\r\nMy only suggestion is to you to add the method, or application level property, which may be helpful to other also for security measure in their app.\r\n",
