<h3>Description</h3>

To support Hyperloop modules, developers need to access common Ti-utilities like we already do with <code>TiApp</code>. Common used classes:
- TiUtils
- WebColor
- WebFont

Problem to discuss is also: What do we do for existing modules that want to be migrated to Hyperloop? They often rely on existing proxies (although not recommended).

   From yesterday's discussion with [~penrique]: Because we want to replace the Ti-core with Hyperloop sooner than later, we should rewrite the common built-in classes needed for modules using Hyperloop instead of exposing proxies to Hyperloop. So renaming this ticket to "Hyperloop: Expose built-in classes and utilities". /cc [~ingo]</li>

   Update here: Got some important builtins in place (utils, webcolor, webfont). We need to find a good place for those to be accessible without copying them over everytime. I think of [this directory](<a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/hyperloop.next/tree/master/metabase/ios/templates/builtins)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/hyperloop.next/tree/master/metabase/ios/templates/builtins)</a> but without further metabase-processing, just make it possible to use it with <code>require("builtins/utils")</code> etc.</li>

   Pushed the current utilities to <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/hyperloop-utilities" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/hyperloop-utilities</a>, where we plan to manage all (both open-source and company-provided) utilities. We may think of packaging some of them into the hyperloop-module-template as well, but for now, developers are able to grab the utilities they need and thats cool!</li>

   Changing issue-type to <code>Story</code>, since there is not much to test, yet.</li>
