<h3>Description</h3>

In order to make Hyperloop modules distributable (TIMOB-20379) on the marketplace / registry, we need to a) encrypt the source code and b) hook the module licensing into the build process.

I have no idea how that is done currently, but it looks like it's part of the upload process at the marketplace. Please feel free to discuss here!

   I am leading the development effort of a new encryption process (TIMOB-20351) that will make all of our wildest dreams come true. [~jhaynie], [~cng], and [~emerriman] have all raised their hands to be apart of this initiative in some capacity.</li>
