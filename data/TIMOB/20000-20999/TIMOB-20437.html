<h3>Description</h3>

I have an app that runs fine in the simulator. But when I try to build and run on a recognized device, nothing happens. the console is empty etc. It was only through trying to start it through the command line that i received the error that the WWDR certificate was missing (one was installed, but had expired).

It would be great to have an error message.
