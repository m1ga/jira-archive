For all static includes, i.e. require(\"lodash\") or require(\"../mylib\"), you could easily map and change the requires to the correct path before packaging the app.\r\n\r\nDynamic requires, i.e. require(myvar + \"mylib\") would require a bit more effort such as creating a function that could lookup the desired library at runtime and use that with the relative folder to find it in a list of libraries in the app (assuming the list was generated at compile time.)\r\n\r\nYou could also look in the package.json files at compile time to see if there is a main referenced.  Support for index.js could also be added at compile time.\r\n\r\nI've tried a few of the methods such as ti-commonjs which look for things at runtime, but the performance hit from those was far too great.",

Yes, ideally, the change would go into the SDK but I am able to get a working solution by altering just Alloy.   My reasoning for the change is I often want to use nodejs packages in Titanium without having to modify them to get them to work.  Also, it is nice to be able to use the same coding styles across Titanium/Alloy and Node.js.  I really blame it all on you guys anyway, as I probably wouldn't be nearly as deep into Node.js if it wasn't for Appccelerator!",

I actually think our Windows implementation does follow the NodeJS specs btw.\r\n\r\nI get requests to support NodeJS require every week. A great example is how we have to modify our Alloy built-in moment.js every time we update it in order for it to be able to find its localisations. It's libraries like these that people die to use in Alloy.\r\n\r\nThis should be seen entirely separate from the question if we should provide shims for NodeJS APIs. It's first-most about being able to use libraries distributed via NPM. Of course once that works, people can choose to load in libraries that shim {{process}}, {{os}}, {{path}} etc themselves. We might not actually need to provide that ourselves.",
