   Hey there, is it possible that you included the module (and plugin), but didn't have any hyperloop-code in your project? That may be caused by TIMOB-20274. I would like you to test the [hyperloop-1.1.1](<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/xv6ith72m0jfkf7/hyperloop-1.1.1.zip?dl=0)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.dropbox.com/s/xv6ith72m0jfkf7/hyperloop-1.1.1.zip?dl=0)</a> prerelease that may solve this issue as well. If not, please attach further infos as full trace-log and the example project. Thanks!</li>

   As I mentioned here AC-703, it doesn't even compile app when there is no HL code. When there is HL code, console stops working right after simulator is launched. I will try the prerelease and update you shortly. Thanks!</li>

   I tried hyperloop-1.1.1, It is still the same no logs as soon simulator is launched. Attached [build_iphone.log](<a href="https://db.tt/fPn11wid)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://db.tt/fPn11wid)</a> for your reference.</li>

   Might be fixed by <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/7875." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/7875.</a> [~mano_mykingdom], can you confirm that?</li>
<li>Manojkumar Murugesan 2016-03-28

   Should I build the SDK from that pull request to test this?</li>
<li>Hans Knöchel 2016-03-28

   Either that, or just download the latest master from builds.appcelerator.com and replace the file there. Or we need to wait until the PR is merged.</li>

   [~hansknoechel] I tried with latest code on master (5.4.0) with hyperloop 1.1.2, issue is fixed.</li>
