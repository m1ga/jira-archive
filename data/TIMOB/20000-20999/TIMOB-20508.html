<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>I am working on an iOS application with an enterprise license but after deploying the app to our website it doesnâ€™t seem to work</h4>

Gives an error that app cannot be downloaded at this time

I have found these types of errors to work with with xcode but with appcelerator this is not the case

When I choose an Adhoc option this seems to work. I suspect this is a proviosioning issue. My ios license is Enterprise though so I am not sure why I need to use the adhoc license?

   Hello, you will need a distribution provisioning profile for both ad hoc and in house distribution. For your case, this is in house distribution. Here is the guide to [distributing iOS app](<a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#</a>!/guide/Distributing_iOS_apps-section-27595277_DistributingiOSapps-Distributeandinstallyouradhocapplication) in different ways. Could you point out the what seems to be troubling you.  Thanks.</li>

   When deploying choosing the Adhoc provisioning profile the app can be downloaded but everyone listed on the device list but if I choose a normal enterprise they get an error the app cannot be downloaded at this time and to try later. </li>
