I only care to mention two of the most important reason to not put the dependency support matrix in the Titanium CLI:\r\n\r\n1. Common sense. The build command is in the SDK. The build options and flags are in the SDK. The validation is in the SDK. The supported/required dependencies will remain in the SDK.\r\n\r\n2. Part of the beauty of how we package SDK releases is the dependencies are locked down and the release is tested and certified. If you change the supported dependencies, we can no longer certify a release. You are inevitably increasing the surface area.\r\n\r\nThe new Titanium build is a very radical departure from what we have today. This \"feature\" will be pointless in the new design.",
