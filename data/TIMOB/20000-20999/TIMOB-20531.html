<h3>Description</h3>

Running the appc login command returns "5.2.0".

Attempting to run appc ti build afterward returns "Appcelerator Login required to continue ..."

As a result our entire CI process is at a halt.

   Hmmm....  Are you in a VPC environment? I think I may understand the issue if so. If you are on a VPC, please try <code>--vpc-env</code> in place of <code>-v</code>. </li>

   We had to do that AND re-install the CLI, but finally got it working.
   
   What we're seeing now is that it's defaulting to iOS SDK 8.4, and I'm having to explicitly set the -I 9.2 flag on our build commands.</li>

   [~rashley] Thanks. We have been struggling with this issue trying to reproduce in order to resolve it. If you learn anything that would be valuable please let us know. I will request that the ticket is moved to TIMOB component in JIRA for further investigation by the developer team.</li>

   Eric, are you struggling with the login issue or the iOS SDK version issue?
   
   Have you been able to reproduce it?
   
   I opened a ticket on the SDK issue on support.appcelerator.com. They advised removing and re-installing all our versions of Xcode, which I did, but it's still defaulting to 8.4</li>

   Hi [~rashley] Just saw this discussion. Not sure this will help but, I'm assuming you have multiple versions of Xcode installed?
   if you do this command *appc info*, you should see something like this (this is on my local machine)
   <code><pre>
   Xcode
     7.3 (build 7D152p)
       Install Location          = /Applications/Xcode-beta.app/Contents/Developer
       iOS SDKs                  = 9.3
       iOS Simulators            = 9.3
       Watch SDKs                = 2.2
       Watch Simulators          = 2.2
       Supported by TiSDK 5.2.1  = yes
       EULA Accepted             = yes
       Teams                     = none
     7.2.1 (build 7C1002)
       Install Location          = /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
       iOS SDKs                  = 9.2
       iOS Simulators            = 9.2
       Watch SDKs                = 2.1
       Watch Simulators          = 2.1
       Supported by TiSDK 5.2.1  = yes
       EULA Accepted             = yes
       Teams                     = WP4952RUHJ Appcelerator, Inc. - Company/Organization (active)
                                 = 8E7GRG5DDM Chee Ng - Individual (active)
     6.4 (build 6E35b) - Xcode default
       Install Location          = /Applications/Xcode.6.4.app/Contents/Developer
       iOS SDKs                  = 8.4
       iOS Simulators            = 8.4
       Watch SDKs                = 1.0
       Watch Simulators          = 1.0
       Supported by TiSDK 5.2.1  = yes
       EULA Accepted             = yes
       Teams                     = none
   </pre></code>
   Notices the *Xcode default* is currently pointed at 6.4 (that supports iOS 8.4)
   You want to change that to point to Xcode 7.2.1 (or in your case it maybe Xcode 7.2)
   You do so by executing this command *sudo xcode-select --switch /Applications/Xcode.app*
   If you run *appc info* again you can verify that the change took effect
   and when you run *appc run* you won't need that flag *-I 9.2*
   
   hope that helps.</li>

   Tried that already.
   My appc info give me:
   
   <code><pre>
   7.2 (build 7C68) - Xcode default
       Install Location          = /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
       iOS SDKs                  = 9.2
       iOS Simulators            = 9.2
       Watch SDKs                = 2.1
       Watch Simulators          = 2.1
       Supported by TiSDK 5.2.0.GA = yes
       EULA Accepted             = yes
       Teams                     = V99J3K45A6 Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation - Company/Organization (active)
                                 = T5533WY4HV Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation (Ent) - In-House (active)
                                 = Y8AG8BSN4L Ryan Ashley - Individual (active)
     6.4 (build 6E35b)
       Install Location          = /Applications/Xcode_6.4.app/Contents/Developer
       iOS SDKs                  = 8.4
       iOS Simulators            = 8.4
       Watch SDKs                = 1.0
       Watch Simulators          = 1.0
       Supported by TiSDK 5.2.0.GA = yes
       EULA Accepted             = yes
       Teams                     = V99J3K45A6 Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation - Company/Organization (active)
                                 = T5533WY4HV Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation (Ent) - In-House (active)
   </pre></code>
   
   So as you can see 7.2 IS set as the default, but it still builds on 8.4.</li>
