<h3>Description</h3>

One of the problems when writing Hyperloop code is, that you need to run the project to be able to test your code integrity. Xcode and Eclipse offer native developers the chance to validate code by using autocomplete to speed-up the development.

While debugging and breakpoints could be tricky, the autocompletion *could* be easier using the existing metabase. The problem there is, that the metabase is compiled conditionally, so new native wrappers are only generated as soon as the code is compiled again. That's why it wouldn't be available for code completion. 

I know we were talking about how Hyperloop is only for advanced users, but that shouldn't be a reason to skip the need of this functionality. 

P.S.: We may move this ticket to TISTUD later.
