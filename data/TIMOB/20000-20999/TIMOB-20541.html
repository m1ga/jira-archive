<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Steps to Reproduce</h4>
1) Upgrade appcelerator and SDK to SDK 5.2
2) build your app


<h4>Actual Result</h4>
[INFO] : Optimizing .plist and .png files
[INFO] : Invoking xcodebuild
[ERROR] : * BUILD FAILED **
[ERROR] : The following build commands failed:
[ERROR] : Ld build/Intermediates/Game.build/Debug-iphoneos/Game.build/Objects-normal/armv7/Game normal armv7
[ERROR] : Ld build/Intermediates/Game.build/Debug-iphoneos/Game.build/Objects-normal/arm64/Game normal arm64
[ERROR] : (2 failures)

<h4>Expected Result</h4>
This should not appear. Before doing the upgrade the application was building fine. I have checked all other modules, and they do not cause build to fail, only the Facebook module does.

   Yep! There are lots of us affected by this!!!
   
   For the time being, I seem to be able to build using SDK 4.0.0RC5 on Mac / iOS
   
   ...on Android however, it builds just fine but the moment you actually call fb.authorize() the application hangs - again, works using 4.1.0 (Built on Windows)
   
   (...it may well work on other 4.x SDK releases but I can only say about the 2 I have used!)
   
   Thanks!

   Robin, I have not tried yet but are you able to build it on an iphone running ios9 since it is a 32bit module? 
   
   Probably the reason why the older SDK works is because they do not require the modules to be 64 bit. </li>
<li>Samie 2016-03-08

   (Apple will reject any app to the App Store running 32 bit modules)</li>
<li>Robin Williams 2016-03-08

   Sorry, I only have devices running 7.x (iPhone 4) & 8.x (iPad Mini)
   
   It definitely works on the iP4 / 7.x using SDK 4.0.0 RC5 :)
   
   I can't test the iPad yet as it's playing up! ;)</li>

   Hello, 
   
   I just tested the facebook module Version 5.0.1 in SDK 5.2.0.GA. The sample code in the module example is working as expected. I used the sample example comes with the module which should be in .../Users/..../Library/Application Support/Titanium/modules/iphone/facebook/5.0.1/example. I used the sample code and logged in through "Custome Log In". The app did not crash and there is no error in the console. See the attachment. Use facebook module version "5.0.1". To check which module has 64bit support try running "ti-64" in project terminal. 
   
   Thanks.

   When I do ti-64 global new relic isn't, is this causing the problem?

   I have deleted all of the non 64 bit modules, but still no luck - it does not build if I use the ti.facebook module, but builds fine without it</li>
<li>Samie 2016-03-09

   Deleted appcelerator , reinstalled it - same result:
   
   [ERROR] :  ** BUILD FAILED **
   [ERROR] :  The following build commands failed:
   [ERROR] :  	Ld build/Intermediates/newide.build/Debug-iphonesimulator/newide.build/Objects-normal/x86_64/newide normal x86_64

    Hey everyone,
    
    Some good news, I have managed to solve this problem!
    
    Basically this problem occurs if your XCODE version is not the latest version (currently version 7.2.1)! Here is the catch, to install that version if you are on a mac you will need to upgrade (if you are not on it) to El Capitan. 
    
    Your application should then build as normal. The only problem you will potentially face after building is the following:
    
    [INFO] :   *** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'InvalidOperationException', reason: 'fbauth2 is missing from your Info.plist under LSApplicationQueriesSchemes and is required for iOS 9.0'
    [INFO] :   *** First throw call stack:
    
    This is unrelated to this ticket, but if appcelerator can answer how to resolve that, that would be great.
