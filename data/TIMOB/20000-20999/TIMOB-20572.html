<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Description</h4>

When a device is not connected to a PC but its on the same network as the PC, when building a project for wp-device then it will still show up as available. This is because the utility used to obtain the device information, WinAppDeploy, supports deployment of an app over wifi and therefore will detect devices on wifi. See the below output for the differences between the output.

However, I believe that for this to happen the device needs to have 'Device Discovery' in 'For Developers' enabled. I am not sure whether this is enabled by default.

It is possible to deploy to a device over the network, but as far as I know this is not supported yet so for now we should filter devices that are displayed by the tool but appear to be connected over the network.
