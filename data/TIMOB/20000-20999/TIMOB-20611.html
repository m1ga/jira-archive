<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Description</h4>

When building to a Windows 10 Mobile device the app no longer open automatically as it did when building for 8.1, we should therefore inform the user of the need to open the app themselves similar to iOS

<h4>Steps to reproduce</h4>

1. Build to a Windows 10 mobile device using <code>appc run -p windows -T wp-device -S 10.0</code>

<h4>Actual result</h4>

The following will be logged, the user will not be informed of the need to open the app themselves

<code><pre>
[INFO]  Finished building the application in 1m 8s 283ms
[INFO]  Finished building the application in 1m 9s 870ms
[INFO]  Installing and launching the application
[INFO]  Project built successfully in 1m 11s 72ms
**User opens app**
[INFO]  Finished launching the application
[INFO]  Waiting for app to connect to log relay
</pre></code>

<h4>Expected result</h4>

We should inform the user of the need to open the app on the device, similar to iOS

   Did we apply this changes to <code>titanium_mobile</code>? I guess not.</li>

   The fix Gary made wasn't actually enough. It avoids the failure when we try to connect to win 10 mobile devices, but doesn't make any mention in the CLI telling the user to open the app, nor does it prevent failure when the command is "launch" and not "connect".
   
   I believe this PR addresses the issue: <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile_windows/pull/646" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile_windows/pull/646</a></li>

   Verified as fixed, Now get an appropriate warning message returned in the event that the app cannot be launched automatically for windows 10 mobile:
   <code><pre>
   [INFO]  Installing the application...
   [INFO]  Finished installing the application
   [INFO]  Waiting for app to connect to log relay
   [WARN]  We were unable to launch the app for you on the device/emulator due to an error (common causes include un-paired devices). Please launch the app manually.
   </pre></code>
