<h3>Description</h3>

Windows SDK uses a mocha test suite for unit testing it's APIs, currently living at <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile_windows/tree/master/Examples/NMocha/src/Assets" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile_windows/tree/master/Examples/NMocha/src/Assets</a>

iOS/Android use a suite living at <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/tree/master/ti_mocha_tests" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/tree/master/ti_mocha_tests</a>

We should combine our test suites into a common repository so that any new tests we add will be performed across all the OSes and we can easily pick up parity issues. It would involve updating our build scripts to grab the test suite from it's new location, and would likely involve more explicit attention to party issues or OS specific tests. (Meaning we'll need to know if a test case isn't intended to work on a particular platform and would have to code it into the test to skip it)

   There is now a common suite for iOS/Android that passes on Jenkins. Next step is to hook it up as a PR builder for Github PRs; to back port to Windows and ensure it all passes there as well; and to add some mechanism for titanium_mobile or titanium_mobile_windows to introduce local changes to the test suite that get run so we can check in unit tests as part of PRs.</li>

   Closing as this has been implemented</li>
