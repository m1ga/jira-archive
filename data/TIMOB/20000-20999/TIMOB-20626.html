<h3>Description</h3>

Originally reported on Ti.Slack. The user reports, that the (legacy) splash screen are packaged, even if the storyboard is used. 

Maybe it's just visible on the Simulator because the CLI fallbacks to the SplashScreens and it doesn't package it for production, but we should ensure it's not packaged at all.

   This is because of older versions of iOS. I don't remember if was for iOS 7 or 8. So, I'm not sure I would consider this a bug.
   
   Note that splash screens are the only way to support internationalized launch screens.</li>

   That's a very good reason! So as long as we support iOS 7, we need to package them. I guess.</li>
