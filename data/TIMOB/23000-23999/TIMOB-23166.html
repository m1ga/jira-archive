   I have investigated this issue and here are the results of my findings:
   
   Published 3 apps with different deployment targets (1. iPhone only ) (2. Universal) (3. iPad Only) to the app store and reviewed the Device Family specified for each app.
   1. iPhone / iPod Touch
   2. iPhone / iPod Touch, iPad
   3. iPad
   
   I additionally ran these packaged apps to iPad & iPhone devices:
   iPad: Able to deploy and launch *1* in iPhone idiom format. Able to deploy *2, 3* as normal.
   iPhone: Able to deploy and launch *1.2* as normal, unable to deploy *3.*
   
   Testing Environment:
   
   OSX El Capitan Version 10.11.4
   iPhone 6S Plus (9.3) & iPad Pro (9.3)
   Appc Studio: 4.6.0.201604081249 
   Ti SDK: 5.3.0.v20160421080259 
   Appc NPM: 4.2.5-3
   Appc Core: 5.3.0-34 
   Node: v4.4.2</li>

   The deploy is not the issue, we need to restrict the app to be only available for iPhone, like whatsapp for example. </li>

   [~cbarber] I think this is not possible right ? </li>

   Titanium correctly specifies the device family at build time and when Xcode builds the app, it will generate the <code>Info.plist</code> with the correct <code>UIDeviceFamily</code> value (<a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/iPhoneOSKeys.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009252-SW11)." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/iPhoneOSKeys.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009252-SW11).</a>
   
   Furthermore, Apple's App Store guidelines section 2.4.1 states:
   
   {quote}
   2.4.1 To ensure people get the most out of your app, iPhone apps should run on iPad whenever possible. We encourage you to consider building universal apps so customers can use them on all of their devices. Learn more about Universal apps.

   Older versions of the guidelines explicitly states that you cannot prevent an iPhone app from running on an iPad.
   
   Since they are no longer explicitly saying you can't do iPhone-only apps, I tried to find a way to restrict an app to iPhone, but I'm pretty sure it's not possible.</li>
