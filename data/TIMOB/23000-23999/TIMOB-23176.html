<h3>Description</h3>

Android Studio 2 is has a much better developer experience for keeping the SDK/NDK up to date and creating AVDs based on actual devices.

However, when I create an AVD in Android Studio I can successfully launch it from there, but they are not visible in Appcelerator Studio and when I run <code>ti info -t android</code> I get:

<code><pre>
  !  The Android emulator "Nexus_5_API_23" has a problem:
     Uknown error

  !  The Android emulator "Nexus_5X_API_22" has a problem:
     Google Nexus 5X no longer exists as a device

  !  The Android emulator "Nexus_5X_API_23" has a problem:
     Google Nexus 5X no longer exists as a device

  !  The Android emulator "Nexus_5X_API_23_2" has a problem:
     Google Nexus 5X no longer exists as a device
</pre></code>

The same errors (of course) show when I run <code>android list</code> directly.

When I open the stand-alone AVD manager via <code>android avd</code> the AVDs are listed but cannot be started. When I open _Edit_ them it displays an error _No device selected_ and _CPU/ABI_ has _No system images installed for this target._

Once I've started an AVD via Android Studio <code>ti info -t android</code> (and Appcelerator Studio) will show the emulator as a connected device:

<code><pre>
Connected Android Devices
Android SDK built for x86
  ID                          = emulator-5554
  State                       = device
  SDK Version                 = 6.0 (android-23)
  ABIs                        = x86,
</pre></code>

I can then successfully build to this emulator.

   I got this working after selecting another hardware profile (Nexus 5 instead of 5x) when creating the AVD. Something must be wrong with the other hardware profile. Could some one try to see if this is something unique to my environment or an Android Studio problem still?</li>

   <code>android</code> CLI tools which is used by Titanium seems to be deprecated as per Android Studio documentation, and doesn't work with emulators created via newer versions of Android Studio.</li>
