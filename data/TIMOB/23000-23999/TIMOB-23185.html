   Be very sure that is an acceptable workaround for people. The only reason we didn't remove it sooner is that people seemingly had legitimate uses for which this workaround was a PITA. But I could be mis-remembering.</li>

   [~fokkezb] any input on this too?</li>

   I really can't think of a good use case that justifies keeping this around any longer. People should just convert the files to CommonJS. And we've been deprecating this long enough now.</li>

   It will break our Alloy run-time tests, but we'll have to refactor that as part of [~cbarber]'s refactoring of Alloy anyway.</li>

   [~cng] It's about time...Things to do:
   - Remove method from iOS and Android
   - Add a link to the docs like:
   {quote}
   The method "Ti.include" was deprecated in 3.3.0 and removed in 6.0.0. Please use "require" instead and check the migration-guide at http://...
   {quote}
   - Validate the affect on Alloy ([~fmiao], can you help with that?)
   - Include the removal and migration wiki inside our blog-post - before beta, so people can already start migrating it, if they do not already done over the last 2.5 (!) years.</li>

   [~msamah] can start working on the android part.</li>

   Posted a PR for master/6.1.0: <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/8499" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/8499</a></li>

   oh man. I love this PR and wished it came earlier. I can't have it for 6.1.0 because it's a <code>remove</code>.
   and I'm a little reluctant to merge it now because it seems there are some other dependencies like alloy and our window to 6.0.0 is really small now. 
   Can we retain this PR for the next major release?</li>
<li>Christopher Williams 2016-10-12

   Yeah that's fine. My understanding is that Ti.include **never** worked with alloy, so removing it should not impact alloy.</li>
