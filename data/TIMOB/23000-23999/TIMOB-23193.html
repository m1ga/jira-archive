<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Description</h4>

Currently in the CLI we have a couple of options that are target specific in their naming, namely *\--wp-sdk* and *\--ws-cert*, these options should become target agnostic in their naming as the usage has changed with the introduction of support for Windows 10 and they are no longer specific to a certain target, for example --wp-sdk can be used to change the SDK for a ws-local build, and a cert can be passed into a phone build

   So what about introducing
   
   * *win-cert* for replacement of *ws-cert*
   * *win-sdk* for replacement of *wp-sdk*
   
   I found another confusing options from the [Command-Line Interface Reference](<a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#</a>!/guide/Appcelerator_Command-Line_Interface_Reference):
   
   * *wp8-publisher-guid*
   * *wp-product-guid*
   
   I'm not sure if *wp8-publisher-guid* is actually used but we might want to change them into *win-publisher-id* and *win-product-guid*.

   That renaming sounds good to me (y). For backwards compatibility with Studio would it be best to keep the existing options around but hidden from -h and then removing them in another release? Maybe hide/deprecate in the version you decide and then remove in 7.0.0? If I remember right I think the hiding of options can be done in config.js. Also, I'll file a ticket now for Studio to adopt these once done
   
   As for those two confusing options, I believe they are intended specifically for moving a phone 8 app phone to 8.1, this is probably a holdover from mobile web. I guess maybe we could follow the same process as the above if they're deemed unneeded?</li>
<li>Kota Iguchi 2016-09-13

   Yes, for backwards compatibility I would think we want to deprecate <code>wp-\*</code> and <code>ws-\*</code> options in <code>6.1.0</code> and remove it in next major version <code>7.0.0</code>.
   
   * ws-cert → win-cert
   * wp-sdk → win-sdk
   * wp-product-guid  → win-product-guid
   
   For <code>wp8-publisher-guid</code>, I'm not yet sure if we really use it in non-mobieweb build. If it is Windows Phone 8.0 specific option, I think we can deprecate and remove it as of <code>7.0.0</code> because we are not supporting Windows Phone 8.0 anymore.
   
   Or more proactively, we might want think about deprecating/removing support for Windows Phone 8.1 in <code>7.0.0</code>? > [~cng]

<li>Kota Iguchi 2016-09-13

   ok confirmed <code>wp8-publisher-guid</code> does not exist. There's <code>wp-publisher-guid</code> instead. This will be renamed to <code>win-publisher-guid</code>.</li>
<li>Kota Iguchi 2016-09-13

   Ah no, renaming <code>wp-publisher-guid</code> to <code>win-publisher-guid</code> seems more confusing because we already have <code>win-publisher-id</code> which is used to specify Windows Publisher ID. I think we want to keep <code>wp-publisher-guid</code> for now and remove it in the version where we remove Windows Phone 8.1 support.</li>

   We forgot to add <code>fixVersion</code>...this should go to <code>6.1.0</code>.
   
   *Test Case*
   
   <code><pre>
   // testing win-cert
   appc run -p windows --target dist-winstore -l trace --win-cert generated.cer
   
   // testing win-sdk works with 10.0
   appc run -p windows --build-only --target wp-device -l trace --win-sdk 10.0
   
   // testing win-sdk works with specific 10.0 version
   appc run -p windows --build-only --target wp-device -l trace --win-sdk 10.0.10586.0
   
   // win-product-guid
   appc run -p windows --build-only --target wp-device -l trace --win-product-guid f0473be1-c557-4f98-a103-4ba9f453b5b0
   </pre></code></li>

   Verified improvements, tested with commands from [~kota] mentioned above. 
   
   *Test steps*
   * Created a titanium project 
   * Ran the following command <code>appc run -p windows --target dist-winstore -l trace --win-cert generated.cer</code>
   * Followed the prompts 
   * Application was built to the <code>dist</code> folder without any issues 
   * Then ran the following command <code>appc run -p windows --build-only --target wp-device -l trace --win-sdk 10.0</code>
   * Application was built successfully 
   * Then ran the following command <code>appc run -p windows --build-only --target wp-device -l trace --win-sdk 10.0.10586.0</code>
   * Application built successfully 
   * Then ran the following com <code>appc run -p windows --build-only --target wp-device -l trace --win-product-guid f0473be1-c557-4f98-a103-4ba9f453b5b0</code>
   * Application was built without any issues 
   
   *Environment*

   [~kota], does this sound like a good summary for this ticket for the 6.1.0 release note?
   
   * Deprecated the commands for wp-*﻿ and ws-*﻿
   * The following replaces the deprecated commands:
   ** ws-cert > win-cert
   ** wp-sdk > win-sdk
   ** wp-product-guid > win-product-guid</li>
<li>Kota Iguchi 2017-05-19

    [~bimmel] Yes, that sounds good (y)</li>
