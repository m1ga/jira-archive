		"description": "I would like to request research into Android parity with iOS's iCloud automatic backups.\r\n\r\nAndroid 6 now has an automatic backup service, but my app is not being included by default. It would seem Ti apps on this version of Android could be configured via manifest.xml modifications, but would need some documentation to understand how this would work in the Ti SDK context, e.g. supplying file paths etc.\r\n\r\nOn earlier versions of Android that are compatible with Ti SDK my understanding is that a BackupAgent would need to be added to interface with Android's Backup API. However, it's not clear if this would work as a Ti module.\r\n\r\nSee this SO thread with Fokke for links to appropriate Android SDK docs: [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36408739/anyone-implemented-android-backup-service-with-androidbackupagent]",
