<h3>Description</h3>

Hello Guys,

As per Apple documentation: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/FileManagement/Conceptual/FileSystemProgrammingGuide/FileSystemOverview/FileSystemOverview.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010672-CH2-SW28" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/FileManagement/Conceptual/FileSystemProgrammingGuide/FileSystemOverview/FileSystemOverview.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010672-CH2-SW28</a> app's documents folder data can be shared/sync.

As per appcelerator documentation: <a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#</a>!/guide/Filesystem_Access_and_Storage Ti.Filesystem.applicationDataDirectory can only accessible by app itself. If a file is added in app's Documents folder using
{color:#205081}var f = Ti.Filesystem.getFile(timelogsData,'errors.log');f.write(data); {color}
It can't sync/share it is only accessible by app itself.

We need an ability to create file inside Downloads folder and/or ability to create file inside App's Documents folder that can be share/sync.

Thanks

   Hello,
   
   Thanks for creating the ticket. Our engineering team will look into it. This need to be cleared by our selection committee. Please understand that the processes is time-consuming and lots of variables in play. We will let you know if and when we will be including this feature in our platform.
   
   Regards,
   Sharif.

   The files can be accessed like natively, but what you are searching for is the way to share those, which required the share extensions functionality. That is discussed in TIMOB-17335 and requires you to create a new target that is responsible for sharing your content.</li>

   I'm guessing this ticket can be closed as duplicate, or is there still something that can be done in Titanium?</li>

   [~topener] I would revisit it, because my thought back last year was that it's about sharing content, but instead it's rather accessing it via shared directories. </li>
