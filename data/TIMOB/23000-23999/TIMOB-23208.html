<h3>Description</h3>

Project appears to successfully build but doesn't launch in the emulator, I get the same error when trying to build for device. This issue was here in 5.1.2 and now still in 5.2.0. However I used to be able to build fine and now getting this error.

   Hello,
   
   Thanks for your report. What do you get when you run the app through terminal? Use below command and let us know.
   
   appc run -p windows -T wp-emulator

   It looks like just a missing final callback for the first function in async.parallel.
   But I can't test as our windows system is not set up properly yet.
