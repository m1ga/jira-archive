<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Description</h4>

It was found that when deploying an alloy mobile project to a windows 10 mobile device, the splash screen is not present, and instead presents a black screen with a white crossed box in the center. This does not occur for classic projects, or alloy/classic projects on 8.1 devices.

<h4>Steps to Reproduce</h4>
1. Create an alloy mobile project.
2. In the Command Prompt, cd into project directory.
3. <code>appc run -p windows -T wp-device --wp-sdk 10.0</code>
4. Launch app once built. 

<h4>Actual Result</h4>

No splash screen on launch, white box instead


<h4>Expected Result</h4>

Splash screen should be present on launch of app.

   Just to confirm:
   - This happens for Alloy projects on Win 10 mobile?
   - It doesn't happen for Alloy projects on Win 8.1 mobile?
   - It doesn't happen for classic projects on Win 8.1 mobile?
   - It doesn't happen for classic projects on Win 10 mobile?</li>

   I believe the white box with an X in it is sort of a "default" splash screen/logo used. I believe it comes from cmake itself:
   titanium_mobile_windows/cli/vendor/cmake/share/cmake-3.4/Templates/Windows/SplashScreen.png
   
   What I don't understand is why that would be used, when in other cases we use the "default" Appcelerator splashes from titanium_mobile_windows/templates/build/Assets</li>

   Alloy default splash screen image for windows, <code>SplashScreen.png</code> is also a white crossed box, not sure if it's the culprit:

   What do you see if you replace <code>&lt;projectdir&gt;\app\assets\windows\SplashScreen.png</code> with a different image file? Do you still see the white box?</li>

   So I tested this a little too with 5.2.2.GA. If I did a classic ti project for win 10 mobile, it used the default SplashScreen.png from windows SDK (which still isn't quite right in the way it looks visually, I should file a ticket for that). When I ran alloy new on the project and then built, it used the white box with an X in it for the splash screen. So it definitely is coming from alloy.
   
   When I build with alloy, during the build process is when I see new image assets copied into the Resources/windows folder.
   
   So it looks like if I have no custom splash screen, then with a classic app it falls back to the proper splashes we have as defaults in Windows SDK. If I have none with an alloy app, it uses Alloy's default splash screens for windows. The fix here may be to simply ship fixed/better default splash screens in alloy for Windows.</li>

   Additionally, I think because we use the DefaultIcon.png stuff in Windows to generate icons, we probably don't need the Logo/SmallLogo/StoreLogo files.</li>

   [~cwilliams] can confirm, This occurs ONLY on alloy projects for windows 10 mobile, it does not affect classic projects, or alloy projects for windows 8.1 </li>
