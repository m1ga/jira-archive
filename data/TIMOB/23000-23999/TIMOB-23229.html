<h3>Description</h3>

In one of the my Appcelerator Project there is one functionality like,

We are showing a remote webpage in webview and in that webpage there is Photo Upload Browse button.

By clicking on that button Option dialog comes that ask to choose photo from Camera or Photo Gallery and we can select the photo.

That functionality is works fine in iOS but in android Titanium SDK has not support to choose and upload a photo from remote web page which is loaded on webview.

Earlier we are using a modified Titanium SDK. Can you please modified latest Titanium SDK(5.2.X Onwards) that support this feature.

Modified SDK (<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/j2csab3dhy6w3u2/4.1.0.GA_For_Correction_Camera_Web_upload.zip?dl=0)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.dropbox.com/s/j2csab3dhy6w3u2/4.1.0.GA_For_Correction_Camera_Web_upload.zip?dl=0)</a> which allow to select photo from gallery or camera and this working fine in iOS and Android so the same change I need for latest version of Titanium SDK (5.2.X Onwards)

If you know, what changes we have to do in Titanium SDK to support this feature so can you suggest me in which file of Titanium SDK we need to do changes and what changes we have to write Titanium SDK files ?.

   We need a master PR first since it's the base branch. Backports can make as soon as the master is approved. Since this is a feature, it probably won't go into 5_2_X, but it can be cherry-picked if anyone needs it. If we can review and merge the upcoming master-PR soon, it can go into 5.4.0. Thanks everyone!</li>

   Can you please make the changes in Titanium in any of 5.2.X series of SDK and give me because I can't wait for next upcoming Ti.SDK release, last time I got modified SDK from you with this feature.

   Can you modified any current Titanium 5.2.X version of SDK and send me back, as earlier we got the same because I can't wait for next release when it will available and our application is LIVE already. Moreover, I also have to give the support of Android 6.0 and Android 6.0 support can't be possible in 4.1.0GA SDK because it takes TargetSDK 22 and we have uploaded Target SDK 23 on store.
   
   In short I need any of current Titanium 5.2.X version of SDK which allow me to select photo from webview in android as I have mentioned above. (attachment)
   
   It's very urgent so please co-operate me.</li>

   [~nkapupara@tacme.com] We would be glad to help and assist. The PR <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/7949" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/7949</a> contains a lot of changes which is not what is needed for this issue. (Hans mentioned it in the PR.
   
   Would you have the exact changes (or a previous JIRA ticket so that we can check) that was done for the customised 4.1.0.GA?
   </li>
<li>Ashraf Abu 2016-04-19

   I believe this ticket was what was done previously: TIMOB-19463</li>
<li>Ashraf Abu 2016-04-19

   Cherry-picked the changes in TIMOB-19463 into 5_2_X branch. Branch is located here <a href="https://github.com/ashcoding/titanium_mobile/tree/5_2_X_TIMOB-23229" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/ashcoding/titanium_mobile/tree/5_2_X_TIMOB-23229</a> (Ready)</li>
<li>Ashraf Abu 2016-04-19

   Branch mentioned above contains the changes needed and is in the 5_2_X branch that can be compiled to create a customised SDK and needs to be tested to check that the functionality is available.
   Updated: I tested with test case provided in TIMOB-19463. Working.</li>
<li>Ashraf Abu 2016-04-19

    [~nkapupara@tacme.com] You should be able to use this branch <a href="https://github.com/ashcoding/titanium_mobile/tree/5_2_X_TIMOB-23229" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/ashcoding/titanium_mobile/tree/5_2_X_TIMOB-23229</a> and compile it to create a custom SDK with the function you need.</li>
<li>Nikunj Kapupara 2016-04-19

    In which SDK you have checked that the Android webview photo upload can work. means I can open the Photo Gallery/ Camera by clicking on Browse button on the remote webpage which is loaded on webview in ANDROID

    *Would you have the exact changes (or a previous JIRA ticket so that we can check) that was done for the customised 4.1.0.GA?*
    -> Yes, That changes has been done previously but I have not previous JIRA ticket records. I am trying to check whether previous one is this or not: TIMOB-19463 but I am getting Permission violation web page so I can't say about this.
    
     Would you have the exact changes (or a previous JIRA ticket so that we can check) that was done for the customised 4.1.0.GA?
    The changes done by your team and I don't know what the changes they did in this Modified SDK (<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/j2csab3dhy6w3u2/4.1.0.GA_For_Correction_Camera_Web_upload.zip?dl=0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.dropbox.com/s/j2csab3dhy6w3u2/4.1.0.GA_For_Correction_Camera_Web_upload.zip?dl=0</a>
    
    But support this feature I need same changes to be done in any of current 5_2_X series of Titanium SDK and send me that SDK so I can work with this feature in android.</li>
<li>Nikunj Kapupara 2016-04-19

    Our team or I don't know which the changes needs to do for this feature that's why I am requesting to you/team so that I can use this feature in any of our Titanium 5.2.X version of SDK.
    
    Thanks and Regards,</li>
<li>Ashraf Abu 2016-04-19

    [~nkapupara@tacme.com] It's all done. The branch is here:  <a href="https://github.com/ashcoding/titanium_mobile/tree/5_2_X_TIMOB-23229" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/ashcoding/titanium_mobile/tree/5_2_X_TIMOB-23229</a> and you can compile it to use it. </li>
<li>Nikunj Kapupara 2016-04-19

    It's Ok.. very nice to hear from you.. Let me check this feature first in Android: *Photo upload from remote webpage in webview*</li>
<li>Nikunj Kapupara 2016-04-19

    You mean to say, I can put it in my Titanium SDK directory and use this SDK and run the project in android to check?? M I right?

    Ok.. Let me check if this working as per my requirement.
    Actially, can you tell me which SDK version you have modified. I am asking because I also need to give the support for Android 6.0.</li>
<li>Shuo Liang 2016-04-19

    I compiled this SDK based on 5.2.2.</li>
<li>Nikunj Kapupara 2016-04-19

    Ohh. Great Latest one!!!. Can I expect this feature in next upcoming Titanium SDK update????</li>
<li>Nikunj Kapupara 2016-04-19

    When I compile & Run my appcelerator project using this modified 5.2.2 SDK with Ti.Cloudpush (3.4.1) module I can't run run app I am getting Java compiling exception.

    I have find out on Google about this error many of says Ti.Cloudpush module is not working properly. There is some bugs in that module.
    
    Mine problem is If I use Ti.cloudpush module 3.3.8 the app is working fine, but not in Android 6 (Marsh mellow) at that time I am getting this error on app startup:

    If I use the Ti.cloupush module 3.4.1 or 3.4.0 then I can't even compile the project and I am getting those mentioned java compile exception and execution is stopped.
    
    Tell me what to do now. Can you please give me the bug free ticloudpush module which is can run with this 5.2.2 modified SDK 
    
    Thanks and Regards.
    
    </li>
<li>Ashraf Abu 2016-04-20

    Purely running with Only Ti.Cloudpush 3.4.1 is not causing any issues alone. What other modules are you including into your project? It seems the errors are related to google-play-services.jar dependencies.
    
    The google play jar could be removed by going to the other modules that you have in your project in "modules">"android">"module-name">"version">"lib">"google-play-services.jar". Removing this will stop that error but would require you to be sure that you would not need that module to access the google-play-services. Alternatively, that other module needs updating with the proper google-play jar.
    
    In order to help, we would need to know what other modules are being included.</li>
<li>Nikunj Kapupara 2016-04-20

    The other modules which I am using in my project is:
    
    *iOS & Android (Both):*
    com.appcelerator.apm
    ti.map
    facebook
    ti.cloud
    
    *Android: ti.cloudpush*
    iOS: path.animator
    
    +I don't think the problem with another module as you are talking google play jar file because if you check the log it clearly mentioned the error related to cloudpush+

<li>Ashraf Abu 2016-04-20

    That is using Ti.Cloudpush 3.3.8 correct?</li>

    Yes, Ti.cloudpush 3.3.8 for Android

<li>Ashraf Abu 2016-04-20

    [^ti.cloudpush-android-3.3.9.zip] Attached here is 3.3.9. This should solve your issue. Please use this. Thank you. [~nkapupara@tacme.com]</li>
<li>Ashraf Abu 2016-04-20

    Also please note, on Android 6.0, if you are going to use the choose file option, you need to add in your code to request camera permission if you want to allow the user to be able to take a photo directly.</li>
<li>Nikunj Kapupara 2016-04-20

    Any way I have to thank you for your quick and easy support for this modified SDK...
    
    *_+Thank you so so so much for your help and support.+_*</li>
<li>Ashraf Abu 2016-04-20

    Did the cloudpush version 3.3.9 work for you?</li>
<li>Nikunj Kapupara 2016-04-20

    No sorry,
    *It's not worked. When I used 3.3.9 Ti.cloudpush module I got the google play jar conflicting error.*

    As mentioned in the error log:
    
    [ERROR] : 
    [ERROR] : The following modules have different "google-play-services.jar" files
    [ERROR] : ti.map (version 2.3.1) (hash=a9b753b4c63719e24d0022e341c57b2e)
    [ERROR] : ti.cloudpush (version 3.3.9) (hash=93f8dd307017098f89f81d72439473ae)
    [ERROR] : 
    [ERROR] : You can either select a version of these modules where the conflicting jar file is the same or you
    [ERROR] : can try copying the jar file from one module's "lib" folder to the other module's "lib" folder.
    
    What you should do is you should use ti.map version 2.3.1 and ti.cloudpush 3.3.9. And after in your project folder, you should try this:-
    Project>modules>android>ti.cloudpush>3.3.9>lib>google-play-services.jar  Copy this file. And put it in:-
    Project>modules>android>ti.map>2.3.1>lib> 
    This will allow both modules to use the same "google-play-services.jar".</li>

    This is a bug and it's only fixed in Ti.Map <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator-modules/ti.map/releases/tag/android-2.3.10" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator-modules/ti.map/releases/tag/android-2.3.10</a>
    If you use this, you need to change your Ti.Cloudpush to version 3.4.1 to ensure the google play dependencies are correct.</li>

    [~nkapupara@tacme.com] Welcome.
    Please take note for future updates for that app, the required function that you need is not in the GA SDK. It's only provided in the custom SDK. </li>

    No problem for resolving ticket, anyway my bug is fixed and working fine. But why you are not including this feature (ANDROID: Support to Photo upload from remote webpage in webview) in upcoming Titanium SDK release. Many of developer can user this feature.
    
    Ok... Thanks for your help and support.</li>

    There is no way yet to upload a file via Webview on Android ?
