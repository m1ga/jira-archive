<h3>Description</h3>

There is no option to animate a marker to a new position with heading and new latitude, longitude. You can only remove the annotation and add the new one. We had to stop the development of a clients app (cars tracking) because of this.

   Hello, 
   
   Can you provide an example of the feature available in native (iOS or Android). It would be helpful to understand the requested feature if you provide some screenshots or a video demonstration.

   Hi Sharif
   
   Please check this gif examples:

   and here is the sample code for native android.

   i've created an app and just realized that appcelerator doesn't have this feature that is native in both android and ios. Will you be available to do this soon? We have to upload the app in 30 days.
   
   thank you!</li>

   hi Sharif those examples work for you? 
   
   thank you!</li>

   Hello, 
   
   Thanks for your reply with the example. Our engineers will take a look at the feature. You have to understand that the process is time-consuming and lots of variable in play. We will let you know whether or not we decide to integrate the feature in our platform. 
   
   Regards,

   thank you!</li>

   Any update on this? I also need to be able to animate an annotation between two points for fleet tracking. Here is a great example of an implementation in JS for Google Maps: <a href="https://github.com/terikon/marker-animate-unobtrusive" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/terikon/marker-animate-unobtrusive</a> Demo: <a href="http://terikon.github.io/marker-animate-unobtrusive/demo/unobtrusive/markermove-sliding.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://terikon.github.io/marker-animate-unobtrusive/demo/unobtrusive/markermove-sliding.html</a></li>

   More than a year and no follow up or updates. This is a very important thing to have. 
   Thanks!</li>
