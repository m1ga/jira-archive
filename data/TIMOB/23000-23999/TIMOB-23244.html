<h3>Description</h3>

*Summary*

Creating Windows 10 module failed on Windows 8.1, or under the environment where Visual Studio 2015 is not installed. 

*Steps to Reproduce*

Run <code>appc new -n test --id com.example.test</code> under the environment where Windows 8.1, or Visual Studio 2015 is not installed.

-------------

I am using modules for Windows at the moment (as you know) and I compiled my "old" module with the SDK 5.4.0.v20160406002717 and this SDK created a fully functioning zip archive that I could copy over to project root and the run, decompress and use successfully (still not doing background service at this point).

After updating my appc ti sdks list and make sure I select the latest 5.4.0.v20160419234222 and go back, clean my module build folder AND the temp folder in AppData and them rebuild the build goes though BUT when it tried to package the app it tries to package some Windows 10 targets, targets that I do not have since I use Windows 8.1 OS and Phone 8.1 I do not have Win 10 at all, also I use the visial studio 2013, so there are no Win 10 targets or folders yet it tries to package this into the zip file, the script dies and do not continue to package the rest. Effectively I end up with a zip file = 0 bytes and unuseable...

   Building Windows 10 target should fail when you use VS 2013 because it doesn't support building against Windows 10 project. So I think we can't build it technically.

   OK, I trust you know better then me! :)
   
   The problem I experienced was that at build when I had the old module it could not package on my system because it "thought" it had win 10 targets, obviously I did not since I run phone 8,1 and no Win 10 host...
   
   So I take it that now when creating a module in a win phone 8.1 system (with no win 10) with visual 2013 it will only create the phone 8.1 targets and when building it will package only that
   
   And then on win 10 it can package for both 8.1 and 10 ?
   
   This is I build before with the ti build command and now you build with appc run which I have not been able to test yet.
   
   As long as you know the above works we should be good
   
   Thanks</li>
