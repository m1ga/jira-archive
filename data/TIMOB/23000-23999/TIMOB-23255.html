<h3>Description</h3>

Since Map is part of the support in Windows release as of today the Map annotations should work better, there are a number of problems where this is one:

*The annotation click view doe snot work and we cannot use the annotation for anything useful*

Additionally:

When we add, remove and add annotations to the map it crashes
The title of the annotation is always displayed (?) this can´t be right
The annotation image is always red..

For the Map to work at all we have to have basic support, these things are very basic support to be able to "use" the map for anything else than map display... 

Let us know where we stand here.. thanks

   Please disregard the "Annotations always red" comment, this is now verified and it works.</li>

   It's hard to tell what exactly this ticket is about. Do you have screenshots for the issues? We likely need to break this into multiple tickets to cover the various issues raised and investigate them.
   
   Sounds like:
   - Adding, then removing, then adding an annotation to a map crashes?
   - Clicking on an annotation doesn't do anything?
   - The title of annotations is just question marks?
   
   Please provide some sample code to reproduce and a screenshot so we can see what it is that you're experiencing. Details on your environment (i.e. what OS, are you targeting Windows 10 or 8.1? Store or phone apps? What version of the SDK are you using?) would always be helpful.</li>

   Marking as "Needs more info" until we have enough info to determine what's going on here.</li>

   [~buder] Since you opened a duplicate ticket, we've been using the other ticket as the reference. I'm going to close this one and TIMOB-23343 is the one we can refer to.</li>
