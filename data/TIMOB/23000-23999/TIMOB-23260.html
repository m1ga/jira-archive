<h3>Description</h3>

Once index.js has been executed the following is shown in the log:

[INFO] :   Finished launching the application
[INFO] :   Waiting for app to connect to log relay
-- End application log -------------------------------------------------------

This means that no asynchronous events in the code will be printed and debugging is quite hard to say the least.

   Hello,
   Thanks for reporting. The phenomena that you described is not supposed to happen. It is possible to get error and debug log in the console for Windows Phone. Following is an example of console log that I get for an app on Windows Phone Emulator.
   <code><pre>
   -- Start application log -----------------------------------------------------
   [INFO] :   Finished launching the application
   [INFO] :   Waiting for app to connect to log relay
   [ERROR] :  Number of buttons exceeds platform maximum (2), list will be truncated.
   [INFO] :   Disconnected from app
   -- End application log -------------------------------------------------------
   </pre></code>
   Please let us know the following things.
   1. If it is happening every time for any code.
   2. If your app is crashing.
   3. Your environment details.
   4. If it happening for some particular code in index.js please share it.

   1. If it is happening every time for any code. 
   
   Yes, it is 100% reproducible. My colleague who is working on the same project does not get this error however.
   
   2. If your app is crashing. 
   
   No, not that I'm aware of.
   
   3. Your environment details. 
   
   See comment above
   
   4. If it happening for some particular code in index.js please share it.
   
   I will try to isolate this in a minimal app and get back to you later with details.</li>
<li>Jonas Bjurhult 2016-04-20

   I can reproduce this by creating a new default alloy app:
   index.js:
   <code><pre>
   function doClick(e) {
       Ti.API.info("Hi there");
       alert($.label.text);
   }
   
   $.win.open();
   </pre></code>
   
   index.xml:
   <code><pre>
   <Alloy>
   	<Window class="container" id="win">
   		<Label id="label" onClick="doClick">Hello, World</Label>
   	</Window>
   </Alloy>
   </pre></code>
   
   The log says:
   
   -- Start application log -----------------------------------------------------
   [INFO] :   Finished launching the application
   [INFO] :   Waiting for app to connect to log relay
   [INFO] :   ACS Login Results for environment <code>development</code>:
   [INFO] [object Object]
   -- End application log -------------------------------------------------------
   
   The Ti.API.info("Hi there"); is not printed when I click the label</li>
<li>Jörgen Buder 2016-04-22

   Let me know if you need me to test anything in the backgournd service and the LOG marco you have there, that is the only problem I have on my host, but I know Win 10 seems more problematic...</li>
<li>Kota Iguchi 2016-04-22

   Tested <code>5.3.0.v20160418111755</code> on Windows 10 but I was not able to reproduce this. [~jonasbjurhult] Do you set something special on your <code>tiapp.xml</code>? For example native module or <code>Capabilities</code> etc.  I also wonders if there's some kind of firewall program running in background that prevents logger from running. Note that Titanium CLI uses specific port to receive log (I think it's around <code>8666</code>.</li>
<li>Jonas Bjurhult 2016-04-22

   I run a default installation of Windows 10 Pro in Parallels, no programs added beside the dev tools needed for Titanium development.
   I tried disabling windows firewall but still get the same result.</li>
<li>Jonas Bjurhult 2016-04-29

   This works when running windows 8.1 enterprise so it is probably a Windows 10 problem</li>
<li>Kota Iguchi 2016-05-06

   Just got Parallels for me. Titanium CLI logging worked for me on Windows 10 & Parallels on Mac. In order to logging work, I needed to change Parallels Networks sources to "*Wi-Fi*".
   
   !setting.png|thumbnail!
   
    As side note, I'm note sure if it's related but I enabled "Enable nested virtualization" according to [Installing the Windows Phone SDK](<a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#</a>!/guide/Installing_the_Windows_Phone_SDK-section-43306274_InstallingtheWindowsPhoneSDK-RunningWindows8withParallels).</li>
<li>Kota Iguchi 2016-05-07

    I have also experienced that I actually needed to sign out my local account from Windows, that's needed because Windows requires re-sign-in (or restart) to update Windows Hyper-V related configuration. Without sign-out, logging disconnected for me just like this ticket describes. Just in case, hope this helps.
    </li>
<li>Kota Iguchi 2016-05-17

    [~jonasbjurhult] This still doesn't work for you? I've tried *Wi-Fi* network and "Enable nested virtualization" and then re-sigin-in worked for me like described above, and I'm interested to see if it works for you.</li>
<li>Kota Iguchi 2016-05-27

    I try to reproduce this using Windows 10 + Parallels on Mac but had no luck. we may need more info to reproduce this.</li>
