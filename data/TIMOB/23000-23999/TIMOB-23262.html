<h3>Description</h3>

In the attachment you can see the "test" screen of the Windows Phone Simulator Camera. In both Android and iOS, when you open up the camera you get a full-screen windows instead of just a view like this.

The overlay view is the result of:

<code><pre>
Titanium.Media.showCamera();
</pre></code>

   So I see that we can create an "overlay" view on top. What do the other platforms do here? I'd assume you'd want some way to control the area the camera takes up. An overlay is nice, but what if you want the overlay to take some of the screen and the camera preview to take the rest without being cropped by the overlay?</li>
<li>Rene Pot 2016-05-02

   On both android and ios the camera function displays a fullscreen overlay with buttons to control the camera. On windows phone this same overlay is visible when going to the gallery from an app, and then clicking the camera icon on the bottom. </li>

   Merged to master. It'd be good to get some testing on a build once it's out, since we saw some varying behavior on different devices.</li>

   Verified as fixed, Opening the camera without specifying the overlay property now launches as a full screen window. Closing this ticket as it fixes the stated issue, however it should be of note that currently there are no native camera controls (which has been addressed for a later release, see TIMOB-23427 for more details).
