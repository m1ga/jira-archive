<h3>Description</h3>

Currently, it is a pain in the butt to deal with a device that has not yet been paired. The user needs to install an app to the device/emulator through Visual Studio to have it set up the pairing/developer mode for the user. But even then, we don't really inform the user that's the best/easiest course of action to get started.

It'd be nice to add additional tooling to be able to walk a user through manually pairing a device/emulator outside Visual Studio. Or informing them how to get setup once with a blank app in VS.

For manual setup:
1. connect device
2. Ask user to go to Settings > Personalization > Lock Screen > set to 5 mins+ (so phone doesn't lock mid-build/deploy)
3. Walk user through Settings > Update & Security > Change to 'developer mode'. (to enable app installs)
4. Click Pair button (for emulators, don't need to pair for device over USB)
5. Ask user to enter the pair code in our CLI, we deploy a simple blank app to device to get initial pairing done.
6. No more access denied/etc!

   In addition to Kotas note, I successfully connected and installed an app to a mobile device over the network using winappdeploycmd and the -pin option. I had been unable to do before the latest release of universal tools</li>
