But I'm going to file it anyway so that it's documented for someone else who might encounter the same issue.\r\n\r\nI’ve been struggling with camera focus issues on iOS. In our app, focus on some iPhones is fixed at 15-20 cm. But I can’t reproduce it outside our app. You can try with the attached, which mimics our app's use of the camera. On affected devices, it doesn't matter whether you use the full-screen camera or the camera with an overlay like our app uses. And, it's not consistent to device type...some iPhone 6's are affected, others are not for example. But on those devices affected, the issue is constant. On my iPhone 5, the camera is always fixed focus with our app (though works fine in other apps, native camera app, etc.).\r\n\r\nAdding {{auto-focus-camera}} to the UIRequiredDeviceCapabilities in tiapp.xml seems to have fixed it. I would assume that that key is added automatically to the plist whenever you use the camera. But, maybe not?\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n<key>UIRequiredDeviceCapabilities</key>\r\n<array>\r\n  <string>auto-focus-camera</string>\r\n  <string>front-facing-camera</string>\r\n  <string>camera-flash</string>\r\n  ...\r\n{code}",
