<h3>Description</h3>

We are running a fairly complex Windows app and we are experiencing timeouts in the deploy process to the device every now and then.. (50% at least of the times we build consecutive)

I have seen that specifically when one app needs to be removed as well as installed easy takes more than 60 sec... can we change this somehow?

The workaround I have now is that I  need to deinstall the existing app every time AND clean the project, this takes time.. can I change this timeout easily?

   Resolving this for now as <code>--deploy-timeout</code> is already implemented. Feel free to reopen if that's not the case.</li>
