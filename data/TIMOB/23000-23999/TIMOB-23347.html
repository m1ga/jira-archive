<h3>Description</h3>

Once I have build a Windows app to my device and then build another (different) one the console says:

<code><pre>
[ERROR] :  A debug application is already installed, please remove existing debug application
[ERROR] :  Error: A debug application is already installed, please remove existing debug application
</pre></code>

I have to remove the previous app before I can install the other. This is a bad Developer Experience. I cannot keep an app I need to demo every to a client or co-worker installed while working on another.

This might be a Windows limitation since it's an error we translate:

   Yes this is a limitation of the Windows tooling, there's no way of knowing what debug application is currently installed. So it's down to the user to uninstall it. I don't think there is much we can do about this.</li>

   [~gmathews] I was afraid for that :( So on an Windows Phone device you can only develop one app at the same time? Crazy.</li>
