<h3>Description</h3>

Windows builds can take some time, we should try to reduce this time as much as possible. There are a few things we can do to achieve this.

- During the build and installation process <code>wptool.exe</code> is executed a number of times in order to detect Windows devices. This is a time expensive process and also happens during desktop builds, which is unnecessary. We can combat this by caching the first results and re-use them (this is partially implemented already).

- When building apps that have previously been built, the build project is deleted and re-created again. Which also means a complete build is required again. This can be avoided by retaining the existing project and old copy over changes that have been made. Requiring only a partial rebuild.

- If the app already exists on the phone, we should attempt to make use of the <code>update</code> command in the deploy tool. This should be must faster than the two step process of <code>uninstall</code> and <code>install</code>.

   This is a smallish saving that could be made, I just used [console.time and console.timeEnd](<a href="https://nodejs.org/api/console.html#console_console_time_label)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://nodejs.org/api/console.html#console_console_time_label)</a> to check how long it takes to copy the files back to the original build dir, and it seems to be around 2.5 seconds. This is on a Macbook Pro retina with an ssd, so I imagine a traditional hdd will be even slower. From reading the code it seems like this is blocking so the build process will wait for this to complete before moving on
   
   <code><pre>
   [INFO]  Copying results back to project build directory
   copied
   copystuff: 2516ms
   [INFO]  Project built successfully in 45s 523ms
   </pre></code></li>
</ol>
