		"description": "Windows builds can take some time, we should try to reduce this time as much as possible. There are a few things we can do to achieve this.\r\n\r\n- During the build and installation process {{wptool.exe}} is executed a number of times in order to detect Windows devices. This is a time expensive process and also happens during desktop builds, which is unnecessary. We can combat this by caching the first results and re-use them (this is partially implemented already).\r\n\r\n- When building apps that have previously been built, the build project is deleted and re-created again. Which also means a complete build is required again. This can be avoided by retaining the existing project and old copy over changes that have been made. Requiring only a partial rebuild.\r\n\r\n- If the app already exists on the phone, we should attempt to make use of the {{update}} command in the deploy tool. This should be must faster than the two step process of {{uninstall}} and {{install}}.",
