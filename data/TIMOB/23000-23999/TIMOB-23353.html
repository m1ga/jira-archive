<h3>Description</h3>

Both via CLI and Studio does it find and properly start the emulators but once the app has been built and the emulator finished booting, it fails saying:

<code><pre>
[INFO]  Finished building the application in 1m 6s 308ms
[INFO]  Waiting for Windows Phone emulator to finish booting
[ERROR] Failed to start emulator "10-0-2"

[ERROR] Failed to connect to Mobile Emulator 10.0.10586.0 WVGA 4 inch 1GB
</pre></code>

Building to device works fine.

   This seems to be some environment issue and not Titanium specific as I get a (different) error when building a default Visual Studio project to the same emulator as well:

   Any clues?</li>

   If the emulator has gotten into a bad state, you may need to just "delete" the entry from Hyper-V Manager app and then try deploying to it to get it recreated again.</li>

   Tried that but didn't help. Probably not a Titanium issue though as I can't deploy an app from Visual Studio either:

   Closing this for now, because this ticket is outdated. (I'm cleaning up our "old" tickets). We are effectively integrating emulator with Jenkins now. If this is still the case, please new open new ticket.
