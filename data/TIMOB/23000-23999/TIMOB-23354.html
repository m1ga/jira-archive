<h3>Description</h3>

Using code like the following, our app creates an overlay View then opens the camera. Even though we have showControls set to false, when users pinch to zoom, the zoom control is displayed.

<code><pre>
Ti.Media.showCamera({
  overlay: overlay.getView(),
  showControls: false,
  autohide: false,
  success: doCameraSuccess,
  cancel: doCameraCancel,
  error: doCameraError,
  saveToPhotoGallery: false,
  allowEditing: false,
  mediaTypes: Ti.Media.MEDIA_TYPE_PHOTO
});
</pre></code>

See the attached sample project (though this effect is seen whenever the camera is opened with an overlay)

   Hello, 
   
   I have tested the issue you have reported. I was able to reproduce the issue in iOS 9.2 device. I used the sample code you have provided. Not sure this should disable the zoom control or not. This is possibly a bug in the platform.

   <code>showControls</code> is equivalent to iOS native <code>UIImagePickerController:showCameraControls</code> so this is possibly a native issue. 
   [~apetkov] Can you create a native app in Xcode to verify if it's a native behavior?

   Although it's talking about a different bug, its <code>showCameraControls: false</code> yet the zoom control is seen in the screenshot. </li>

   This is indeed a native problem, i created a native application and the zoom bar still appears regardless.  I couldn't find any work-arounds or information about the issue by apple, there are some posts on stack [overflow](<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=Remove+Zoom+slider+in+UIImagePickerController)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=Remove+Zoom+slider+in+UIImagePickerController)</a> however all unanswered </li>
