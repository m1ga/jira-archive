<h3>Description</h3>

I couldn't understand why I wasn't getting the photo associated to my Custom Object created.
The API was always returning photo: {} which is an empty object.

Figured it out that when you use any query like <code>Cloud.Objects.query()</code> by default <code>response_json_depth</code>  set to <code>1</code> and even if I had a <code>Photos</code> object linked to my Custom Object, the API was returning:
<code><pre>
{
    "Vehicle": [
        {
            "name": "foo",
            "photo: {}
        }
    ]
}
</pre></code>
by setting <code>response_json_depth</code> to 3 I managed to have:
<code><pre>
{
    "Vehicle": [
        {
            "name": "foo",
            "photo: {
                "urls": {
                    "original": "<a href="http://bar.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://bar.com</a>"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
</pre></code>

so that’s one mystery solved but I think maybe a warning message into the documentation to point people into that direction when checking the <code>photo</code> attribute on the Custom Object for example would help.
Maybe something around those lines:
{quote}
Warning: if you are trying to fetch attributes which should have child objects like photo, be aware that you'll need to increase response_json_depth otherwise photo attribute will always return an empty Object.

   Well not sure... everywhere there is the ability to retrieve a multi level JSON object as a response from the API I would say.
   Or every time you mention a relationship to a another object...</li>
