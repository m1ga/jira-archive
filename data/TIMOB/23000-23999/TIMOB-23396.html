<h3>Description</h3>

When comparing the payloads for the Windows platform to Android, it was found that there are differences in the returned <code>timezone</code>:

*Windows:* <code>-420</code>
*Android:* <code>-480</code>

Phones were verified to have the correct time configured prior to obtaining the payloads.

<h4>Steps to Reproduce</h4>

1) Install a titanium project on a windows phone device
2) Launch the app
3) Use either - a) point device to staging via DNS setting, check logs. b) Use get last event api c) If you have backend access, check the raw event on AWS.
4) Examine any of the standard event types.

<h4>Actual Result</h4>

Timezone results are different for Windows & Android platforms.

<h4>Expected Result</h4>

Timezone results should be the same for Windows & Android platforms.

   Given those values, Windows is reporting 7 hours behind UTC (or what PDT is now). Android is reporting 8 hours behind UTC (or PST, which is _not_ the current timezone). I'm guessing this is a daylight savings issue?</li>
