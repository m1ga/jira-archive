   Hello, 
   
   Thanks for sharing your thoughts. This would be a nice addition to our platform. For that, this needs to be approved by our selection committee. We will let you know if and when we will integrate this into our platform. It is appreciated if you have any further reference to this feature in native platform. 
   
   Regards,
   Sharif.</li>

   Great feature enhancement! We are investigating this to see what will need to be done to support this.</li>

   Has this issue been discussed yet internally?</li>

   I'm very interested in Android Instant Apps and I was also wondering if this has been discussed internally. This may be the future of mobile development. Instant apps are now available for all developers to use rather than just invited testers.

   There would be nice to have an estimate on when you guys intend to add this feature to the sdk.
   It will definitely improve users' adoption to our apps.
   It's also available for many countries already:

   This feature isn't possible with our current implementation of Titanium. V8 is ~15MB in size and Instant Apps have a 4MB size limit which includes all app resources.</li>

   Adding my voice to hope this can happen soon</li>

   I too would really enjoy seeing this feature. I think it would greatly increase app exposure in Google Play and get more people testing our apps, then converting to downloading them after.</li>

   Any progress on this ticket?

   Now Google Play Instant provides maximum app size of up to 10MB.</li>
<li>Darius G 2019-01-02

    Waiting for this! Any progress?</li>
<li>Ray Belisle 2019-01-02

    At the moment, you can stop hoping for instant app support. There is a 4mb limit for instant apps and with the V8 engine requirement for appc (more than 4mb on its own), I don't believe that it will be possible with the current architecture and Google limitations.</li>
