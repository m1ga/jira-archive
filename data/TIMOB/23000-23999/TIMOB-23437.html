   Can't we get the most of that using the <code>[transform](<a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#</a>!/api/Titanium.UI.View-property-transform)</code> property?</li>

   on iOS you can use a 3dmatrix, which supports all of this. But on Android you only have a 2Dmatrix and its very slow when you apply it, not sure about the iOS speed. It is a straight forward way to set the properties (just use view.rotationY = value; ) and you don't have to create a matrix first. Perhaps you can map view.rotationX to a 3Dmatrx? </li>

   Yes, that would be the cleanest way. Basically we would have a 3DMatrix reference in our TiViewProxy that would be changed and applied with this properties. But as people on iOS can already use the matrix directly, the prio will remain "Medium" for now.</li>
