<h3>Description</h3>

In attempting to set up an automated test suite for Android, I'm running into an issue whereby I cannot reliably spit the test results as JSON due to a number of issues. If I try to gather them all together and spit out on huge JSOn object, I run into TIMOB-23438 where it gets truncated around 4036 characters.

If I try to spit out JSON results after every test, I get intermittent truncated output, thereby breaking the JSON parsing.

When I do a manual <code>adb logcat</code> it always shows the full JSON output in the logs, however, the titanium CLI is truncating it for some reason.

   [~cwilliams] can you suggest a way to test this? it'll be good for QE as well.</li>

   [~cwilliams] as suggested by Kiat, are there test steps that you can provide so I can assist in testing it out?</li>
