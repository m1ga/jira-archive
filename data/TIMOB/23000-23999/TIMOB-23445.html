<h3>Description</h3>

Right now if the red error controller is displayed we block opening other modal dialogs or new windows/views. This causes an issue with our unit tests because it means one failed test can fail any of the UI tests. The code is written in a way that we won't show the error controller if the deploy type is set to "production", but "production" is set as invalid value for a simulator or device launch.

Even if we could set deploy type to "production", that doesn't seem like the right fix for this (we still want other flags set for development like not minifying or encrypting the JS).
