<h3>Description</h3>

I have the shell script for automatic creation build for iOS and Android but when the build script finished independently whether will finished with some error or success the returned code is always zero.

For example:

~$ appc ti build --platform ios --project-dir "/mylocalWorkspace" -T dist-appstore --sdk "TitaniumSDK" -R "someCertificate" -P "someProvisioningProfile"
~$ echo $?

*EXPECTATION*
 When build finished with some error the script always returns code different than zero, that means success finishing.

   Hello, 
   
   Can you explain a little more. Is the "appc ti build" is not working in your case? I tested is my environment, and I was able to run project. Also, use "appc run" is working for me.  Can you send us the error log when you run the command?

   Hi Sharif,
   Thanks a lot for your support.
   
   First of all the command "appc ti build" works correct, but my problem is that I have shell script for automatically creation build through Jenkins. Therefore, I wont to catch the errors and to stop the preparation of build if some part of the scripts fail.
   
   Actually If you're familiar with writing shell script, it is known that with "$?" you can checking the exit status of some command, and according this, the command for building:
   
   _~$ appc ti build --platform ios --project-dir "/mylocalWorkspace" -T dist-appstore --sdk "TitaniumSDK" -R "someCertificate" -P "someProvisioningProfile"
   
   //Print the exit status
   ~$ echo $?_
   
    always returns same exit code equal on zero, independently if this command finish successfully or some error occur. 
   
   You can see this if manually make some error (for example write incorrect Titanium SDK in inpput params, or create build with not registered application etc.)
   
   Best Regards,
   Vladimir.</li>
