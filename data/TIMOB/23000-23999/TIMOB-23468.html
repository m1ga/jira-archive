<h3>Description</h3>

For the stable release, we should stick to best practices and not deliver new software that has deprecated dependencies. In our case, we currently use (both) wrench 1.5.8 and 1.5.9 as well as graceful 1.2.3

<code><pre>
npm WARN deprecated wrench@1.5.9: wrench.js is deprecated! You should check out fs-extra (<a href="https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra)</a> for any operations you were using wrench for. Thanks for all the usage over the years.
npm WARN deprecated wrench@1.5.8: wrench.js is deprecated! You should check out fs-extra (<a href="https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra)</a> for any operations you were using wrench for. Thanks for all the usage over the years.
npm WARN deprecated graceful-fs@1.2.3: graceful-fs v3.0.0 and before will fail on node releases >= v7.0. Please update to graceful-fs@^4.0.0 as soon as possible. Use 'npm ls graceful-fs' to find it in the tree.
</pre></code>

So proposal: Remove wrench with fs-extra (which has a 90 % same API) and upgrade graceful-fs to 4.0.0. We need to check the ocurrences and use-cases related to their calls, but it should not be too hard to replace.

   While the original description is no longer relevant the used node packages should be updated throughout the project.
   
   Used package.json files that require updating:
   * android/hooks/package.json
   * iphone/hooks/package.json
   * packages/hyperloop-ios-metabase/package.json (not used anymore, leaving untouched)
   * package.json</li>

   [~spulipakkam], I agree with Jan, it has been released already. We didn't see any issues during smokes. I'll close it.</li>
