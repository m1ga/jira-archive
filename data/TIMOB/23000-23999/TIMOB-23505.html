<h3>Description</h3>

When running the mocha test suite locally the application logs for the iOS/iPhone simulator sometimes just don't connect at all on short suites. And if I make the test suite we run long enough, it may "delay" showing the actual logs from Ti.API until we're far into the test run. We effectively totally drop the initial set of logs (and for our mocha test suite that means dropping information on tests that have been run).

   There were a couple issues in node-ios-device, one namely was a timing issue with starting the syslog relay service. This was all fixed in node-ios-device v0.9.5 which was updated in ioslib v0.11.0 which is already in TiSDK 5.4.0, but missed the 5.3.0 code freeze.</li>
