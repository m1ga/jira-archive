<h3>Description</h3>

I receive errors when trying to build when using Xcode 8.0.
Building for simulators (iOS 8.4, 9.0, and 10), I get this:
<code><pre>
[INFO] :   Launching iOS Simulator
[ERROR] :  Failed to parse app's Info.plist: /Users/Eric/Documents/Appcelerator_Studio_Workspace/xcodeagain/build/iphone/build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/xcodeagain.app/Info.plist
</pre></code>

And building to device, I see this:
<code><pre>
[ERROR] :  Error details: Bundle identifier is missing. newxcodetest doesn't have a bundle identifier for the Debug build configuration. Add a value for PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER in the build settings editor.
[ERROR] :  Error details: Code signing is required for product type 'Application' in SDK 'iOS 10.0'
</pre></code>

*Steps to reproduce issue*
1. Create a new project: <code>appc new</code>
2. Run the project: <code>cd <project_path></code>, <code>appc run</code>

*Expected Results*
The project builds and runs without issue

*Actual Results*
The above errors are encountered and the project will not run

   Attaching an Info.plist from an afflicted project.</li>
<li>Chee Kiat Ng 2016-06-14

   I"m only able to reproduce this on studio.
   But my appc cli is working fine though. 
   [~kkolipaka] probably should start investigating too.</li>
<li>Wilson Luu 2016-06-14

   I can also reproduce this issue from CLI with Xcode 8.0 beta (8S128d) with:
   
   Appc CLI NPM: 4.2.7-2
   Appc CLI Core: 5.4.0-15
   Arrow: 1.7.31
   SDK: 5.4.0.v20160608165242
   Node: v4.4.5
   OS: El Capitan (10.11.5)
   </li>
<li>Chee Kiat Ng 2016-06-14

   Weird!
   
   Appc CLI NPM: 4.2.7-2
   Appc CLI Core: 5.3.1-2
   Arrow: 1.7.31
   SDK: 5.4.0.v20160519143319
   Node: v4.2.2
   OS: El Capitan (10.11.5)
   
   i can't reproduce on CLI with Xcode 8.0</li>
<li>Chee Kiat Ng 2016-06-14

   Attached 2 screenshots of the difference between a studio built Xcode project, and a cli built Xcode project. 
   Key differences here include:
   - info.plist is much less than the correct one
   - Automatically enable provisioning is disabled / enabled
   - Identity fields are missing
   
   This is not necessarily a studio issue since wilson and eric can reproduce in CLI.
   
   [~cbarber] thoughts on what may have possibly gone wrong?
   </li>
<li>Chris Barber 2016-06-14

   In Xcode 7, Apple started moving certain settings to environment variables such as <code>${PRODUCT_NAME}</code>, but these are not necessary. We should be able to continue to inline settings.
   
   Secondly, I also see the <code>Failed to parse app's Info.plist</code> error when building from the CLI using Xcode 8 beta + Titanium CLI (master) + Titanium SDK (master). In the past this we've seen this error, but it was because the file was completely missing. On my machine, the file is indeed there, has the correct permissions, and not malformed. The file looks correct and opens fine in Xcode.
   
   One thing I noticed is the coding signing part of the output:
   
   <code><pre>
   [TRACE] Signing Identity:     "-"
   [TRACE]     /usr/bin/codesign --force --sign - --timestamp=none /Users/chris/appc/workspace/testapp/build/iphone/build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/testapp.app
   </pre></code>
   
   The signing identity is basically empty, so I suspect we just need to add this and things will work.</li>
<li>Chee Kiat Ng 2016-06-14

   [~cbarber] how do we add this?</li>
<li>Hans Kn√∂chel 2016-06-14

   Note from Xcode 8: There is "Provisioning Profiles (Deprecated)" and "Provisioning Profiles" [(Screen)](<a href="https://abload.de/img/bildschirmfoto2016-06vokyl.png)." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://abload.de/img/bildschirmfoto2016-06vokyl.png).</a> If we check the raw values, it shows the following keys that differ:
   <code><pre>
   PROVISIONING_PROFILE = ""; // Old key
   "PROVISIONING_PROFILE[sdk=iphoneos*]" = ""; // New key
   </pre></code>
   as well as
   <code><pre>
   PROVISIONING_PROFILE = ""; // Old key
   PROVISIONING_PROFILE_SPECIFIER = ""; // New key
   </pre></code></li>
<li>Chris Barber 2016-06-14

   Adding <code>PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER</code> doesn't fix it for sim builds. Furthermore, I can't get <code>PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER</code> to stick. When the Titanium iOS build injects it, Xcode doesn't read it when opening the project file. However, if I set it via Xcode, it will stick. No idea. No typos. It's weird.
   
   For the provisioning profiles, there is no <code>PROVISIONING_PROFILE\[sdk=iphoneos*\]</code>. Adding it causes the Xcode project to be invalid.
   
   I added <code>PROVISIONING_PROFILE_SPECIFIER</code> and now device builds finish successfully, however the output ipa app is invalid. Need to do more investigating.
   
   Despite <code>PROVISIONING_PROFILE</code> being deprecated, we still need to set it for older Xcode versions. It's harmless to have both the old <code>PROVISIONING_PROFILE</code> and new <code>PROVISIONING_PROFILE_SPECIFIER</code>.
   
   Another change which is rather big is <code>PROVISIONING_PROFILE_SPECIFIER</code> must be in the format <code><TEAM_ID>/<PROVISIONING PROFILE UUID></code>. We already have code for handling team IDs, but it's only for App Groups to be allow iOS apps and WatchOS apps to talk to each other. Now we will REQUIRE the team ID to be specified in the tiapp.xml or prompted by the CLI. This will be a bit of work and Studio will probably have to provide a dropdown in the tiapp.xml editor to make it easier to specify the team ID since the team ID is not easy to remember.</li>
<li>Ingo Muschenetz 2016-06-14

    [~cb1kenobi] I know this is a break from your daemon work, but I think it would be worthwhile taking a small break to fix this and unblock iOS development/testing.</li>
<li>Chee Kiat Ng 2016-06-16

    [~cbarber] I solved the mystery (sort of).
    After much investigation, i came to the conclusion that our xcodebuild command is behaving differently from building from Xcode itself, on the same titanium generated project (with the right info plist). The info.plist only got mutated when we run xcodebuild cli.
    Therefore, i continued to think it may be something to do with the flag arguments we pass into xcodebuild. 
    Lo and Behold, if you comment this out:
    <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/blob/master/iphone/cli/commands/_build.js#L5938" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/blob/master/iphone/cli/commands/_build.js#L5938</a>
    
    The titanium app will build and launch successfully (with no mutated info.plist). And also, i tried changing the derived data path in Xcode->preferences, it still works no matter if it's relative or absolute.
    
    So either the behavior of -derivedDataPath changed, or it's something else I'm not sure. I'll bring it up to the Apple Xcode team on friday during their lab session.</li>
<li>Chris Barber 2016-06-16

    [~cng] I figured out the mystery of the simulator not launching. When launching the simulator and installing an app, we need the app id to be able to launch the app. During the huge refactor when watch support was added, we also needed to support the watch app's id. Instead of passing this in, ioslib detects the app id and watch app id from the Info.plist in the app directory that is passed in.
    
    This means it's looking for a key called <code>CFBundleIdentifier</code> in the Info.plist. If this value is missing, it errors out.
    
    The problem is when Xcode 8 compiles the Info.plist, it strips the CFBundleIdentifier from the final Info.plist in the <code>build/iphone/build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/<appname>.app/</code>. Why did Apple do this? Is this a bug? Security issue?
    
    ----
    
    The modified Info.plist in the <code>build/iphone</code> directory does not impact clean builds, but it will impact subsequent builds. We need to find out why the Info.plist is being modified. Why did <code>-derivedDataPath</code> change? Is there a bug?</li>
<li>Chee Kiat Ng 2016-06-16

    [~cbarber] They told me to file a bug for <code>-derivedDataPath</code>. They it's most likely a bug on their end. I have filed bug.</li>
<li>Chris Barber 2016-06-16

    [~cng] Can you also ask why <code>CFBundleIdentifier</code> is no longer in the Info.plist?</li>
<li>Chee Kiat Ng 2016-06-16

    
    [~cbarber] well. they are saying since that flag corrupts the info.plist to ground zero, so that maybe why that key is missing (together with the others). Because in a new Xcode 8 project, the CFBundleIdentifier is there.
    
    If i mis-interpreted what you are saying, can you give me a reproducible case to show them?</li>
<li>Chris Barber 2016-06-16

    [~cng] The iOS build writes the correct <code>build/iphone/Info.plist</code>, then <code>xcodebuild</code> compiles it and outputs the compiled Info.plist into <code>build/iphone/build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/<appname>.app/</code> while also rewriting the correct <code>build/iphone/Info.plist</code> with a bad Info.plist.
    
    The problem is the compiled Info.plist <code>build/iphone/build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/<appname>.app/Info.plist</code> has everything except the <code>CFBundleIndentifier</code>. If you can reproduce that Info.plist error for sim builds, then just go open the compiled Info.plist and you'll see the <code>CFBundleIdentifier</code> is missing.</li>
<li>Chee Kiat Ng 2016-06-16

    Woa. it's worse than just a missing CFBundleIdentifier. the info.plist is completely different.

    No <code>CFBundleIdentifier</code>. :(</li>
<li>Chee Kiat Ng 2016-06-16

    i have updated the bug reporter in apple accordingly.
    Shouldn't it worry you that the other keys are like...wierd</li>
<li>Chris Barber 2016-06-16

    Um, weird in what way? Looks like an Info.plist to me.</li>
<li>Chee Kiat Ng 2016-06-17

    so i guess we have to wait for apple to respond or their next beta release? Is it an issue if we remove -derivedDataPath entirely? i tried that, the build and everything seem pretty ok. [~cbarber]</li>
<li>Chris Barber 2016-06-17

    [~cng] Yep, we have to wait. I don't think we should remove <code>-derivedDataPath</code>. We need to override the global Xcode settings.
    
    As for the team and provisioning profile handling, I like the idea of moving away from provisioning profile uuids, but I'm not entire sure yet how we should handle things, especially with maintaining backwards compatibility with Xcode 7.
    
    Here's the PR with what I've got so far which includes all the team id changes: <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/8072." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/8072.</a></li>
<li>Chee Kiat Ng 2016-07-07

    [~cbarber] So I tried this again with Xcode 8 beta 2, but it still fails.
    HOWEVER, I discovered that, it's not entirely Xcode 8's fault for over-writing the info.plist. because I can sort of reproduce this using Xcode 7.3.1.
    
    Basically, <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/blob/master/iphone/cli/commands/_build.js#L5938" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/blob/master/iphone/cli/commands/_build.js#L5938</a>
    the arg <code>-derivedDataPath</code> *IS* supposed to produce an info.plist and a ModuleCache folder.
    So in our cli we specified <code>-derivedDataPath</code> to be the buildDir, where an info.plist already exist. We were lucky in Xcode 7.3.1 Apple was smart enough to say, hey your flag tells me to put an info.plist here, but you already have one, so i'll skip doing that. Whereas in Xcode 8, Apple decided hey your flag tells me to put an info.plist here, so I'm just doing as I'm told and i'll overwrite anything you have here.
    
    SO, we just need to change the <code>derivedDataPath</code> to somewhere else and all will work, in Xcode 7.3.1 and in Xcode 8. But I think something else need to change so that it still does incremental builds.</li>

    <h4>Steps to Test</h4>
    1. *appc new*
    2. *appc run -p ios -I 10.0*
    
    <h4>Expected Result</h4>
    Builds and runs normally
    
    Additional Tests
    1. Repeat *appc run -p ios -I 10.0 -l trace*, it should be incrementally built (you can tell from the speed it builds, as well as looking in the trace)
    2. Test on device
    3. Test on both Xcode 7.3.1 and on Xcode 8</li>

    I can't seem to reproduce your issue. 
    I tried appc cli 5.3.1 and Ti SDK latest master.
    Can you try *appc use 5.4.0-37* and try again.</li>

    I am not quite sure. So you are saying it works if you do *-I 9.3* instead of *-I 10.0*?</li>
<li>Henry David Spells III 2016-08-08

    Actually I get the same result with -I 9.3</li>

    [~dspells]If that's the case you might want to create a new ticket for your particular problem , which i suspect is appc cli related.

    Creating a new project and running that works. After I created a new project and then came back to my existing project, it seems to work now also with 5.4.0-37/6.0.0.v20160807124019. Thank you.</li>

    I know this is "closed" and "fixed" (famous last words) but just updated to 5.50 GA SDK and 4.7.1 Studio and building a very simple old project that had no problems before upgrading to Xcode 8..
    
    [INFO] :   Invoking xcodebuild
    [INFO] :   Finished building the application in 40s 999ms

<li>Joe Falcone 2016-09-14

    Please disregard my comment - it does work with 8A218a.</li>
<li>Chris Barber 2016-09-14

    [~jfalcone] We've seen this happen intermittently with Xcode 8 GM seed, however we can't reproduce it consistently. Usually cleaning the project and building again fixes it.
    
    Are you just building with iOS 10 and Xcode 8 or are you switching between iOS 9 and 10? The CoreSimulator services for Xcode 7 and Xcode 8 are different and they get swapped automatically, however it's possible for the swap to be flaky. Usually rebuilding solves it.
    
    Another possible cause, which is related to the above, happens when we clean the derived data. Sometimes the <code>xcodebuild clean</code> command crashes. I suspect it's an Xcode bug.
    
    I'll continue to keep an eye on this and hopefully fix it. Please let me know if you stumble across any additional information. Thanks!</li>
<li>Joe Falcone 2016-09-14

    It may have been intermittent but it works now (several times in a row) so I'm satisfied that it is OK.</li>
<li>Amanda 2016-09-16

    I am encountering this error as well. Can someone please help me fix this? how do i get the fix?</li>
<li>Chee Kiat Ng 2016-09-16

    Hi, you have to use titanium sdk 5.5.0 and preferably app cli</li>
<li>Ianko Leite 2016-09-16

    I am also getting the same error. It's not a new project (not created using <code>appc new</code> using CLI 5.5), but it is a version that works fine with APPC CLI 5.4 and Xcode 7. I did followed the instructions on this post: <a href="http://www.appcelerator.com/blog/2016/09/ga-release-for-titanium-sdk-5-5-0-appcelerator-cli-5-5-0-appcelerator-studio-4-7-1/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.appcelerator.com/blog/2016/09/ga-release-for-titanium-sdk-5-5-0-appcelerator-cli-5-5-0-appcelerator-studio-4-7-1/</a>

    [~ianko] I am assuming you did a clean project before this? And is it working on simulator?</li>

    I did clean my project before everything.
    
    My project has a particular module that does not include the necessary libraries targeted to run on simulator. Just devices.</li>
<li>Chee Kiat Ng 2016-09-17

    It'll help if you could 
    1. run *appc run -p ios -I 10.0 -T device -l trace* and let us take a look at the trace for more error information. 
    2. Try to run a new project on simulator and device with this exact environment just to make sure there's nothing wrong.</li>
<li>Ianko Leite 2016-09-17

    1. Where can I send this log without exposing my data here?
    
    2. Created a new project using <code>appc new</code> and it ran on simulator but not on device. Same kind of error:

    [~eric.harms@gmail.com] That error is unrelated to this ticket. Please create a new ticket with your environment and steps to reproduce. We can then take a look and keep track of it. Thank you.</li>

    Chris -- Im a bit confused, as my error is exactly what the error is that started this thread, but I will open another ticket.
    
    Thanks!</li>
<li>Chris Barber 2016-09-20

    [~eric.harms@gmail.com] Doh! I was thinking the <code>Info.plist</code> missing issue. Sorry! My bad.
    
    Can you confirm that you are getting the missing bundle identifier for device builds, sim builds, or both?</li>
<li>eric harms 2016-09-20

    no worries :)
    
    i can confirm missing bundle id on device builds, info.plist error on sim builds.
    
    My project was created well before 5.5.0.GA if that matters, but if I create a new project I get the same errors.
    
    Heres my environment details, let me know if you need any more info
    
    Mac OS X 10.11.5
    Node.js Version 0.12.7
    npm Version 2.11.3
    Titanium CLI Version 5.0.9
    node-appc Version 0.2.31
    5.5.0.GA
    8.0 (build 8A218a) - Xcode default
        iOS SDKs                  = 10.0
        iOS Simulators            = 10.0
        Watch SDKs                = 3.0
        Watch Simulators          = 3.0

    [~capsizeno4] What appc-cli version are you using? Are you seeing this error on both simulator and device? If you don't mind, having a copy of the full trace log and maybe your tiapp.xml (without the guid or sensitive information) may help us help you. </li>
<li>Jonas Tornqvist 2016-09-21

    I just updated to xcode 8 and have the same problem</li>
<li>eric harms 2016-09-21

    Chee --

    Titanium CLI
      CLI Version                 = 5.0.9
      node-appc Version           = 0.2.31
    
    when I Ti info
    
    I dont mind sending you a log including my ti info -- ill email you
    
    Thanks

<li>eric harms 2016-09-21

    Chee -- send you my log and my tiapp.xml via email.
    
    Also -- im getting this error when i build to an ios10 device.
    
    when i build to the sim i get the info.plist error that is talked about through this thread.
    
    Thanks

    Chee --
    
    Just wanted to make sure you got all my log files I sent this morning, and if so if you had any thoughts on what might be causing the issue.
    
    Thanks!

<li>Chris Barber 2016-09-21

    [~eric.harms@gmail.com], [~Pandan] I cannot for the life of me reproduce either the Simulator build error with the <code>Info.plist</code> or the device build error with the bundle identifier. I've tried many different things and no luck. Everything works as expected.
    
    Please give me precise steps to reproduce.</li>
<li>eric harms 2016-09-21

    Chris,
    
    I wish I was having your luck!  For me, Im running my project that Ive been running for the past 9 months to get the bundle id error on the device -- and i just created a new project to get the plist.info error.
    
    Did Chee share my logs and tiapp.xml with you?  I emailed them to him early this morning. It has my ti info in it as well, maybe something in there will shed a light 
    
    Thanks
    Eric

<li>Chee Kiat Ng 2016-09-21

    [~capsizeno4] I have received your logs and tiapp.xml. Basically, you didn't set the titanium sdk to 5.5.0.GA, but instead you are still using 5.3.1.GA..... 5.5.0.GA is the only SDK that supports Xcode 8 currently.
    Looking at your trace file, this sentence indicates that you are using the wrong sdk.
    <code>[INFO]  tiapp.xml <sdk-version> set to 5.3.1.GA, but current Titanium SDK set to 5.4.0.GA</code>
    And looking at your tiapp.xml, i believe if you change this:
        <sdk-version>5.3.1.GA</sdk-version>
    to
        <sdk-version>5.5.0.GA</sdk-version>
    And probably clean the project before building, your problem will be solved.</li>
<li>Mike Neill 2016-09-25

    The solution provided for Chee worked for me. However, I do want to say it's very unclear that the SDK is the issue here. I would recommend adding a better error message that tells the user to update their SDK version. Also, you all should have a way to automatically update these settings. If you see a developer is building with the latest iOS SDK, then perhaps you should prompt them to update their SDK as well. Small annoyances such as these is what drive people away from a platform.</li>
<li>Hans Kn√∂chel 2016-09-25

    [~miken01] I agree, but how could we add an error-warning to a previously releases version that does not know about releases that may effect it in the future? :-) So again: Upgrading the SDK and CLI using <code>appc setup</code> or checking updates in Studio is the safest way to receive product- and compatibility-updates.</li>
<li>Mike Neill 2016-09-25

    Hans, I completely understand what you're saying. However, in this case the error message could have been bundled within the Appcelerator Studio update, which I did install via "Check for Updates". You could also build a framework within the Android Studio to check for release notes and provide detailed information based on that. I'm not suggesting you modify the SDK as much as the tool that people are consuming to utilize the SDK. Such how Xcode has it's own built-in warnings and converters to ensure developers are marching their code forward.
    
    Thanks for the reply :)</li>
<li>eric harms 2016-09-26

    Chee, Hans, Chris
    
    Setting the correct SDK 5.5.0.GA for XCode8 in my tiapp.xml was the correct answer.  I swear that was the first thing I tried,  but obviously I did not.
    
    Thanks for the help!

    I'm experiencing a similar issue and assume it is the same thing. I've checked my SDK though and it's correct.  I've created a completely fresh app with <code>appc new</code>.

<li>Chee Kiat Ng 2016-10-09

    [~killroyboy] it's a different problem what you are facing. The error log is different. yours is talking about some provisioning profile. Can you check on that? Or provide more details than this? what flags did you use when calling <code>appc run</code>? did you select the correct provisioning profiles? </li>
<li>Dan Wilson 2016-10-10

    @cng The provisioning profile is managed by Xcode. It was working fine before I upgraded to Xcode8. 
    
    Here's my appc run command:
    
    <code><pre>appc run -p ios -T device -s 5.5.1.GA</pre></code>
    
    I've tried to use different SDK versions with no luck. I also reinstalled Xcode8.  Is there no way for us to control the signing settings? Everything I've seen dealing with this (using native iOS/swift development) involves changing the signing settings to resolve the problem.</li>
<li>Chris Barber 2016-10-10

    [~killroyboy] Specifying the SDK (<code>\-s, \-\-sdk</code>) at the command line has no effect. You must put the SDK version you want to use in the <code>tiapp.xml</code>. Secondly, if you have multiple Xcode versions installed, you should explicitly specify <code>\-\-ios\-version 10.0</code>.</li>
<li>Dan Wilson 2016-10-10

    Chris, it is indicated in the tiapp.xml. I was just trying to pass it on the command line as well to see if that changed anything. I don't have multiple Xcode's installed, but I tried your suggestion with the same result.</li>
<li>Chris Barber 2016-10-10

    [~killroyboy] Well, apparently you can't use the Xcode generated provisioning profiles. Try creating a new provisioning profile in the Apple Developer website, then use that one. I'll have to investigate why we can't use the generated provisioning profiles.</li>
