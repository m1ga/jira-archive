<h3>Description</h3>

Faced orientation issue on Android as well as iOS device when we open the share dialog in the application.
I have created an application to share a text message with friends, using applications installed on  the device.
I have locked the application's orientation to portrait from tiapp.xml as well as a set the orientationModes of the window to [Ti. UI. PORTRAIT].
I have tried setting the screenOrientation for Android as a "portrait" as well as "nosensor", but none of them work.
Facing orientation issue only after opening the share dialog.
For Android device, I have used intent to share text and for IOS device, I have used module to share text.
I have also created a native IOS application and did not face this issue in a native application.
Let me know your feedback on this issue.

   Hello, 
   
   Thanks for creating the ticket. Please provide a full reproducible code that successfully generate the issue in both platforms. We will test the issue in our environment and when we are able to regenerate, I will escalate the ticket for our engineers for a bug fix. So, we need a reproducible test case. Please provides a minimal sample code that only generates the issue. Also, a list of steps to follow for successful regeneration.
   
   Regards,
   Sharif.</li>

   Hi Sharif,
   
   Attaching the Appcelerator project to share a text.
   
   Steps to follow:
   * Enter a text in the textfield.
   * Click on "share text" button.
   * Rotate the device to the landscape mode.
   
   For Android device, the issue occurs when we open an application which does not occupy the entire display and rotate the device to the landscape mode.</li>

   Hello, Looks like you are using an old SDK. We have the latest GA release on SDK 5.3.0 GA. I have tested your sample app in Android platform with that said SDK. I wasn't able to reproduce the issue. I have tested in Android 4.4.2 device. I have screenshots of my test.

   I would recommend updating your SDK to the latest GA release. </li>

   Hi Sharif,
   
   I tried with SDK 5.3.0 GA. And facing the same issue on 5.3.0 GA.
   For Android device, facing the issue for those applications which does not occupy the entire screen. If we rotate the device after opening an application which does not occupy the entire screen, then our application in the background also goes to landscape mode.</li>

   My main concern is for the IOS application as issue can be easily reproducible on IOS device.
   Can you please update me about the issue in IOS application?</li>

   Hello, I have tested it on iOS  with the latest SDK. The issue looks to be happening for iOS. This is a valid bug for iOS. My environment info: SDK: 5.3.0.GA , Appcelerator Command-Line Interface, version 5.3.0 , iPod 5G (9.2).

   [~yashrevandkar] Hello, was this working with any previous versions of the SDK? Since this isn't a [module](<a href="https://github.com/VincentWenShuo/ti-module-share)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/VincentWenShuo/ti-module-share)</a> created or maintained by Appcelerator, if the problem lays within the module you will need to contact the module creator. </li>

   Hi,
   
   To check if the problem lies within the module, I have created an IOS module and still facing the same orientation issue.
   When I created an IOS application with the same code, it is working fine and not facing such orientation issue in IOS application.
   </li>
<li>Hans Kn√∂chel 2016-09-24

    Resolving as <code>Not Our Bug</code> for now, since the orientation problems are obviously caused by the thirdparty-module around [this line](<a href="https://github.com/VincentWenShuo/ti-module-share/blob/master/Classes/MaCarTiModuleShareModule.m#L194)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/VincentWenShuo/ti-module-share/blob/master/Classes/MaCarTiModuleShareModule.m#L194)</a>, because the created view controller does not check the orientation before being presented. The module vendor needs to take care of the issue.</li>

    Closing ticket as the issue mentioned here is not our bug.</li>
