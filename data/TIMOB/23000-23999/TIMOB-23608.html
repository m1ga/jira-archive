   Hello, 
   
   I believe this is iOS default behavior when a text is selected it shows these options. iOS has this feature natively. If iOS does not allow this we can't provide this feature either. If this is possible in native platform, Please provide the link and iOS official documentation guide on how this is handled in iOS. We will consider this as a new feature request once sufficient data is provided. 
   
   Regards,
   Sharif.</li>

   Hello,
   thanks for reply.
   
   looks this is possible in iOS Native platform. most of the reading application hides the copy option for the content security. 
   
   please check,  below is the image of one of the iOS Native application for your reference

   Hello, It would be better if you provide more information like iOS documentation reference about how this is handled. This might be done adding a key to plist. If that so, You can try adding them into projects iOS section of tiapp.xml file.

   Hello, As I said you need to provide sufficient native reference for a new feature to be included in the platform. Look into the native docs, see how it's done. provide sufficient reference for us to work on. </li>
