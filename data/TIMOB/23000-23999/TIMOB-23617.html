   [~sliang] Could you provide more device info? Eg. Exact Model number etc etc. 
   
   Also what settings or restrictions did they put in their Google Play store? Certain settings might prevent a user from downloading an app as well. eg Country restriction, etc etc.</li>

   Assuming that there isn't anything wrong with the settings as well as the phone, perhaps that particular device is in a weird state.

   Try clearing data from download manager (settings-apps-all) and play store, then remove your google account, then go to play store and it will ask you to link your account after that try downloading the app. (That worked for me).

   Without more information and a way to reproduce it, I can only give an educated guess. Please try the suggestion in the quote above.</li>
