   Based on that report, here's the SSL issues:
   
   Issue 3: This is used only in development. In Production, this class is not used.
   Issue 6: It's a feature to can be used to disable/ignore this.
   Issue 7: Same as Issue 3.
   Issue 8: We are using it for our bindings. This is already noted in the docs [<a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebView.html#addJavascriptInterface(java.lang.Object" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebView.html#addJavascriptInterface(java.lang.Object</a>, java.lang.String)]
   
   Please note, a number of the issues listed also include Facebook classes.
   
   The issues listed has a valid reason to be there and they've actually been noted before to not cause issues.
   
   Thanks for the report [~topener].</li>

   Perhaps issue 8 can have some improvements.
   Besides that, I'll resolve this issue as Won't Fix.</li>
