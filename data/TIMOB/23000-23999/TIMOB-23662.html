<h3>Description</h3>

Studio and CLI can't find the windows phone SDK, even in a clean install.
Other user had the same problem and, installing the Windows Phone emulator the problem was solved.
My problem is that I cannot install WP emulator because my CPU is old and doesn't has support for SLAT.

In another modern PC with SLAT and emulator installed, WP SDK is detected correctly.

Some screenshots provided.

I need WP SDK to be detected to be able to build for WP.

   Hey Gary, so I know this came up before where our tooling doesn't like it if you don't have the Phone emulators installed. While the workaround seems easy enough - install the emulators - some users simply cannot do so because their PCs don't support SLAT/Hyper-V. Given that they could still build and test on devices we should have our tooling support that scenario - SDK/tooling installed, but no phone emulators, letting them build and test on devices.</li>

   Investigating this, I have found this should be fixed in windowslib-0.4.15 by <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/windowslib/pull/48" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/windowslib/pull/48</a>
   
   Devices will only be found if their corresponding SDK is also installed; i.e: Windows 10 Mobile device will only be found if the Windows 10 SDK is installed.This is to prevent compiling against incompatible devices.</li>

   Hi Gary.
   
   Can I apply the patch manually to 5.3.1 SDK? I tried by simply overwriting the wptool.js but didn't work.</li>

   Verified using:
   
   Windows 10 Pro
   Appc CLI: 6.0.0-55
   Appc NPM: 4.2.8-7
   Ti SDK: 6.0.0.v20161002235150
   
   The below configurations now work
   
   * Windows 8.1 SDK only no emulators
   * Windows 10 and 8.1 SDK no emulators
   
   Currently Windows 10 SDK only does not work and errors when building to device TIMOB-23976
   
   Closing ticket</li>
