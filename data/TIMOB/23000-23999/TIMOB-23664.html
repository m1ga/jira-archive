<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Description</h4>

When building on a Windows system that has Windows Phone Emulators installed LiveView seems to always pick the <code>vEthernet (Internal Ethernet Port Windows Phone Emulator Internal Switch)</code> network connection meaning that devices are unable to connect to the liveview server as this is an internal network connection used solely for emulators

*Note*

I believe that ipv4 address for this adapter is always 169.254.80.80

*Workaround*

To workaround this issue, disable the switch in Network and Connections.

<h4>Go to Control Panel</h4>
<h4>Open Network and Sharing Centre</h4>
<h4>Click  Change adapter settings</h4>
<h4>Right click vEthernet and click Disable</h4>

*This will mean you will not be able to build for Windows Phone Emulators, be sure to enable this when you are finished*

<h4>Steps to reproduce</h4>

<h4>Ensure you have Windows Phone Emulators installed and that you see the vEthernet switch in Network Connections</h4>
<h4>Enable LiveView from Studio</h4>
<h4>Build for Android</h4>
<h4>Disable the vEthernet switch in Network and Connections</h4>
<h4>Build for Android</h4>

<h4>Actual result</h4>

At step 3 the LiveView connection will not be successful 

At step 5 the LiveView connection will be successful

<h4>Expected result</h4>

The LiveView connection should be successful in both cases

   [~cwilliams] any idea if this is a tooling or sdk ticket?</li>

   Verified fix, was able to use LiveView with the vEthernet network connection enabled and disabled. 
   
   *Environment*

   Phone : Nexus 6P
   Emulator: Android 6.0.0 ARM
   APPC studio version: 4.9.0.201701181905 (Nightly) 
   
   Operating System:
   Name                        = Microsoft Windows 10 Pro

   Architecture                = 32bit
   <h4>CPUs                      = 4</h4>

   The fix made for this ticket was reverted in <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/liveview/pull/99" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/liveview/pull/99</a> in favour of passing the IP via the means added in CLI-1075. Therefore I am closing this ticket as <code>Wont Fix</code>
   
   To do this
   
   <h4>From the CLI</h4>
   
   When building, pass in the <code>--liveview-ip &lt;IP&gt;</code> where IP is the IP address you wish to use. This option is in addition to the <code>--liveview</code> flag
   
   <h4>From Studio</h4>
   
   <h4>Open Preferences</h4>
   #* On MacOS <code>Appcelerator Studio -&gt; Preferences</code>
   #* On Windows <code>Windows -&gt; Preferences</code>
   <h4>Expand the Studio section</h4>
   <h4>Click LiveView</h4>
   <h4>Set the <code>LiveView Host</code> field as the IP you wish to use</h4>
   
   Generally, when building to a physical device on Windows the IP used should be the IP of the development machine, and when building to a Windows Mobile Emulator the IP address for <code>Internal Ethernet Port Windows Phone Emulator Internal Switch</code> should be used.</li>
