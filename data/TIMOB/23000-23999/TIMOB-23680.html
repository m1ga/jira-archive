   This looks serious. Can you verify the issue with Hyperloop 1.2.8 just to be sure? [~cng] Following [this arch-chart](<a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/DeviceInformation/Reference/iOSDeviceCompatibility/DeviceCompatibilityMatrix/DeviceCompatibilityMatrix.html)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/DeviceInformation/Reference/iOSDeviceCompatibility/DeviceCompatibilityMatrix/DeviceCompatibilityMatrix.html)</a> it should be reproducible on a iPhone 4S and iPhone 5C as well.</li>

   Unable to reproduce with Hyperloop 4.0.3. Closing.</li>
