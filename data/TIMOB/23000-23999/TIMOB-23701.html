<h3>Description</h3>

*This is a regression from 5.3.1.GA*

It was found that when opening a second window within an app, calling the <code>close()</code> method will actually close both windows. *This only occurs when <code>&lt;enable-launch-screen-storyboard&gt;</code> is set to TRUE, which is the default configuration.*

<h4>TEST CODE:</h4>
<code><pre>
Ti.UI.backgroundColor = "Black";

var win = Ti.UI.createWindow({backgroundColor:'blue'});

var open = Ti.UI.createButton({
	title: 'Open Window'	
});

var close = Ti.UI.createButton({
	title: 'Close Window'
});

open.addEventListener('click', function(){
	var win2 = Ti.UI.createWindow({backgroundColor:'green'});
	win2.add(close);
	close.addEventListener('click', function(){
		win2.close();
	});
	win2.open();
});

win.add(open);
win.open();
</pre></code>

Background: *Black*
{color:#205081}Window 1: *Blue*{color}
{color:#14892c}Window 2: *Green*{color}


<h4>Steps to Reproduce</h4>
1. Create a new Classic Mobile Project.
2. Copy above test code into app.js file.
3. Ensure that <code>&lt;enable-launch-screen-storyboard&gt;</code> is set to TRUE in the tiapp.xml.
4. Run App to device / sim.
5. Click on "Open Window" button, this will open a second green window.
6. Click on "Close Window" button, this will close the second green window.

<h4>Actual Result</h4>

Both {color:#205081}win1{color} & {color:#14892c}win2{color} are closed, revealing the black background.

<h4>Expected Result</h4>

Only {color:#14892c}win2{color} should be closed.

   From Harry:
   5.4.0.v20160720201924 was unaffected, So the causing factor would most likely be made somewhere between 20-25th</li>
<li>Hans Knöchel 2016-07-29

   Most probably caused by <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/8152" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/8152</a>, will check right now.</li>

   Verified as fixed, with the latest build this issue is no longer reproducible. However I've found that when opening and closing the window a couple of times, I receive the following DEBUG log: 
   <code><pre>
   [DEBUG] :  Window is not open. Ignoring this close call
   </pre></code>
   
   Additionally, the log count is incremented every time I cycle through Open / Close. For example after 5 cycles I receive the following:
   <code><pre>
   [DEBUG] :  Window is not open. Ignoring this close call
   [DEBUG] :  Window is not open. Ignoring this close call
   [DEBUG] :  Window is not open. Ignoring this close call
   [DEBUG] :  Window is not open. Ignoring this close call
   [DEBUG] :  Window is not open. Ignoring this close call
   [DEBUG] :  Window is not open. Ignoring this close call
   [DEBUG] :  Window is not open. Ignoring this close call
   [DEBUG] :  Window is not open. Ignoring this close call
   [DEBUG] :  Window is not open. Ignoring this close call
   [DEBUG] :  Window is not open. Ignoring this close call
   [DEBUG] :  Window is not open. Ignoring this close call
   [DEBUG] :  Window is not open. Ignoring this close call
   [DEBUG] :  Window is not open. Ignoring this close call
   [DEBUG] :  Window is not open. Ignoring this close call
   [DEBUG] :  Window is not open. Ignoring this close call
   </pre></code>

   [~htbryant] That is very important to know. Did that not happen prior to 5.4.0? And using what test-case? </li>
<li>Harry Bryant 2016-08-01

   [~hansknoechel] This issue doesn't occur with 5.3.1.GA. I've included the test case and reproducible steps in the created ticket: TIMOB-23711 . Additionally, checked to see if Storyboard set to <code>true</code> was causing the issue, but it occurs even when set to false.</li>
