<h3>Description</h3>

There are cases where 3rd-party JARs/AARs or user code may refer to libraries we already package/bundle with Titanium SDK, such as appcompatv7. Hyperloop should be able to handle that use case and generate JS wrappers and whatever is necessary for Hyperloop JS code to reference/use those libraries.

This is highly related to TIMOB-23697 as the user was intentionally adding the appcompatv7 JAR to try and workaround the issue of us not generating wrappers for the classes. That led to the duplicate argument to dexer breaking that command's execution.
