<h3>Description</h3>

I would like to raise this ticket to investigate what we would need in order to support extensions (share-extensions, watch-extensions, tvOS-extensions, messenger-extensions, ...) in Titanium using Hyperloop. 

Obviously, we need a CLI for managing the linking of different targets to the main Titanium application as well as a directory structure to place extensions and their assets.

A new CSPEC might be the correct way to collect the different thoughts on this.
