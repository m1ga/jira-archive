<h3>Description</h3>

With Titanium SDK 5.4.0 and 6.0.0 being different with respect to modules (especially Android), we need a better way to maintain the Hyperloop modules.

Creating a branch 1_2_X in Hyperloop Repo. This is for TiSDK 5.4.0+

Master branch in Hyperloop Repo will effectively be 2_0_X until it's needed to be branched. This is for TiSDK 6.0.0+

   Currently there is a 5_4_X branch in hyperloop. Deleting this branch.
