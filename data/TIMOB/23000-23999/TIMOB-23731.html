<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Updated to nightly build and seems to be solved, but is not. Now, output shows only with 'info' level. Even If you change to 'trace' level, output still shows only info level..</h4>

   Thanks..</li>

   The reason you do not see any <code>TRACE</code> output is because the module build script doesn't output any <code>TRACE</code> output.
   
   There are only a few instances where you'll see <code>DEBUG</code> messages and it's when you build and run the module, which I don't believe is the default behavior from Studio.
   
   There is only 1 <code>WARN</code> message and your module doesn't trigger it to be displayed.
   
   In other words, there's nothing wrong with the module build and there's nothing wrong with Studio. The module build simply doesn't output as much logging as the application build process.</li>

   I'm sorry but you are totally wrong. Did you already compile any module on Appcelerator Studio? So, i had to download a previous version of Appcelerator Studio and show a "TRACE" output how it should be.

   The module build system was completely replaced in Titanium SDK 5.0.0. The old <code>build.py</code> scripts (or <code>ant</code> for Android modules) have been deprecated.
   
   I'm not sure the exact version of Studio, but newer versions build all modules using the new module build system.
   
   Since the module build system was rewritten, not all output messages were preserved. Instead we tried to make the module build more in line with the application build logging.
   
   So perhaps when you are saying trace output is not being displayed, what you mean is the new module build is not displaying enough information about the build process. For example, the new module build system does NOT proxy any of the output from the <code>javac</code> and <code>ndkbuild</code> commands.</li>
