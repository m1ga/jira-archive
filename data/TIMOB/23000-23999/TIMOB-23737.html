   Hi Sharif,
   Thankyou so much.
   The solution you have given works on Android and iOS.
   But it is NOT working on Windows. Can you please provide a solution for Windows Phone?</li>

   Hello, 
   
   I am not sure on how it's work on Windows phone. Share the sample code that is working on Android and iOS but not on Windows phone. I would suggest asking help in windows community. Also, post a question on StackOverflow. Our rich community can help you out. If it's natively supported on Windows phone that method should work on Appcelerator. If the process does not work on Appcelerator we will consider that as a bug and fix it. But we need reference how this works in Windows phone. I am also looking for solutions in Windows phone. I will get back to you once I have some.
   
   Regards,
