<h3>Description</h3>

We are attempting to display the user's local calendars in an organized list (arranged by which account syncs the data). Just like in the image below, we can retrieve the individual calendars, but we cannot retrieve the individually-descriptive sources where the Calendars are coming from.
For example, we'd like to show "iCloud", "Facebook", "Google", "Other", and others as the sources of data where calendars are coming from.
None of that data is available through the Titanium API, it seems, but it is certainly available through the native SDK on both Android and iOS

   Attempt to expose all properties on Android. But since the fetching of details is very ugly on the native side (using column-indexes), I'm not 100 % sure if the columns really exits. Therefore, we need a detailed FT on Android as well.</li>

   @Hans, so if a column doesn't exist, it will simply just return back blank? If so, then that makes sense and would be something I would check for when using the property or method you expose.
   
   Also, what is an "FT"?</li>
<li>Angel Petkov 2016-08-29

   [~Yrkh8trnoy] FT stands for feature test, which is part of the process taken when reviewing PR's. Currently using the column indexes doesn't seem to work, so we need to approach this in a different manner to grab the properties, before we can add this feature to android. </li>

   Cool, thanks for the update Angel. Also, just a thought, this may need to be checked for Windows as well. Maybe not, but just putting that out there.</li>

   Hey guys, any progress on this as of late?</li>
<li>Hans Knöchel 2016-11-24

   Hey [~Yrkh8trnoy], haven't investigated further so far. We'll update this ticket when we can schedule it, thx!</li>

   Thanks for the update, Hans!</li>

   Hi folks. Checking in on this. Can you provide an update? When will this be appropriately triaged? It seems that it has just been forgotten...
   
   Thanks!</li>

   Hey [~Yrkh8trnoy], it isn't. We focussed on fixing issues in 6.1.0, as well as other long-term cross-platform open issues. This ticket is an improvement ticket, your'e the only (external) watcher and it's Android only. We will look into it, but please allow us to fix other (critical) issues first. Thx!</li>
