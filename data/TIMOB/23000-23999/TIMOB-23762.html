<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Description</h4>

When building an app to a Windows 10 Mobile device a second time the application fails to install with the below error.

The latest Universal tools are needed for this error to occur

<code><pre>
ERROR] :  Failed to install app (code 2148734208): Windows App Deployment Tool

This was already fixed in the cloned ticket but it appears the error code has now been changed to 2148734208

<h4>Steps to reproduce</h4>

1. Build to a Windows 10 Mobile phone using <code>appc run -p windows -T wp-device </code>
2. Rebuild the app using <code>appc run -p windows -T wp-device</code>

<h4>Actual result</h4>

The app fails to install, a developer will currently have to uninstall their app each build

<h4>Expected result</h4>

The app should be reinstalled, a developer should not have to remove the same application each time they build

   Verified using:
   
   Windows 10 Pro 
   Appc core: 6.0.0-26 
   Appc NPM: 4.2.8-5 
   Ti SDK: 6.0.0.v20160822001523
   Lumia 930: 10.0 
   
   Install of an application on second build is now successful.
   
   [~kota] just a heads up that I have filed TIMOB-23800 as another error code has changed in the latest tools
   
   Closing ticket</li>
