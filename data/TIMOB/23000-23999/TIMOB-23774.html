<h3>Description</h3>

- Team id is now required in the tiapp.xml when building an app with a watch extension and Xcode 8.
- Added build configuration settings for swift files in watch apps
Namely set the "SWIFT_VERSION" to "2.2", if it's not already set... all new Watch extension projects will have this set to "3.0"
- Removed old watchos2 template in favor of existing watchos2-objc template.
- Set default min iOS SDK version to 8.0 if not explicitly set in the tiapp.xml and compiling using Xcode 8.
- Removed old maintainers from package.jsons.

   [~cng] In regards to this change: 
   - Team id is now required in the tiapp.xml when building an app with a watch extension and Xcode 8.
   
   Are there any plans to have team id generated in the tiapp.xml automatically? For instance when someone creates a Watch Extension in their project. When running through the basic steps to creating an Watch App project through the CLI, I am met with this error: 
   <code><pre>
   [ERROR] Xcode 8.0 requires Watch Extensions have a team specified, but a &lt;team-id&gt; is not set.
   
   Log into the Apple Developer website and create a team, then add/refresh your account in Xcode's preferences window in order for Titanium to see your teams.
   
   &lt;ti:app xmlns:ti="<a href="http://ti.appcelerator.org" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://ti.appcelerator.org</a>"&gt;
       &lt;ios&gt;
           &lt;team-id&gt;TEAM ID&lt;/team-id&gt;
       &lt;/ios&gt;
   &lt;/ti:app&gt;
   </pre></code>

   [~htbryant] The team id is generated by Apple from your account on developer.apple.com. Not sure that generating a team id would work. Maybe for simulator builds. Pretty easy to test. Just set the <code>&lt;team-id&gt;</code> to some string.</li>
<li>Chris Barber 2016-08-18

   Team ids are returned by <code>ti info</code>, so Studio could provide a pretty dropdown in the tiapp.xml editor.
   
   In a future Titanium SDK release, we will most likely introduce a <code>\-\-team\-id</code> option instead of a <code>\-\-pp\-uuid</code> to start handling provisioning profiles the new Xcode 8 way.
   
   On the plus side, at least when you get the error, it does attempt to display a list of team ids. Unfortunately, the list of team ids comes from an a sqlite xcode cache database combined with the team ids parsed from all provisioning profiles. In other words, if you have a team, but you've never logged into Apple from Xcode's preferences and you don't have any valid, non-expired provisioning profiles installed, then we will report no teams found.</li>
