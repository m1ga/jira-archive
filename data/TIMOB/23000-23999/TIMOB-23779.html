<h3>Description</h3>

When starting an app on iPad with orientation coded for landscape, the device rotates as expected but the launch screen is using the portrait version.  On iPhone, the orientation and selected launch screen behaves as expected.

   Thanks for the ticket. Did this work prior to 5.4.0? And can you upload a minified example project we can test? Thanks!</li>

   I apologize it tool me so long to get back to you.  All I have done to recreate this is the following:
   
   1)  Create a new mobile app project (SDK 5.4.0)
   2)  Modify tiapp.xml changing enable-launch-screen-storyboard to false
   3)  Modify tiapp.xml removing UISupportedInterfaceOrientations~ipad options for Portrait
   4)  Run to iPad Retina (v9.3)
   
   Simulator changes to landscape orientation and show default Appcelerator splash image in Portrait (sideways).
   
   I honestly can't say if this worked prior to 5.4.0 as this is the first project I've worked on in some time where I've needed to lock the orientation.  I've tried building back to 5.2.0, get same outcome, but obviously same CLI.  I did do a project, I believe back in the 3.X days, and did not have this issue.  Also, in case I was clear, the exact same procedure, or even a project exhibiting this issue, if run to simulator iPhone 6S Plus (v9.3) works as expected.</li>
