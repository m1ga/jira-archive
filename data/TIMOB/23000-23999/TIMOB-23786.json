					"body": "h2. Important!\r\n\r\nThe new logging system uses a TCP port. The port number is ALWAYS determined at build time, never at run time. This means that if you build two different Titanium apps, they cannot use the same port at the same time. There are a couple ways the tooling works to overcome this.\r\n\r\nFor both simulator and device builds, the iOS build will auto-select a port between 10000 and 60000 based on the app id. For example, the app id {{com.appcelerator.testapp3269}} will generate the port {{10416}}. The primary reason we do this is attempt to avoid the same port being used by different apps. The other reason we do this so we don't have a different port each build and crippling differential builds. A nice side-effect is the new logging system allows multiple simultaneous clients as well as reconnects and having a consistent port is convenient.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that because we are auto-selecting a port number based on the app id, the probability of a collision is extremely high. {{com.appcelerator.testapp17}} and {{com.appcelerator.testapp8249}} both resolve to port {{19024}}. This is where {{<log-server-port>}} comes in handy. You may specify a {{<log-server-port>XXXXX</log-server-port>}} in the {{<ios>}} section of the {{tiapp.xml}} and it will always be used first. Also note that the port number must be an integer between 1 and 65535 and probably should be greater than {{1024}} to avoid binding to a privileged port. The port number should be unique per project. You only need to use this if the auto-selected port number is causing collisions with other apps. This is really only a problem when working with multiple projects at the same time.\r\n\r\nIf there is a collision where two different apps are being built AND running at the same time with the same port, the first app to launch will get the port. The second app will try to bind to it, but it will fail. It is very important to note that whichever app launches 2nd will fail to bind to the port, however the 2nd app will still continue to run normally, just without logs. For simulator builds, you can open the simulator's {{system.log}}, or for device builds, use the macOS Sierra Console application at any time to view the log messages.\r\n\r\nThe biggest issue to be aware of is the 2nd app's iOS build will end up connecting to the 1st app's log server. There is currently no way for the iOS build to know which log server for which app it has connected to. In the future we may introduce a more proper protocol to handle this.\r\n\r\nFor simulator builds only, the port is shared with the local machine. For example, you could use port {{27017}} for device builds, but you can't for simulator builds if you have MongoDB installed. So, if there is no {{<log-server-port>}}, or there is, but it's not available, or the app id-based port is not available, then the iOS build will fallback to a random port number that will certainly change every build.\r\n\r\nIt's also worth noting that for simulator builds only, the iOS build will start up a Node.js server on the selected port to make sure it's available. If it isn't, it will randomly test ports until it finds an available port. To be clear, device builds do not have this limitation.\r\n\r\nThe client in the iOS build that connects to the app will always connect after the app has started. This means it's possible for several messages to have already been logged. Because of this, Titanium will queue the last 100 log messages only while there are no client connections. As soon as the iOS build connects to the log server, the queue is flushed and released. This shouldn't be a huge deal since the client tries to connect every 250ms.\r\n\r\nFinally, logging is only enabled for simulator and device builds. It is NOT enabled for app store or adhoc builds. You can enable it by hacking the build system or via a CLI plugin.\r\n\r\n[~bimmel] please use the rambling above to document the behavior, limitations, and settings. Thanks!",

It looks to me that there is only attention to OS'es new gimmicks, instead of realizing that a lot of developers have an update issue of existing apps for customers.\r\nIt's a developer's nightmare to be confronted with having released apps that cannot be continued/developed/supported by newer versions of the development chain.\r\nFor example see the screenshot.\r\nThis is a module that is critical for several apps. The company that I bought the module from is not responding to any questions at all. Likely no 6.x update will be made available. I need to update this large app, as it looks now I must develop/buy a completely new Bluetooth module. It is from Appcelerator's side too easy to simply \"not support\" it. Source code is not available so updating the module is not possible by me. Didn't you think of the number of module supplier's that are confronted by having to update their modules?\r\n\r\n\"Just Android that was affected\"... we are talking about a multi platform development tool! You cannot simply cut off 50% of all apps!\r\n\r\nWho is going to pay for all extra cost? I cannot do that because my company is too small.\r\n\r\nWhat is needed is a 5.x to 6.x migration guide; what can you encounter and how can you solve it?\r\nThe solution for a lot of developers in my opinion is to make 6.x support older modules!!!\r\nOtherwise it stops for us.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to hearing from you again.\r\nBest regards,\r\nRaymond",

It's impossible to make SDK 6.0 support older modules because of the requirements of Chrome updates.\r\n\r\nIf these options still do not meet your needs, please file a support ticket, and we'll see how else we can assist.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nIngo",

					"body": "Hi Ingo,\r\n\r\nFirst of all the best wishes for 2017!!\r\n\r\nI understand what you are saying.\r\nAnd I understand that you are confronted with changes.\r\n\r\nMy main issue is that we - as developers - need to maintain apps for customers.\r\nI choose for appcelerator already about 5 years ago, because of it's single code-base multi platform system.\r\nDuring the time a lot of appcelerator major updates we have been confronted with changes that need a lot of extra work.\r\nWork without adding functionality or improvements, only to keep the development toolchain up to date.\r\n\r\nThe following happened:\r\nNeeded to do a small quick update for a customer.\r\n\r\nNo logging! Google help -> the Ti.API.info IOS10 logging issue. This one is not mentioned nor is there a compatible workaround documented.\r\n\"Use macOS Sierra for logging output\"... what? how? A major function is not working anymore, so a little more help than that is needed...\r\n\r\nSwitch to SDK6, but some Android modules are not supported anymore.\r\nAlso the given Ti.include(\"functions.js\") workaround does not work anymore in my Alloy project (yes, it did). From alloy.js it does not include the \"functions.js\" file in the lib folder. Already deprecated since 3.3.0? SDK compiler 5.x still did not give a message about this. And I can surely understand that \"require\" is much better but there is no time for changing all that now. Lot of functions, and no right-click -> find references function in Appcelerator Studio...\r\n\r\nI hope you can understand my frustrations.\r\n\r\nLike I said, what is needed is a 5.x to 6.x migration guide; what can you encounter and how can you solve it? \r\nInstead of needing to call google for help when something is not working.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nRaymond",

Mixing CommonJS and Ti.Include isn't a good solution can lead to many more issues. It should be straight-forward as well to port your Includes to commonJS modules, which will give better isolation, and reduce the risk of performance issues and memory leaks.\r\n\r\nPing me on Ti-Slack if you have any issues.\r\n\r\nJason\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
