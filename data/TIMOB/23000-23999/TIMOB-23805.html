<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Problem:</h4>
When user uses the external keyboard's 'tab' button to go the next input field while inputting text, the app is behaving weirdly(screen will be off-centered.) instead of going to the next text field.

<h4>Steps to reproduce:</h4>
1. Run KeyTest app in iPad simulator.
2. Click on a TextField in the first screen with value "View1 - Field00".
3. Click "Tab" in the Mac Keyboard or soft Keyboard.

Then the screen will be off-centered. Also, if we keep pressing it, it will be moving to next TextField in next page rather in same page.

If we remove the tag  "<ScrollView height="Ti.UI.FILL" id="scrollView"> ....</ScrollView>" from top, it will stop distorting the screen on Tab click but even though TAB click behavior is not correct. It keeps moving to next screen instead of going to TextField in same screen.

We tried to build the app on both 5.2.2.GA(customer Environment) and 5.4.0.GA(support Environment), and we see the same behavior. 


<h4>Expected Result: </h4>
Clicking on Tab should not distort the screen and Tab click should take the focus on next TextField in same Scrollable Page rather going to next page in Scrollable view.

   This may not be a bug. I don't think we support keyboard 'tab' key pressed because our sdk is primarily for mobile development that primarily uses the on-screen keyboard on each device. This is more a feature request or improvement. 
   Also, a better alternative is to use the '<' '>' that's on the toolbar above the keyboard on an iOS device. is that working as expected?

   Ok, so for the offset, it's definitely the <code>ScrollView</code> that's caussing the issue. You cannot place a <code>ScrollableView</code> inside a <code>ScrollView</code> and handle scroll properly, since both would intercept each other. After that, I am able to focus the second field from the first field. But after that, the next row won't be focussed. This - on the other hand - is a native behavior which needs manual adjustment.
   
   I will try to update the example-code to set the field-order properly.</li>
