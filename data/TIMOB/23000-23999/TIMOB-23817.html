<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Description</h4>

As per Chris on flowdock, 5.x has ben EOL'd, we should not tell a user to install it, like below when running SDK 6.0.0 or 6.1.0 with Node 0.12.7

<code><pre>
ERROR] Titanium SDK 6.0.0.v20160823163945 is incompatible with Node.js v0.12.7

You will need to install Node.js v5 in order to use this version of the Titanium SDK.
</pre></code>
<code><pre>
cbarber
@team, io.js (all versions) and Node.js 5.x has been end of life'd today... only Node.js 4.x and 6.x is supported and will receive fixes/backports
</pre></code>

<h4>Steps to reproduce</h4>

<h4>Install Node 0.12.7 and either a 6_0_X or master branch SDK</h4>
<h4>Try to run a titanium command such as <code>appc ti info</code></h4>

<h4>Actual result</h4>

The command will error as you are using a version lower than supported, you are told to install v5

<h4>Expected result</h4>

The command will error as you are using a version lower than supported, you should be told to install a supported version of Node

   Verified that the error message has been updated from telling the user they need to install Node.js v5 to telling the user that they need to install Node.js v6 in order to use this version of the Titanium SDK.</li>
