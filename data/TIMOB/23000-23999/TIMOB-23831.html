<h3>Description</h3>

Hi,

I would like my application name to change on changing the locale.

I followed your documentation at <a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#</a>!/guide/Internationalization and added app.xml in app/i18n/ folder for both English and Spanish. But the application name would not change on changing the locale of the Windows 10 640 Lumia .

   So after the discussion with Appcelerator Support team, I have used "app_name" for the localization for app supporting English and Spanish , as noted in the link here: <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile_windows/pull/572" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile_windows/pull/572</a>
   
   The issue arises when I change the device language from Spanish to anything other than English which is not supported by the application (eg. Deutsch). In this case the application name is still displayed in Spanish, if the locale was changed from Spanish to Deutsch. Is there a way default application name can be set or even default language for application.</li>

   I was thinking <code>en</code> locale is treated as default locale. This means when you set <code>app_name</code> to "en" locale, it is treated as default app name. But I'm not very sure. I will test it and create new ticket for it when that is the case.</li>

   After some investigation, I found that Windows always constructs application name from initial installation locale.
   
   It means
   
   * If you use Spanish when you install the app, application name is constructed from Spanish resource.
   * If you use Deutsch when you install the app, Windows uses application name from Deutsch resource.
   * If no resources are found, default name (project name that you uses for Titanium project) is used.
   * *Windows doesn't change initial application name* even when you change the locale _after_ the installation.
   
   So even when you change the locale _after_ you install the app, Windows doesn't changes the application name. As far as I can find, it is because of Windows spec, not because of Titanium behavior. I will keep searching for a workaround but currently I have no idea how to workaround this.

   Closing this as "Not Our Bug" for now because we see that  Windows always constructs application name from initial installation locale and there's no workaround as far as we know. Feel free to reopen this if you think that's not the case.</li>
