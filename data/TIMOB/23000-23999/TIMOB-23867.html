<h3>Description</h3>

With SDK *5.4.0.v20160331065118*  I can't build to device, I re-checked my certificates and my iphone connection,
Soon I put back the *5.2.1.GA* the build was succeed!

Usually I *connect and disconnect the cable* and resolve the situation, but in this case did not happen.

   Hello, 
   
   <code><pre>[ERROR] :  Failed to start 'com.apple.syslog_relay' service (0xe800007f)</pre></code> Usually can be resolved by disconnecting and reconnecting the device. 
   
   I can't reproduce the issue in 5.4.0. I have tested a sample app in the SDK and built it. App runs fine. I would suggest you to try creating a new project and test it. Also, You should use a GA version of SDK. Latest one 5.2.1.GA. 
   
   Regards,
   Sharif

   This syslog_relay bug is there for ages and is really annoying. As Nuno already said, most of the time you can work around it by reconnecting the device or restarting device or the mac. Today i fiddled again for about an hour with this bug. I'm using SDK 5.3.1. I want to comment my resolution for further investigation of this bug.
   
   I often see devices not connected via cable listed under the device list. I assume they are somehow connected via iTunes-WLAN-sync although it's disabled for all my devices. So today I had this syslog_relay bug for one physically connected iOS device. Out of desperation I disconnected the cable of the device and noticed that Studio still lists it and tries to install to that device with the syslog_relay error message. Only after i had disabled WLAN on the device, it disappeared from the list and Studio displayed the device not found error message. After that I connected it again with the lightning cable and could deploy to the device immediately.
   
   My assumption is that under certain circumstances I failed to reproduce, the device-list fetches WLAN connected devices that overrule physically connected devices making the deploy process fail with the syslog_relay message.</li>

   This is still happening on 5.4.0.GA</li>

   Reopening. This seems to occur when the device is visible via wifi as well as plugged in. Here is my log with 5.4.0:
   <code><pre>
   [ERROR] An error occurred during build after 40s 455ms
   [ERROR] Failed to start "com.apple.syslog_relay" service (0xe800007f)
   [ERROR] Try reconnecting your device and try again.
   </pre></code>
   
   Turning off wifi on the iPhone, then disconnecting and reconnecting it allowed me to build. Turning wifi back on with the phone not connected, verifying that it appears in the list of devices, then connecting, allowed me to reproduce again.
   
   will continue to investigate and follow-up. There is a chance that the fix for TIMOB-23790 might solve this problem. We will test that tomorrow. </li>

   [~l0wb1rd] I think you got it exactly.
   
   One of the fixes Chris made for TIMOB-23790 was to not select wifi devices if any are present. Since you can't build to them, they are ignored. This would explain the intermittency as well, since if the Mac sees the phone as connected first, all is well. This can vary based on the phone being asleep, unlocked, or if the Mac is "trusted". 
   
   I just did a single quick test of SDK 5.5.0.v20160822000355 and it looks like it addresses the problem. When I set the project back to 5.4.0.GA - Same error again. Will continue to hammer on this tomorrow and will report back.</li>
