<h3>Description</h3>

Android emulators that are created with Android Studio are not being recognized correctly. Because the Android Studio provides pretty fast emulators since a while, we might want to fix this issue.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a new emulator through Android Studio (e.g. Nexus 5, API level 23)
2. Check your environment with <code>appc ti info</code>
3. Note the android warning (also typo in "Uknown"):
<code><pre>
  The Android emulator "Nexus_5_API_23" has a problem:
     Uknown error
</pre></code>
4. Run a new android-project with <code>appc run -p android</code>

Expected behavior: The CLI finds the Android emulator, starts the app
Actual behavior: An error log is thrown:
<code><pre>
[ERROR] Unable to find any emulators

Please create an Android emulator, then try again.
</pre></code>

I'm not sure if we ever supported the simulators from Android Studio, but I'm pretty sure we did in the past. And since Genymotion is not licensed for free non-private projects anymore, supporting the "official one" should be a good reason to check this issue. Thanks!

   I think you have to create emulators in the android console and not android studio for it to work well with appc. [~msamah][~gmathews] can you verify this? If so, we probably should update our guide and say that you have to create emulators using android.</li>

   Both manage the AVD (Android Virtual Devices) from the same place. It should work.
   I myself use only Android emulators. I do not use Genymotion. 
   
   Thus, it's probably some configuration issues or environment.</li>

   I cannot reproduce this on Windows, emulators created by both AVD and Android Studio are found by the CLI and launch correctly. I will try on OSX.</li>
