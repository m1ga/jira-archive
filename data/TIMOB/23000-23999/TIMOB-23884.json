In my other use-case, I made two apps where I switched to that one and returned, which triggered the resumed event and closed the dialog. \r\n\r\n*EDIT*: Just added another test-case to my environment: I can now confirm that the above delegate *does* fire for iOS < 10 but not on iOS 10.

Where can I get the pre-release?\r\n\r\nIs that rule about the 'resumed' event not supposed to fire when you work with the SafariDialog new?  In iOS 9 it was fired.  If that is not the case how am I supposed to get something done in SafariDailog and then get back to my app?  The web page has to be able to interact with the app that was running.\r\n\r\nThe whole point of using the SafariDialog is to gather additional information and then get back to the app.  What is the proper way to do that.  I want to get back to the same app, not another app.  I don't have 2 apps.\r\n\r\nEDIT: I do have an Apple bug open and I have added the information you gave me to it.  Thank you.  The Apple bug id is 28211987.",

You can get the current build from [here|builds.appcelerator.com/#5_5_X], we well as from the Beta- and RC-versions we released over the last weeks. As said above, it seems like either Apple changed that behavior on purpose or they broke the functionality. It's nothing we intercept with our SDK. Let me check how the whole thing behaves natively, I get your point and trying to help as much as possible :-)\r\n\r\n*EDIT*: Thanks for the bugreport, I'm really interested on what they will answer. Thanks for that! Unfortunately, they have several more issues that were still present in the 7.0 GM last week, so there will likely be a 7.0.1 very soon, hopefully with that one as well - or they give a good reason why it's not firing.",

They jump out to FB for login and then get back to the app and with my investigation it looks like they are using the url scheme to do so.\r\n\r\nI really appreciate all your help!\r\n\r\nI've had the Apple bug open since Thursday and no one has responded to it yet. Do you have any tricks to get action on that?  Maybe more than one person reporting it.",

Don't see a problem there. But that would go into 6.0.0, since 5.5.0 will already be released tomorrow.",
