<h3>Description</h3>

We had a lot of struggle around Ti.Facebook and iOS 10 / Xcode 8 the last days. Now that everything works (by creating an entitlements file), I thought about how we can make the process easier again. 

And I came up with an approach where we hook into the (early) build-process and check for the entitlements file. If it is not there, we generate it from here as we have the required information (app-name, app-identifier). The whole thing could be done with a plugin that is bundled with the module. Eventually we would version the plugin to 1.0.0 to be able to push plugin-updates if there are any in the future.

   Not necessary anymore, as we cleverly inject the entitlements using module-hooks since 5.5.1.</li>

   Closing old "Won't fix" tickets. If you disagree, please reopen.</li>
