   Got an answer from Apple, seems like a valid issue that has already been reported:

   Hello Hans,
   
   Engineering has determined that your bug report (28368930) is a duplicate of another issue (12948705) and will be closed. 
   
   The open or closed status of the original bug report your issue was duplicated to appears in the yellow "Duplicate of XXXXXXXX" section of the bug reporter user interface. This section appears near the top of the right column's bug detail view just under the bug number, title, state, product and rank.

   Will update this ticket as soon as Apple provides a fix.</li>
