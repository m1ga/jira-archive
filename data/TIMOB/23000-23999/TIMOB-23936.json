		"description": "h5.Issue Description\r\nTi SDK 5.5.0 and iOS 10 introduce new behaviors and expose a bug in Titanium using Ti.Media.showCamera() with an overlay\r\n\r\nUsing SDK 5.2.2, and setting allowEditing=false. Yet, users could still pinch to zoom and tap within the photo to set the exposure point. With iOS 10, app built with 5.2.2 and allowEditing set to false,  pinch & exposure no longer work.\r\n\r\nMigrating to 5.5.x / Xcode 8 and testing the code with that environment with allowEditing=false, pinch & exposure don't work. (NSCameraUsageDescription key is added in tiapp.xml.)\r\n\r\nSetting allowEditing=true, users can again pinch to zoom and set exposure, however, they can no longer tap on the buttons in the overlay. It's as if the camera preview is at a higher zIndex .. the overlay is visible however touch events go to the camera not the overlay.\r\n\r\nAs a result, users are stuck -- they can't tap on the overlay's Done button to close the camera and use the rest of the app. They have to force-quit the app. \r\n\r\nh6. Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n# Donwload Test app at https://www.dropbox.com/s/ufsealzqfqdpytj/app.zip?dl=0\r\n\r\n# Create a default Alloy project. \r\n# Make sure to add the NSCameraUsageDescription to the tiapp.xml.  \r\n# Replace the app folder with the one linked above. \r\n# Build to an iOS 10 device. \r\n# Tap open camera. \r\n# You can pinch to zoom and tap to set exposure, but the shutter button and Done buttons don't respond to taps. \r\n# Edit the app/controllers/index.js to set allowEditing=false, rebuild. \r\n# This time, you cannot pinch to zoom but you can tap the shutter or done buttons. \r\n\r\n* Adjusting the zIndex on the overlay view has no effect.\r\n",

Maybe the interference changed for iOS 10, so we could wrap it accordingly. Testing ...\r\n\r\n*EDIT*: Yeah, removing that snippet solves the issue. I'm pretty sure it was an old hack (implemented: 2010, SDK 1.8.0) to fix some native misbehavior. To ensure, I need this tested against an iOS 9 and iOS 8 device. [~eharris] / [~htbryant] can I send one of you guys a packaged SDK to test?\r\n\r\n*Summary*: I guess Apple has made the pinch-zoom and exposure as part of {{allowEditing}} on iOS 10. So the customer could enable it as proposed and we fix the line above to either be removed completely or only be called on iOS < 10. That's what I need feedback from the QE regarding the current behavior of iOS < 10 will the above test-case compared to iOS 10. After that, I can setup a proper PR. Thanks!",

It also only occurs with the 6.0.X build. The usual case is that when {{height}} and {{width}} are not specified, the default value will be {{Ti.UI.SIZE}}, which seems to be the case for 5.5.1.GA. \r\n\r\nAdditionally when I replaced the numerical values of the {{height}} and {{width}} properties to it's default equivalent: {{Ti.UI.FILL}} / {{Ti.UI.SIZE}} , the overlay was not visible when built with 6.0.X \r\n\r\n",

However if the same overlay view from the controller was changed to be of lesser height like 100 then camera view shown beyond worked fine for zoom on iOS 10 as well. Also if a simple view was created in the index.js and passed to the overlay instead of the view from controller, the zoom works on iOS 10.\r\n\r\nAs far as Tap to Exposure property is concerned it behaves the same in Titanium app as it behaves in a native iOS app. The Tap to exposure works on iOS 10 only when showControls = True in both Titanium and native swift app.\r\n ",

While I'd prefer to not see the camera controls box, frankly if it has to be there in order to get pinch to zoom and exposure control working, I can live with it. Again, Apple having a bug that makes it impossible to hide that box is not justification for closing this ticket as FIXED.\r\n\r\nThe only thing fixed here is that UI elements in my overlay are now tappable.

The summary (as stated above) is that Apple changed the behavior in iOS (or caused an iOS bug - like the transform one). We attached a native project during the discussion last months, did multiple native device tests and it's all behaving the same. The fix we applied fixed the tap-gestures as stated by you, that's why this ticket has been marked as {{Fixed}}. If there would be a fix on the native side, we would apply it, but so far there isn't. Please let me know if I should record another video demonstrating the native behavior, but no code-adjustment could change that.",

He deserves a raise, by the way.\r\n\r\nIn our testing, we have found that due to a change in iOS 10, you cannot have multiple views overlaid atop the camera window. For example, using my sample app posted on 13/Dec/16, by removing both the {{wrapper}} and {{flashOverlay}} views from the overlay the pinch to zoom and exposure controls work on an iOS 10 device. An iOS 9.3.5 device works fine with those Views present or removed.\r\n\r\nSetting the additional views to {{opacity: 0}} or {{backgroundColor: 'transparent'}} does not resolve the issue. It appears to be something related to events on child views not bubbling to the parents properly. \r\n\r\nThis means that I will have to rework our UI layout. But, at least the problem is now solvable. Thanks Hans!!",
