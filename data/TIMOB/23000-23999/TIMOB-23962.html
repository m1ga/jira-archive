<h3>Description</h3>

When capturing video using showCamera() both the generated video and the preview video are extremely blurred (low quality).

I have tried to use all videoQuality options available on docs (Ti.Media.QUALITY_HIGH, Ti.Media.QUALITY_MEDIUM, Ti.Media.QUALITY_LOW, Ti.Media.QUALITY_640x480, Ti.Media.QUALITY_IFRAME_960x540, Ti.Media.QUALITY_IFRAME_1280x720)

When compared to photo quality both on preview as in the captured frames, the video always seem very blurry and low quality independently of the videoQuality setting.

This is far more perceivable on iPhone 6S Plus when compared to iPhone 5S and iPhone 6 but the video on those devices have lower quality when compared between video captured from the ti app against video captured directly from the camera app.

I have also tried to manually focus (tap focus) to different areas on the screen and it didn't solve the problem.

All attached previews where taken with videoQuality: Ti.Media.QUALITY_HIGH but the problem persists on all videoQuality options as mentioned above.

   Can you check if the 6.0.0 build changes something? <code>Ti.Media.QUALITY_IFRAME_960x540, Ti.Media.QUALITY_IFRAME_1280x720</code> are only available in Titanium SDK 6.0.0 and later, and I also remember that I recently fixed something regarding the video-quality as well. Thx!
   
   *EDIT*: See [this commit](<a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/blame/6_0_X/iphone/Classes/MediaModule.m#L1586)." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/blame/6_0_X/iphone/Classes/MediaModule.m#L1586).</a></li>

   Hi @Hans,
   
   I have tested again using iPhone 6S Plus on 6.0.0.v20160929101355 and it seems fixed on 6.0.X branch!
   
   Both Ti.Media.QUALITY_HIGH as Ti.Media.QUALITY_IFRAME_XXXXXXXX options have perfect previews and are recording HQ video properly!
   
   Thanks.</li>

   Happy to hear, thank you [~ygbr]! For the records, the duplicate ticket is TIMOB-23847.</li>
<li>Hans Knöchel 2016-10-05

   One side-note for all people seeing this ticket. It's actual a native behavior, see the attached project "test_camera.zip" that produces the same output.</li>
<li>Ygor Lemos 2016-10-05

   Hi @Hans,
   
   I think that in the case you have attached the capture quality is blurry because you have explicitly set the video quality to Low in [picker setVideoQuality:UIImagePickerControllerQualityTypeLow];
   
   Higher qualities seem ok to me. The default is UIImagePickerControllerQualityTypeMedium according to Apple docs.</li>
<li>Hans Knöchel 2016-10-05

   Hey gotcha. The comment was more meant for the issues one of our Slack users noticed on iOS 10. But since the camera-quality-issue is fixed now anyway, we're fine.</li>

   Closing ticket as duplicate, please refer to TIMOB-23847.</li>
