<h3>Description</h3>

Apparently the iOS build fails when tryign to build with an Xcode managed provisioning profile. We need to investigate this.

<code><pre>
[ERROR] Error details: Provisioning profile "iOS Team Provisioning Profile: *" is Xcode managed, but signing settings require a manually managed profile.
</pre></code>

   Chris, I have confirmed that creating a "manual" provisioning profile solved my problems. I am able to build to device. Once you find a solution for the xcode managed profile, please let me know and I will be happy to test.
   
   Thanks.</li>

   [~hansknoechel] Perhaps it's based on the name? Easy to test, manually create a provisioning profile with the name similar to that of a managed provisioning profile.
   
   Or, perhaps managed provisioning profiles are registered in the Xcode cache db?</li>

   They are stored in the same location (<code>~/Library/MobileDevice/Provisioning Profiles</code>). The names are:
   <code><string>iOS Team Provisioning Profile: *</string></code>
   vs
   <code><string>WILDCARD</string></code>
   so maybe the star causes problems? Probably too easy to be responsible for the issues.</li>

   I checked the local Xcode database and there's nothing in there that flags a specific provisioning profile as managed. After some more research, Xcode generates both an App ID and a provisioning profile, however only the App ID shows up in the Apple developer website.
   
   I created a bunch of provisioning profiles using the generated App ID and here's what I found:
   
   
   ||Name||Result||
   |CBTest|Built app just fine|
   |iOS Team Provisioning Profile: *|Failed to create because name was already used even though it wasn't in list|
   |iOS Team Provisioning Profile: CBTest|Failed to build app|
   |iOS Team Provisioning Profile CBTest|Failed to build app|
   |kiOS Team Provisioning Profile: CBTest|Failed to build app|
   |iOS Team Provisioning CB|Built app just fine|
   |ios team provisioning profile: cbtest|Built app just fine|
   
   So, it is just a naming thing. If the provisioning profile literally contains "iOS Team Provisioning Profile", then we can't use it. Note that it IS case sensitive.
   
   I will update <code>ioslib</code> to return a <code>managed</code> property, then the Titanium iOS build and info will act accordingly.</li>

   I don't know if we want to take this in 6.0.0, but here's the PR: <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/8498." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/8498.</a>
   
   To test:
   
   1. Make sure you have at least one managed provisioning profile installed where the provisioning profile must contain "iOS Team Provisioning Profile".
   2. Run <code>ti info -t ios</code> and verify that it prints that it is unsupported. 
   3. Run <code>ti build -p ios -T device -P foo</code> and make sure that managed pp-uuids are not listed in prompt.
   4. Run <code>ti build -p ios -T device -P <managed-pp-uuid></code> and make sure the build errors with <code>[ERROR] Specified provisioning profile UUID "<managed-pp-uuid>" is managed and not supported</code>.</li>

   PR's approved and merged! When using <code>ti info -t ios</code>, the following output is given:
   <code><pre>
     iOS Team Provisioning Profile: *
       UUID                      = 9f0c6453-5bd0-4068-9a6e-de6dc112a2cb
       App Prefix                = 6K4KHD4NQF
       App Id                    = *
       Date Created              = 9/16/2016 4:19 PM
       Date Expired              = 9/16/2017 4:19 PM
       Managed                   = Yes and is NOT compatible with Titanium
   </pre></code>
   When running on the device using <code>appc run -p ios -T device</code>, the managed profile is not listed:
   <code><pre>

   Looks great!</li>

   Hi All, 
   
   what is the fix for this issue? Must I wait for the next update? or is there a published fix now.?
   
   I may have missed it above, My first time in this forum or in appcelerator internals. I just want to compile to device cleanly, as it used to.
   
   Thanks
   
   Running on Appcelerator Studio, build: 4.7.1.201609100950
   Build: jenkins-appcelerator-rcp-master-358 (origin/master)
   xcode Version 8.1 (8B62)
   Date: 10 September 2016, 09:51:58</li>

   [~jn] This issue has been resolved and the result is Titanium does not support managed provisioning profiles. It simply displays an error and fails out. This is because the Xcode project we generate doesn't support managed provisioning profiles. We may fix this in the future and remove this limitation. This "fix" will be released with Titanium SDK 6.0.0.</li>

   Cleaning up older fixed issues. If this issue should not have been closed as fixed, please reopen.</li>
