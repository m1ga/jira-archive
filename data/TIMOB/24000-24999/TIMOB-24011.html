<h3>Description</h3>

With the new require behavior, some old "legacy"-style require paths that used to work no longer do. Specifically, if the path has no leading '/', './', or '../' and the first segment of the path is a native module id - but the resources/js file doesn't exist in that module.

This was particularly noticeable with hyperloop on 2.0.0 where we'd generate paths like 'hyperloop/uikit/uilabel', which actually resided in the user's app resources and not in the native hyperloop module itself.

   Combined this fix with the fix for similar issue on Android. Should likely cherry-pick the two commits to 6_0_X if the PR is approved/merged.
