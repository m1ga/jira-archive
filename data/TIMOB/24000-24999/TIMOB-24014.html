<h3>Description</h3>

The MobileDevice.framework can connect to devices over the USB cable and over Wi-Fi. We had to disable Wi-Fi connected devices because we couldn't relay the syslog, but because the syslog is essentially useless now, we can probably bring back Wi-Fi support.

One thing to be careful of is both the USB and Wi-Fi device have the same UDID in the connected devices lookup. We need each device entry to track the USB and Wi-Fi device handles separately.

We need to also make sure we didn't break the log port feature.
