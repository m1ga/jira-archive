   Hello,
   
   Thanks for creating the ticket. The Calendar module provides an API for accessing the native calendar functionality.This module supports retrieving information about existing events and creating new events. Modifying or deleting existing events and creating recurring events are only supported on iOS. Currently, on Android, calendar permissions must be explicitly configured in tiapp.xml in order to access the calendar. <a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#</a>!/api/Titanium.Calendar
   
   Regards,
   Sharif.

   Reopening ticket, since it is the reference ticket of [this community-PR](<a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/8016)." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/8016).</a> [~kopiro] Please add some more infos, demo-code and (if possible) a time-frame when we can plan with the PR. I will move it to the TIMOB-namespace afterwards. Thank you!</li>

   Hello.
   
   So, we made breaking changes to the Calendar Module.
   This PR is not about "Creating and deleting" no more.
   
   *Additions:*
   - Creation and deletions of calendars
   - Support for iOS and Recurrence rules from strings (like Android)
   - Added the rrule property to the Events in Android
   - Added the save method for events in Android
   
   *BREAKING CHANGES:*
   - The months in JS + Android are 0-based, instead in iOS are 1-based. we merged this behaviour and now iOS is zero-based too.
   
   Maybe we should discuss about this.
   
   </li>

   Hey Favio,
   
   interesting fact regarding the month-count. I would like to know how other platforms handle this, can you check that? And if we migrate it, we need to find a way to inform users about the changed behavior, so: docs update, warn-log and mention in the release-notes. As soon as the PR is up, we can schedule a release for it, I will already move it TIMOB. Thanks!</li>

   In PhoneGap, they use 0-based months (<a href="https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/Calendar-PhoneGap-Plugin)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/Calendar-PhoneGap-Plugin)</a>
   ... but, they rely on the timestamps: <a href="https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/Calendar-PhoneGap-Plugin/blob/master/src/ios/Calendar.m#L740" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/Calendar-PhoneGap-Plugin/blob/master/src/ios/Calendar.m#L740</a>
   
   The main problem in Titanium implementation is that the function method declarations are bad for this purpose: 
   
   - *getEventsInDate(Year, Month, Day)*
   - *getEventsInMonth(Year, Month)*
   
   this forces to re-index the month for the current platform.
   
   Maybe, an option could be to declare these two methods as deprecated and continue using only <code>getEventsBetweenDates</code> that is not index-based.</li>
<li>Hans Knöchel 2016-12-16

    Some update here: We didn't forget you :-) But since it's a breaking change, we need to put it in 7.0.0 anyway. That also gives us some more time to test this intensively on both platforms. And maybe we can even achieve parity with Windows until then. Thanks guys!</li>
<li>Hans Knöchel 2017-05-15

    Moving up one release, so we will expose it in 6.2.0 instead of 7.0.0. This is made possible by keeping the month-index where it is for now. For parity reasons, that should be aligned in 7.0.0.
    
    *EDIT*: Due to other changes and bugfixes that had to move before this feature, we schedule it for 7.0.0 and do the indexing right the first place. Sorry for the up and down, hopefully it makes sense to everyone!</li>

    This seems to still be open. Any update on this?</li>
