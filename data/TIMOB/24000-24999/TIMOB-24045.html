   [~lmorris] As far as I can tell after looking at the source code where appropriate and after visiting [google issue tracking](<a href="https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=198567)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=198567)</a> this is to be expected. When code is compiled for API 23 but is deployed on API 19, these methods will be referenced. In the titanium android source code, there are guards that check if current build version is 23 or above otherwise permission methods e.g. checkSelfPermission are not executed.
   
   "this is normal, when you compile your code against 23 but deploy on 19, the IR will add references to methods that were added between 19 and 23." - quoted from [google issue tracking](<a href="https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=198567)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=198567)</a> referenced from [dalvikvm virtual method error](<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36874821/how-to-resolve-this-error-vfy-unable-to-resolve-virtual-method)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36874821/how-to-resolve-this-error-vfy-unable-to-resolve-virtual-method)</a>

   Closing issue as “Cannot Reproduce”. Out of date with our current release (8.1.0.GA as of the date of closure), and out of date with mobile OS versions.
   
   If community members feel that the issue is still valid, please add a comment, and include code that demonstrates/reproduces the issue.</li>
