<h3>Description</h3>

Hi guys.
My app has a listView that has 3 sections. Each section has a button to trigger a request that populates the list with specific data.
It was working fine on SDK 5.X.X, but now it is crashing kind of randomly without showing any logs on Titanium CLI using SDK 6.0.0 beta.
Attached is the log report I exported from Xcode, but logs are not symbolicated (it appears only titanium logs are not symbolicated).

Any help on this issue?
Thanks in advance!

   Reading the crash data, it looks like something to do with http requests (<code>Ti.Network.HTTPClient</code>) or remote images in your list view. 
   
   - Do you have those? 
   - Does this only happen on device?
   - Does this work with other iOS versions?
   - Do you use kroll-thread or main-thread?
   
   And please provide a demo-code to reproduce. Otherwise it will be hard to track down your use-case. Thx!</li>

   Hi Hans.
   No, I don't have remote images in my listView.
   This happens on simulator and on iOS 9.3 as well.
   I'm not sure if I run main-thread. How can I be sure of that?
   
   I will build a demo code for since I don't have permission to share the actual code with you, but it is a simple listView with template, populated via a json response from a endpoint in our API. It was working fine until we bumped to 6.0.0.
   
   Thanks in advance.</li>
<li>Hans Knöchel 2016-10-21

   Yes, you said that before. So what we need is the snippet of code that is causing it. Usually you just isolate the issue and recreate a reproducible test-case fir that. You can check whether you use main-thread in your tiapp.xml by checking if you have the <code>run-on-main-thread</code> property set to <code>true</code>.</li>
<li>Caio Perdona 2016-10-21

   I don't even have this property on my tiapp.xml.
   Will write a test-case and send you asap.</li>

   [~perdona] any updates? :) actually i'm pretty sure there's dSYM file generated. did you check inside the generated build folder?</li>
<li>Caio Perdona 2016-10-26

   @Chee Hi! I'm trying to isolate the issue using the less code possible. Still couldn't reproduce outside the app.
   Where exactly inside the generated build folder?</li>
<li>Chee Kiat Ng 2016-10-27

   [~perdona] <code>&lt;your project folder&gt;/build/iphone/build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/</code></li>
<li>Caio Perdona 2016-10-27

   Yeah, found it. How do I upload it to you guys?</li>
<li>Chee Kiat Ng 2016-10-27

   Oh please don't upload it to us. you have to use it in combination with your crash file to symbolicate it. check out this link:

    Thanks Chee. Will update you guys asap.</li>
<li>Caio Perdona 2016-10-28

    Guys, I got a fully symbolicated log.
    Should I upload it to you?</li>
<li>Chee Kiat Ng 2016-10-29

    [~perdona] sure, I don't think there's any private information in the log. If there is, you can blanko them somehow.
    </li>

    How can I attach files on comments?</li>
<li>Chee Kiat Ng 2016-11-01

    [~perdona] you should be able to attach it to the ticket itself rather than comments. otherwise, you can email to me.
    </li>
<li>Caio Perdona 2016-11-01

    @Chee Kiat Ng Just emailed them to you. </li>
<li>Hans Knöchel 2016-11-01

    [~perdona] Have you been able to isolate the issue so far? Without that, we won't be able to do anything. Thx!</li>
<li>Caio Perdona 2016-11-01

    @Hans Knoechel Actually I haven't. App is crashing in several circumstances, not only on the listView. I thought the logs would be enough and more accurate for you.
    I tried to isolate the issue, but I couldn't get it to crash in a generic snippet... If you really need it, I can work on that.   </li>
<li>Chee Kiat Ng 2016-11-02

    I have attached the crash logs. It's going to be mostly guess work, so if [~perdona] you can isolate the issue, it'll be incredibly helpful. We haven't seen something like this from other folks.</li>

    Resolving as a duplicate of TIMOB-24139 which has been fixed just today. Just found out that the log
    <code><pre>
    5   PiniOn                        	0x100171978 -[ImageCacheEntry imageForSize:scalingStyle:] (ImageLoader.m:157)
    6   PiniOn                        	0x100102d38 +[TiUtils loadBackgroundImage:forProxy:] (TiUtils.m:1994)
    7   PiniOn                        	0x100140a3c -[TiUIButton setBackgroundImage_:] (TiUIButton.m:268)
    </pre></code>
    was exactly what occurred in the other ticket as well. Please try the latest 6.0.0 build which will already include the fix. Thx!</li>
