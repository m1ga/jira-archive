<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Description</h4>

When building to a Windows 10 Mobile emulator I am not receiving any logging, Windows Phone 8.1 emulators work fine. Not sure whether this issue in the Windows side of RN could be related <a href="https://github.com/ReactWindows/react-native-windows/issues/683" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/ReactWindows/react-native-windows/issues/683</a>

* The app does not even connect to the log relay as no <code>Start application log</code>
* This used to work in older versions of the SDK but now it is broken in all versions, which makes me believe it is similar to the above issue and not caused by a regression in Ti SDK but a behaviour change in the Windows emulators 
* I have attempted to run on older emulators but have run into TIMOB-23758 will try master and see if I can get anymore logging
* Devices are not affected

<h4>Steps to reproduce</h4>

<h4>Build to a Windows 10 Mobile emulator <code>appc run -p windows -T wp-emulator -C 10-0-1</code></h4>

<h4>Actual result</h4>

No logging 

<h4>Expected result</h4>

There should be logging

   I was able to reproduce this, I think this was caused because Hyper-V NAT network adapter only uses internal network. I was able to fix this by changing Hyper-V network switch to use external network like below:
   
   <h4>Launch *Hyper-V Manager*</h4>
   <h4>Select local machine and launch *Virtual Switch Manager*</h4>
   <h4>Create new virtual network switch that uses *External network*</h4>
   <h4>Return to *Hyper-V Manager* and select Windows Phone virtual machine</h4>
   <h4>Select *Settings*, select *Emulator NAT Network Adapter* and then changes network adapter to use your external switch</h4>

   I would resolve this ticket as not our bug and we might want to address this workaround in the docs later.</li>
