<h3>Description</h3>

So I have been thinking about this for a while:

Take the page 
<a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#</a>!/api/Titanium.UI.ScrollableView-method-scrollToView

The method list shows a lot of bloat due to the inclusion of getters and setters. As far as I know there is no advantage in using properties over the associated getset-method. So I would hereby suggest the removal of these getters and setters, except for cases where it is actually beneficial to use a getter/setter (due to additional parameters perhaps?).

I know this is a breaking change for almost any app out there, but we could start by deprecating these functionalities and removing them from the API docs. Ambiguity is in no way beneficial to understanding and developing Titanium apps.

   This was actually deprecated in SDK 8.0.0 (and they are scheduled to be removed in SDK 9.0.0)</li>
