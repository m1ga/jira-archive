<h3>Description</h3>

While using a UICollectionView with HyperLoop I've noticed that my app crashes after scrolling the view a few times due to a Segmentation Fault 11 (bad memory address access).

My code is attached in this ticket, along with the crash file.
Example:

<code><pre>
var HL_CollectionView = require('HL_CollectionView');
$.window.add(HL_CollectionView.createCollectionView([
    "1", "2", "3", "4","5", "6", "7", "8","9", "10", "11", "12","13", "14", "15", "16",
    "1", "2", "3", "4","5", "6", "7", "8","9", "10", "11", "12","13", "14", "15", "16",
]));
</pre></code>

After scrolling the collection a little bit, the app crashes.
I've monitored the app on Instruments and apparently it's not a memory leak issue (memory usage stays low). I guess this error is coming from the *cellForItemAtIndexPath* method when i'm changing the labels inside each *UICollectionViewCell*. It's a dirty solution, but it's all we have.

   Hello, Can you try it with latest version 1.2.7? Let us know. Thanks.</li>

   The crash is happening because the JSCore GC deallocated the reference incorrectly in some cases. I know [~jvennemann] is already working on, so reassigning to him! *EDIT*: Might be related to TIMOB-23868.</li>

   Quick heads-up: This still has still not been forgotten and we are working on it. I just moved it out of 2.2.0 so it does not block the release with all other features and improvements. We are trying to do more frequent releases with Hyperloop, so various issues and improvements can be used more easily. We will update this ticket once the core-issue was found, thanks guys!</li>
