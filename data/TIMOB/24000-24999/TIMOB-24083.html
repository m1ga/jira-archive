<h3>Description</h3>

A long time ago Google released the [Android Design Support library](<a href="http://android-developers.blogspot.com.au/2015/05/android-design-support-library.html)." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://android-developers.blogspot.com.au/2015/05/android-design-support-library.html).</a> It allows the usage of Material Design components in all Android 2.1 or higher devices. 

It's been more than two years since Material Design was released and we still don't have access to the components that make up the Android design, and the only way to solve that as of today is trying to replicate them with other Titanium components. 
On the other hand, Titanium received updates to support new iOS features within weeks or even days over the past few years.

   Thanks for submitting the request. Our engineers team will look into it. We will let you know if and when we decided to integrate this feature in our platform. Keep following this ticket. </li>

   Now that's a stupid and unthought answer.
   Have you at least opened the link provided in the issue description? Design Support Library IS NOT the same as Material Design support.
   Wow... Just wow.

   Rodolfo,
   
   We definitely do support the Material design. Titanium Activity class' derive from the Supports library's AppCompatActivity and we include the needed resources for Material design support on older Android OS versions.  The KitchenSink app that Frankie referenced demonstrates that the material theme does get applied to all Android UI widgets Titanium supports (TextFields, Switches, Sliders, etc.).
   
   Or are you asking us to support more Android widgets?  We're not really sure what you're asking for at this point.</li>

   The original description above includes a link to <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2015/05/android-design-support-library.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2015/05/android-design-support-library.html</a> and a request to support that library.
   
   Are you saying that your support for material design includes what is provided by that library? If not, then this ticket shouldn't have been closed (for the reason given).</li>

   Joshua, you should've read the link in the description of this ticket. I can't believe you guys close tickets by just looking at its title. Have some respect with yourself and the users that pay you salary.</li>
<li>Joshua Quick 2017-04-14

   Right, Titanium based Android apps currently uses the "android-support-v7-appcompat.jar" library to apply the material design to its activities and ui/widgets, which we've already added support for to our existing UI components.
   
   If what's being asked for is additional UI components (I suspect that's the case) then those will need to be individual feature requests.  From there, we prioritize feature requests based on demand.  We already have several feature requests listed as shown by Michael G. above.</li>

   Hello all,
   I reopened this ticket so we can get some clarity on what is being requested as there is obviously some confusion on this point. 
   
   [~rdperottoni] I would appreciate it if you scaled back your tone. I can understand your frustration, with staffing changes we have fallen far behind where we want to be. I don't like this any more than you do. But it isn't helpful to call people's responses "stupid" or to tell us to have some respect for ourselves. You have also made similar comments in other tickets and it makes it difficult for me to assign engineers to your tickets because they don't want to be the target of insulting comments. 
   
   So let's move forward. Due to the architecture of the Titanium SDK, each of these UI elements must be supported individually. If we had a list of the components/features you wanted, we could start to implement these items in order of the priority you need them in. We unfortunately can't simply drop in the library. 
   
   If you'd like to email directly to discuss this, I welcome the chance to speak with you. I'm also on ti.slack. If you'd like to get us a list with priority, I'll have the team here create tickets, and you can track the progress.

    Side-note: The latest support library is already available in 6_2_X these days and will be part of 6.2.0 (scheduled for next week). </li>

    Everyone, you can track the new "Design Support" UI features being added to Titanium here: [TIMOB-24638]
    
    As the time this post was written, we've already implemented Toolbar and NavigationDrawer support.</li>
