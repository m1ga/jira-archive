I can understand your frustration, with staffing changes we have fallen far behind where we want to be. I don't like this any more than you do. But it isn't helpful to call people's responses \"stupid\" or to tell us to have some respect for ourselves. You have also made similar comments in other tickets and it makes it difficult for me to assign engineers to your tickets because they don't want to be the target of insulting comments. \r\n\r\nSo let's move forward. Due to the architecture of the Titanium SDK, each of these UI elements must be supported individually. If we had a list of the components/features you wanted, we could start to implement these items in order of the priority you need them in. We unfortunately can't simply drop in the library. \r\n\r\nIf you'd like to email directly to discuss this, I welcome the chance to speak with you. I'm also on ti.slack. If you'd like to get us a list with priority, I'll have the team here create tickets, and you can track the progress.\r\n\r\n",
