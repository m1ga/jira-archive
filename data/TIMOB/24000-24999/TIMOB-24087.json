					"body": "Hi, I have updated to the 5.5.1 GA SDK and no change. I have also ensured that my provisioning profiles are valid, and not managed which shouldn't matter to be honest as the app ID is what is tied to the push notification entitlement and even managed profiles will be hooked into the correct app ID. Finally, I have also ensured that my application does have an entitlements file with the following keys.\r\n\r\n<key>aps-environment</key>\r\n<string>development</string>\r\n\r\nI don't believe any of what you mentioned, maybe expect for the SDK, could have possibly caused this issue as the OS is still requesting permissions. In my experience doing native iOS applications you will not received the permission request dialog if the application is not setup correctly for push notifications and/or if the entitlements file is not correct. There seems to be something fundamentally wrong with the Appcelerator implementation and this needs to be investigated and resolved ASAP as it's causing me to not be able to send out builds to my clients.",

I've also found several bugs over the last few months that I have reported here.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I do feel this is a bug somewhere in the SDK as I've setup push notifications on native apps for years and not once have ever had a problem with my setup. Furthermore, push notifications were working 100% correctly until I updated my device to 10.1. Perhaps the issue is with my device alone, but I doubt it.\r\n\r\nAnyways, I appreciate the time you guys have put into this, but at this time it's just more cost effective for me to move to a native platform.\r\n\r\nThanks!",

					"body": "Hi Hans,\r\n\r\nPlease bear in mind that our decision to move away from Appcelerator wasn't one of haste. I've done my best to fix this application the best I could using this tool, but many issues remain. Yes, you all have invalidated some of my issues which I believe is simply because you couldn't replicate the issues. Just because you're not able to replicate a bug doesn't mean it doesn't exist. However, as an engineer myself I understand it's impossible to fix a bug you can't replicate, so no qualms there.\r\n\r\nI could go on with the laundry list of issues I have on a day-to-day with Appcelerator such as but not limited to the debugger tends to take a very long time to connect to Appcelerator Studio if at all. The fact that debug builds tend to not work when Appcelerator isn't running as they should. The fact that every time I've upgraded the SDK version of Titanium I am using I get crashes left and right, and not to mention that I can't even create a breakpoint in my main JavaScript files. Who in their right mind is going to go into their build directory, load up a built version of the JavaScript file, and then place a breakpoint. That's horrible workflow for debugging and should be corrected to work within the original file. I could go on and tell you that it's horrifying to find in a release build that some people's devices will load the AppIcon while others won't. It seems to be purely the luck of the draw.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I simply do not have time to note every single issue I've ever had with this platform, and I've only been using it for a few months.  The main problem with this product in my opinion it's based on JavaScript. A language that was devised in about 10 days by Brendan Eich. Guy is an awesome engineer, but the entire language was written in 10 days. It doesn't even have a concept of integer values. Yet, this isn't a comment on the shortcomings of the language. I'm simply stating that when you build a house on a pile of sticks, then it's going to crumble at the first storm. Which Appcelerator has time and time again.\r\n\r\nI will say that Appcelerator has great customer service and tech support. I believe you all are truly wanting to help me out, and I believe you cannot replicate the errors. However, that doesn't mean that their nonexistent. Considering everything was hunky dory a few weeks ago before iOS 10.2, Xcode 8.1 and of course the latest offering from the Titanium SDK I have to believe something is wrong with the tech stack and not the code. Especially, considering I pulled it from your own documentation just last week. And yes my app ID has the push notification entitlement, my app has Background Modes enable and does have the remote notifications key as I showed above. In an native app this is all I would need and it would just work.\r\n\r\nI do appreciate the help guys, and I hope you all have a good day.",
