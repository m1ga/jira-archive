<h3>Description</h3>

Below is the list of issues observed in the ListView with  Textfields as ListItems: 

·         We have multiple text fields as List Items in a list view .For android version 5.0.2, we cannot input anything for 2nd or 3rd textfileds onwards .(Textfileds which are at lower part of the screen). When we click on text Fields, the soft keyboard appears and disappears instantly.
 
·         In Android, the application is crashing sometimes when user clicks on the Yes/No button of the list items. On Click of this Yes/No button the Childs question (Textfileds) are added and removed from the list section.
 
·         In IPAD for question no 7b, which has got two child question (text fields), user cannot focus on 2nd question text filed to input data.
 
·         Changing the style of Views in the templates at runtime causing application to hang(non responsive).

   Please isolate the issue into one app.js that can be tested by our support-team. Thanks!</li>

   Hi Hans , 
   
   We are using an alloy framework , if we try to put every thing in app.js , then the problem may dilute  . 
   For you better understanding , the project has just two controllers (index.js & HealthQuestions.js) . Index.js contains a simple button , on clicking that button , the HealthQuestion controller is opened .
   
   HealthQuestion controller populates a ListView by reading the JSON data from data.json under lib folder .
   HealthQuestion controller displays list of Question and sub Question . Question can have Yes/No button , text fields or select options. Below is the description of the functions in the HealthQuestion
   
   loadJsonFile : loads the JSON data from the file into a variable
   populateListView : carete the listView by parsing the JSON data
   createSection : creates the section of the list view by using the JSON data's question tag
   createItem : creates item of the listview
   replaceSection : replaces the section of the listview at the speified index position
    yesButtonClick : called when user clicks on the Yes button of the question
   noButtonClick : called when user clicks on the No button of the question
   textFieldChange : called when the user is changing text in the textfield
   
   
    </li>

   Gotcha. But do we need all that JSON-parsing for a reproducible case? To show the behavior, a custom test-case would be enough and much appreciated by our Android-team. Thanks!</li>

   Since , the items are populated in the ListView , parsing the json is necesarry .
   
   Below is the Test case to reproduce the issue no 1 (*soft keyboard appears and disappears instantly*)
   1.Start the app 
   2.Click on the "Go TO Health Question" Button
   3.Click on the No Button of the 1st Question . Child Question having label Explanation and a TextField will be populated below the parent question
   4.Click on the Yes Button of the 2nd Question. Child Question having label Explanation and a TextField will be populated below the parent question
   5.Input Some text data in the TextFiled of the 1st Question's Child question
   6.Try to Input Some text data in the second textfield data
   7.Soft Keyboard will appear and disappears instantly 
   
   Please let us know if you are able to reproduce this issue , then will post the test case for others too.</li>

   Is there any update on this ? We need to inform the same to client accordingly.</li>

   Hello, I have tried your sample code and followed your guide to reproduce the issue. I was able to regenerate the issue. On the second textfield when I try to put something the soft keyboard opens and disappeared instantly and the cursor goes to the first textfield. The issue is reproducible with Android 5.x.x and The issue is not occurring in Android 6.x.x. Moving the ticket to engineering. Thanks.</li>
