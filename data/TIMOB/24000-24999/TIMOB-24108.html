   [~rmitro] Could you attache a source code for this instead of appxbundle? Also, could you get the exact command line that customer used to build/install the application?</li>

   Let me clear about the environment, your application is installed on Windows Phone 8.1 right? I remember we have experienced similar issues before (TIMOB-20197, TIMOB-23411) At that time application crashes because there's a lot of <code>require</code> and logic executed at startup, and thus application crashes due to "out of memory" kind of error at startup. We have also experienced that Windows Phone tend to "kill" the app when application startup takes time. So I would suggest reducing <code>require</code> as much as possible to make the app faster to load at startup. </li>

   Closing this for now because this ticket seems to be obsolete (I am cleaning up our tickets) and also we are going to drop 8.1 support as of next major release (<code>7.0.0</code>). If this is still the case, please open new ticket.</li>
