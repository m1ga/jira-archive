I remember we have experienced similar issues before (TIMOB-20197, TIMOB-23411) At that time application crashes because there's a lot of `require` and logic executed at startup, and thus application crashes due to \"out of memory\" kind of error at startup. We have also experienced that Windows Phone tend to \"kill\" the app when application startup takes time. So I would suggest reducing `require` as much as possible to make the app faster to load at startup. ",
