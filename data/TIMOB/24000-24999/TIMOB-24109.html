<h3>Description</h3>

Customer is facing following problem, not able to use "Kinvey" as third party pod/framework.

<h4>Reproduce</h4>

1. Create a default app. 
2. Add Podfile into project like following:
<code><pre>
install! 'cocoapods', :integrate_targets =&gt; false
platform :ios, '10.0'
use_frameworks!

target 'AlloyHyperloop' do		
    pod 'Kinvey'
end

post_install do |installer|
  installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
    target.build_configurations.each do |config|
      config.build_settings['SWIFT_VERSION'] = '3.0'
    end
  end
end
</pre></code>
3. Add following code into app.js file
<code><pre>
var APPKEY = 'kid_r1ME5mgA';
var APPSECRET = '9bef50c0843d4860984b543ea2fde4ff';

// ** This is regularly the username and password that is also used to log in to the app ** //
var USERNAME = 'cenciso';
var PASSWORD = 'cenciso';

try {
	var Kin = require('Kinvey/Kinvey');
	var Kinvey = new Kin();
	console.log('Kinvey: ' + JSON.stringify(Kinvey));
	Kinvey.sharedClient.initialize({
			appKey: APPKEY,
			appSecret: APPSECRET
	});
} catch (_error) {
	console.warn('- Error Loading Kinvey Module: ' + _error);
}
</pre></code>
4. Run the app on simulator or device (iOS 10)

<h4>Problem.</h4>

App will crash.

<h4>Note</h4>

Customer confirmed with Kinvey's development team, they are able to using it in native code, and which is working well.

   I see a few issues with the example code, let me check the SDK and provide a full sample code that works. Please also attach full crash log, full environment e.g. Hyperloop version and SDK version.</li>

   Looking at the crash file, it seems to imply that KeychainAccess.framework is missing (which i assume is a 3rd party framework that came with the pod). So one possibility is to add this into appc.js. (assuming the framework is in a 'src' folder in project root)
   
   <code><pre>
   	hyperloop: {
   		ios: {
   			xcodebuild: {
   				/**
   				 * any flags available to be passed into the Xcode can be
   				 * included here to further customize the xcode build
   				 */
   				flags: {
   					FRAMEWORK_SEARCH_PATHS: '../../src'
   				},
   				frameworks: [
   					'KeychainAccess'
   				]
   			},
   			/**
   			 * optionally, you can bring in third-party or first-party libraries,
   			 * source code, resources etc. by including them here. The 'key' is the
   			 * name of the package that will be used in the require (if code).
   			 * the values can either be an Array or String value to the directory
   			 * where the files are located
   			 */
   			thirdparty: {
   				'KeychainAccess': {
   					// these can be an array or string
   					source: ['src'],
   					header: 'src',
   					resource: 'src'
   				}
   			}
   		}
   	}
   </pre></code>
   However, this is guesswork. Would prefer to have more information please. </li>

   [~sliang], the Kinvey SDK is written in Swift and therefore requires <code>use_framework!</code> directive. However, this is not supported by Hyperloop yet. The first iteration of this feature is planned for Hyperloop 2.1.0. Unfortunately i can't give an estimated release date for this at the moment, but they have several other options:
   
   * Kinvey has a SDK for Titanium at <a href="https://github.com/Kinvey/titanium-sdk" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/Kinvey/titanium-sdk</a> which means it's not necessarily required to use Hyperloop to work with Kinvey
   * They can try using the 1.x version of the SDK, which is written in Objective-C, with <code>pod 'KinveyKit'</code>.
   
   Let me know if they have any other questions. If not i'll close this as a duplicate of TIMOB-23570.</li>

   Thanks a lot. Will inform customer. Will notice you once get reply.</li>
<li>Jan Vennemann 2017-04-25

   [~sliang], just in case you want an update for the customer: The fix for this is currently under review and set to be included in Hyperloop 2.2.0, not in 2.1.0 as i mentioned in my previous comment. For further updates please check TIMOB-23570 for which I'll close this as a duplicate of.</li>
