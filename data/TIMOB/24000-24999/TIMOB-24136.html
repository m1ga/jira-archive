<h3>Description</h3>

Create a new Titanium app and try to run it with <code>appc run</code> or <code>ti build</code>. The build succeeds, but the app never starts:

<code><pre>
[TRACE] ** BUILD SUCCEEDED **
[INFO]  Finished building the application in 16s 518ms
[INFO]  Launching iOS Simulator
[TRACE] [ioslib] Selected iOS Simulator: iPhone 7 Plus
[TRACE] [ioslib]   UDID    = B1E64A97-DC1C-482D-BA35-CCC66CFF1479
[TRACE] [ioslib]   iOS     = 10.2

</pre></code>

I do have two active Xcode installations running as usual, so I specified <code>-I 10.2</code> to force running with Xcode 8.2. That does not help. Maybe it's just my environment, but if not, we should have it on our schedule between 6.0.0 and 6.1.0.

*EDIT*: Also tried to delete Xcode 8.1 to not have two Xcode-installs at the same time and additionally tried to rename <code>Xcode-beta</code> to <code>Xcode</code>, all the same behavior. I also changed the <code>xcode-select</code> path everytime to ensure the right one gets selected.

   [~emerriman] [~cng] We should think about which release this ticket should be fixed in: 6.0.x or 6.1.0? 6.0.1 is quite near, 6.1.0 quite far away.</li>

   To test, try to build an iOS app using iOS SDK 10.2 for a 10.2 iOS Simulator. It should install and launch.</li>
<li>Sebastian Klaus 2016-12-13

   Tested and works. Thanks </li>
<li>Chris Bowley 2016-12-13

   Is this really going to wait until 6.1? iOS 10.2 / Xcode 8.2 was released today.</li>
<li>Kiley Williams 2016-12-13

   +1 to Chris Bowley's comment above. A lot of people will be hitting this very soon. I'm having to revert to Xcode 8.1 right now.
   
   Thanks for fixing it quickly!</li>
<li>Thomas Neerup 2016-12-13

   I'm with Chris Bowley. Please fix this in 6.0.1
   Thanks

<li>Martin Williamson 2016-12-13

   Xcode 8.2 has been released public now, glad I came and checked here after getting this issue. Have restored XCode 8.1 but expect some more reports of issues.</li>

    u rly fucked up with this, its a huge blocker to all devs cuz installing failes for developing on simulator.
    
    i searched almost 8 hours for the error now, no logging, no announcing, nothing from ur side, except a *+resolved+* ticket which i found now.
    
    bring up this fix fast now!</li>
<li>Chris Barber 2016-12-15

    [~ns] Technically it was Apple's fault. They broke <code>simctl getenv</code> in Xcode 8.2 which caused our stuff to break. :)
    
    Also, we did post a notification about Xcode 8.2 support, albeit on Slack: <a href="https://ti-slack.slack.com/archives/announcements/p1481646381000035." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ti-slack.slack.com/archives/announcements/p1481646381000035.</a>
    
    Titanium generally does not officially support beta releases of software (i.e. Xcode). Since Xcode 8.2 was just released after we shipped Titanium SDK 6.0.0, naturally 6.0.0 doesn't support Xcode 8.2. Now that Xcode 8.2 is out, Titanium SDK 6.0.1 DOES support Xcode 8.2. Feel free to grab a CI build from <a href="http://builds.appcelerator.com." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://builds.appcelerator.com.</a> Be of TIMOB-24227 which I'm going to fix today.</li>
<li>Thomas Neerup 2016-12-15

    Hi Chris is there an official place for these notifications? </li>
<li>Chris Barber 2016-12-15

    [~thomas.neerup@eg.dk] I'm not sure. Appc has a dev blog, a Twitter account, and a Slack channel. I only have access to the Slack channel. I could post stuff on my personal Twitter account.</li>
<li>Eric Merriman  2016-12-21

    Support is available in SDK 6.0.1.v20161217061750.</li>
<li>Dan Tamas 2016-12-22

    Cpuld this fix be back-ported to 5.5.1 ?</li>
<li>Hans Knöchel 2016-12-22

    [~dan_tamas] There won't be a 5.5.x patch for this, since other CLI adjustments are necessary as well to work with Xcode 8.2. But feel free to patch your 5.5.x version with the related commits, as all of them are open source.</li>
<li>Dan Tamas 2016-12-22

    Ok, where do I find all the changes? Before it used to be a comment with the PR(s) fixing the bug, but in this one... :)</li>
<li>Dan Tamas 2016-12-22

    [~hansknoechel] ^^^</li>
<li>Hans Knöchel 2016-12-22

    TIMOB-24136, TIMOB-24219, TIMOB-24219, TIMOB-24227 and TIMOB-24241 are Xcode 8.2 fixes :-)</li>
<li>Chris Barber 2016-12-22

    [~rborn] Start by updating <code>ioslib</code> in the <code>node_modules</code> directory. That will solve the 2 major problems with <code>simctl genenv</code> and the CoreSimulator service switching.</li>
<li>Dan Tamas 2016-12-22

    thnx</li>
<li>Jason Kneen 2016-12-23

    [~rborn] -- I've started a PR for 5.5.x branch -- basically updating ioslib to latest fixed it for me -- thanks for the help [~cbarber]</li>
