<h3>Description</h3>

While testing our pre-GA version with some of my bigger apps, I noticed that the build will fail if one of my modules has the <code>apiversion</code> set to <code>3</code> in the iOS manifest (not Android). Did we ever propose to bump this version, e.g. while updating to 64 bit architecture? 

This does *not fail* on Titanium SDK < 6.0.0, e.g. 5.5.1.GA, so it's a regression or at least change of behavior. I guess it's caused by a CLI change that checks something for our Android modules.

So at least, we should print a better error than just:
<code><pre>
[ERROR] Found incompatible Titanium Modules:
[ERROR]    id: com.widbook.brightness	 version: 1.0.1	 platform: ios,iphone	 min sdk: 3.1.0.GA
 </pre></code>

   We are not expecting iOS modules to change API version from 2 to 3 though. iOS modules are not expected to work with API version 3 in 6.</li>

   iOS does not have a apiversion 3. It should fail if you change the apiversion to 3 for iOS modules. Just because we never validated it before doesn't mean that this is a breaking change. It was invalid before we added validation and it's still invalid.
   
   [~eharris] What's the point? Modules are tied to the Titanium SDK that was used when you create them, so tying them to the apiversion too isn't a big deal. If you're savvy enough to update the minsdk version in the <code>manifest</code> and the hard-coded SDK paths in the <code>titanium.xcconfig</code>, then you're savvy enough to know what the apiversion of whichever SDK you want to use and how to set it.</li>

   Closing as invalid. If incorrect, please reopen.</li>
