<h3>Description</h3>

Prospect is highlighting concerns around needing to click through multiple windows within their application to see the effects of the changes on the screen after making changes to the code.

In short, if a screen 4 clicks away from first screen of the app, developer has to click through 4 times to see the validation of the changes made on screen 4. This is both time consuming not very effective.

It would be very beneficial to include some kind of "Hot Reload" capability to take the developer to screen 4 (for example) to improve productivity and usability.
