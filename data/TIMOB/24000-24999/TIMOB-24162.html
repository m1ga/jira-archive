<h3>Description</h3>

The current config.json file only allows a specific set of environments. According to the manual, some of these are tightly coupled to running on a 'device'  or running on an 'emulator'.

This setup restricts a lot of freedom for the developers. Nor does it provide ease of use, since we cant select a certain config for a certain build.

This might has to do with the <code>titanium build -D/\-\-deploy\-type</code> command, in how that selects the correct config.
The problem I'm having is that the <code>env:test</code> in my config.json is currently empty because I cant use it. <code>env:test</code> is bound to be used on testing on a device, while i actually want it to run unit tests no matter what target i deploy it onto.

   iOS Simulator and Android emulator builds have a default deploy target of "development". This can be overwritten using the <code>\-\-deploy-type test</code> CLI option.

   You cannot change the deploy type for distribution builds as they will always be production.
   
   However, TIMOB-16869 most closely describes the ultimate goal here of decoupling settings from a deploy type. Resolving as a duplicate.</li>
