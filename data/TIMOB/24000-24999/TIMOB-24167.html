<h3>Description</h3>

I'm trying to run a Firebase project on Android using Hyperloop and I'm not being able to do it with any of the SDK / hyperloop versions.

If I use the SDK 5.5.1.GA and Hyperloop version 1.2.7 or 1.2.8 I get the issue attached on the file "issue-551GA".
If I use the SDK 6.0.0 and Hyperloop version 2.0.0 I get the issue attached on the file "issue-600".

If I could get what the issue is I would say that it's something related to how the Firebase works with the Android SDK. It's not a standalone project where you just have to include in your .gradle file and export your .aar file. Firebase works a bit differently because it's embedded in the Android SDK (Because it's a CORE package in the Android SDK). I think Hyperloop is not ready for this kind of scenario, but I can be wrong.

   Did you try <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/37598691/noclassdeffounderror-com-google-firebase-firebaseoptions?" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/37598691/noclassdeffounderror-com-google-firebase-firebaseoptions?</a></li>

   Hi @hans. I just tried what you suggested and I got another issue.
   It looks like I need to activate MultiDex for Android.
   
   So, I've done two different tests:
   
   1) Adding the multidex aar to the project and running it. The issue I got is attached with the name: "1issue" 
   2) Adding the multidex aar AND adding the property 'android:name' to the '<application>' tag on tiapp.xml. The issue I got is attached as well with the name: "2issue".
   
   </li>

   I always get these lines when the app:
   
   [INFO]  MultiDex: VM with version 2.1.0 has multidex support
   [INFO]  MultiDex: install
   [INFO]  MultiDex: VM has multidex support, *MultiDex support library is disabled.*</li>

   I tried to include the module "ti.map" aiming to sort the issue with google services and it helped. 
   I'm not getting the issue with gms anymore, however the problem with "ClassNotFoundException" still persists.

   Hello, Try with latest release 2.0.0 with SDK 6.0.0.GA. Thanks.</li>

   Have you tested with the latest version Sharif?
   
   I've just tested and it's triggering the same 6.0.0.* issue.
