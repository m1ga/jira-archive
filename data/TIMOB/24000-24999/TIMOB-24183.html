<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Issue Description</h4>

I am not able to build an app on a windows phone with the SDK 6.1.0. I get this error:

[ERROR] :  Invalid "--device-id" value "0"

If I try using the CLI, it says no device is connected.

However, it works with SDK 5.5.1, so I think this is a regression bug.

   FYI: I tried with 2 devices and I get the same error...</li>

   Same problem for me, my device is recognized by my pc but CLI says there is no device...</li>

   Hi, any news about this issue?Thanks</li>
<li>Joachim Deneumostier 2016-11-15

   I alse tried with the SDK 6.0.0. GA and it doesn't work neither. Could you check please?</li>

   Hi,
   Sorry for the inconvenience. Are you trying to build on Windows Phone Emulator or devices ? Please try to build with CLI and let us know if you get error again.

   Hi, I'm trying to build the app on a windows device. I've already tried to build using the cli and I get the same error.
   The emulator works fine. 
   
   Thanks!</li>

   Tested, this is a regression , it works on 5.5.1 GA </li>

   This sounds familiar for me. Can you use <code>uuid</code> instead of number value <code>0</code> for <code>--device-id</code>?  You can get your devices <code>uuid</code> by running following command, that should show <code>Devices</code> section for your connected devices.
   
   <code><pre>
   appc ti info -p windows -o json
   </pre></code>
   
   If this still show no devices for you, I suspect this has to something to do with TIMOB-23976. Could you guys check if Windows 10 Emulators are installed on your environment?
   </li>
<li>Joachim Deneumostier 2016-12-01

   Hi,
   
   I installed both windows 8.1 and 10 emulators with Visual Studio but I don't see the windows 10 emulators (only the 8) in the Appcelerator Studio. 
   The result of this command shows that there are no windows 10 emulators and no no devices connected.

    [~joachim] Let me clear about the environment to separate the issue...Does following command show Windows 10 emulators for you? Or only Appcelerator Studio does not list the emulators?
    
    <code><pre>
    appc ti info -p windows -o json
    </pre></code>
    
    If Windows 10 emulators are not listed in the command above, I suspect if Visual Studio installation is broken. Would you try "Repair" in the Visual Studio installer if that's the case?</li>
<li>Joachim Deneumostier 2016-12-06

    Hi,
    
    I don't see the windows 10 emulators in the studio but they have installed with Visual Studio. I've already tried the "repair" action in the Visual Studio, but no luck...
    I've tried on two computers, same issue.
    
    Thanks</li>
<li>Kota Iguchi 2016-12-07

    [~joachim] Do you see any emulators and devices when you run following command in Windows PowerShell? <code>appc ti info -p windows -o json</code> Also, do you have <code>C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\bin\x86\WinAppDeployCmd.exe</code> installed on your PC? If so what's the outtput from <code>WinAppDeployCmd devices</code> command?

<li>Joachim Deneumostier 2016-12-12

    Hi, It gives me the same result as Studio does...empty result for windows 10 emulators and devises...</li>
<li>Kota Iguchi 2016-12-16

    In that case I strongly think that Visual Studio installation is broken. In case "Repair" doesn't work, I would try clean-uninstall Visual Studio. I haven't try this but Microsoft provides a document about Visual Studio "Total Uninstaller" here: <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt720585.aspx" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt720585.aspx</a>

    It works with previous SDK versions as I said before... People at Appcelerator admitted this is a regression bug. We are waiting for a patch for this issue.</li>
<li>Kota Iguchi 2016-12-19

    Would you paste your <code>appc ti info -p windows -o json</code> ? Output from <code>WinAppDeployCmd devices</code> may help too.</li>
<li>Joachim Deneumostier 2016-12-19

    Info already sent to people at Appcelerator.  They admitted this is a regression bug. We are waiting for a patch for this issue.</li>
<li>Kota Iguchi 2016-12-20

    Why don't you attach output form <code>appc ti info -p windows -o json</code> as well as output from <code>WinAppDeployCmd devices</code> on this ticket so we can look into see what's exactly happening there?</li>
<li>Joachim Deneumostier 2016-12-29

    Hi, I don't think I have the rights to attach files, could you please check? thanks.</li>
<li>Kota Iguchi 2017-01-02

    Hmm I don't have the rights to change the permission. Can you paste it into this comment area using formatting notation *\{code\} \{code\}*?</li>
<li>Kota Iguchi 2017-01-03

    What will be happening when you specify <code>--wp-sdk 8.1</code> explicitly when you build the app?
    
    <code><pre>
    appc run -p windows --wp-sdk 8.1 --target wp-device -l trace
    </pre></code>
    </li>
