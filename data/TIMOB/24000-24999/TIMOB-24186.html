<h3>Description</h3>

I'm trying to use the Dropbox Official cocoa pod with Hyperloop and found an issue while trying to require an specific file with a special character "+".
The official Dropbox documentation tells us to require only one file:

<code><pre>
#import &lt;ObjectiveDropboxOfficial/ObjectiveDropboxOfficial.h&gt;
</pre></code>

I know I can't require only this single file with Hyperloop (Which make the things harder for developers) and I have to require every single file I'm willing to use, so I've created the following requires:

<code><pre>
var DropboxClient = require('ObjectiveDropboxOfficial/DropboxClient');
var DropboxClientsManager = require('ObjectiveDropboxOfficial/DropboxClientsManager');
var DropboxTeamClient = require('ObjectiveDropboxOfficial/DropboxTeamClient');
var ObjectiveDropboxOfficial = require('ObjectiveDropboxOfficial/ObjectiveDropboxOfficial');
var MobileAuth = require('ObjectiveDropboxOfficial/DropboxClientsManager+MobileAuth');
</pre></code>

All of them work fine apart from the last one "/DropboxClientsManager+MobileAuth". 
All of them are specified as a "public header". 

I do think the issue might be the special character when Hyperloop created the wrappers. 

This is my podfile:

<code><pre>
install! 'cocoapods',
         :integrate_targets =&gt; false

platform :ios, '8.0'
target 'tidropbox' do
    pod 'ObjectiveDropboxOfficial'
end
</pre></code>

   The "special character" indicates a category that should not be required directly. Instead, the metabase should add the functionality to the related class. So in your case, you would only need to require <code>var DropboxClientsManager = require('ObjectiveDropboxOfficial/DropboxClientsManager');</code> and the related category methods should be available. If not, it's a new feature request to support categories in metabases.</li>

   @hans I've just tried your and it didn't work. I believe the categories are not being generated in the metabase.
   
   My code to test:
   
   <code><pre>
   var DropboxClientsManager = require('ObjectiveDropboxOfficial/DropboxClientsManager');
   
   function doClick(e) {
       var test = DropboxClientsManager.setupWithAppKey('hs7wlr0a1d1chiy');
   }
   
   $.index.open();
   
   </pre></code>
   
   It did create the wrapper, but without the functions of its category. 
   
   
   <code><pre>
   [ERROR] message = "undefined is not a function (evaluating 'DropboxClientsManager.setupWithAppKey(\"hs7wlr0a1d1chiy\")')";
   </pre></code>
   
   Hope it helps.</li>

   Hoping this is given priority as the issue is blocking the development of a very important module...</li>

   [~xicovarisco_orange] This ticket was created less than 2 weeks ago. We will look into it after the 6.0.0.GA release.</li>
<li>Matthew Delmarter 2016-12-21

   Can this be included in 6.1.0 please? Similar to TIMOB-23853 (which has already been prioritised) this issue is blocking using HyperLoop with a key framework (in this case Dropbox), which is one of the main reasons I upgraded to the Pro subscription several weeks ago :/</li>
<li>Hans Knöchel 2017-03-03

   This will be part of Hyperloop 2.0.1 already. The release is a bit behind schedule, since we took in more fixed then planned. Anyway, the Dropbox SDK causes a different issue, since they use generic types (e.g. <code>NSArray&lt;T&gt;</code>) which we are currently looking into. To speed-up the whole process, that one will rather be in 2.0.2. I hope that insight will help, thx!
   
   *EDIT*: For the specific Dropbox generics ticket, please follow-up in TIMOB-24450.</li>
