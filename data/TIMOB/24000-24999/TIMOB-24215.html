<h3>Description</h3>

H5. Issue Description

The web view that loads the content is very slow. It is much slower then before. Trying any URL including appcelerator homepage and no matter what It loads even simple homepage with limited resources the scrolling a painfull

The same webview was used on Ti SDK 3.2 a year ago to produce the same app structure for the app called "Allt om" in Google Play. That app with same prerequisite is scrolling just fine. So something happened during this way. even set the border radius to 1 to enable SW render is not working.

So in summary, the same app build with Ti 3.2 a year ago produced a web view and content that was scrolling and loading just fine (see the app "allt om" at google play sweden <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=se.alltomvasterbotten)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=se.alltomvasterbotten)</a> but the same code now produces a super slow web view which has problems scrolling.

I even tried to set the same URL (allt om) and it produces a slow web view..

<h4>Steps to reproduce</h4>

<h4>Download the code</h4>
<h4>Run </h4>
<h4>Scroll and compare the performance with the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=se.alltomvasterbotten" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=se.alltomvasterbotten</a> app</h4>

   I couldn't get your app to run correctly, but I looked at the code and narrowed it down to this:
   
   <code><pre>
   var w = Ti.UI.createWindow(),
       wv = Ti.UI.createWebView({url: '<a href="http://event.katrineholm.se/?app=true" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://event.katrineholm.se/?app=true</a>'});
   w.add(wv);
   w.open();
   </pre></code>
   
   The scrolling performance seem fine, I'll check to see if there's anything your app is doing that might affect this.</li>
