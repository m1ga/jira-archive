<h3>Description</h3>

Ti.App.Properties currently has a load of bloat functions which do not add anything but confusion.

I suggest using a plain function like:

<code>Ti.App.Properties.set('myKey', mixedValue)</code>;
<code>Ti.App.Properties.get('myKey');</code> (will then return either an object/array/string/number, depending on what you've set).

And discard all functions like <code>setList</code>, <code>setObject</code>, <code>setString</code>, <code>getList</code>, <code>getObject</code>, <code>getString</code>.

Also instead of having <code>Ti.App.Properties.removeAllProperties()</code>, we should aim for a concise naming like <code>Ti.App.Properties.clear()</code>. We are already in the Properties namespace so no need to repeat it in any of it's functions.

   Simple but effective hack for your own project:
   
   <code><pre>
   Alloy.Globals.Properties.set = function(key, val) {
       return Ti.App.Properties.setString(key, JSON.stringify(val));
   }
   
   Alloy.Globals.Properties.get = function(key, default) {
       var val = Ti.App.Properties.getString(key);
       if(val === undefined) {
           return default;
       }
       return JSON.parse(val);
   }
   </pre></code>
   
   Obviously this has a much better place in the SDK itself, but this does the job, and works correctly on objects, strings, numbers and booleans.

   The <code>Ti.App.Properties</code> namespace is meant to handle types specifically, that's why the getString, getInt, getBoolean, etc. were introduced. There are no plans to change this behavior, since it would bring no functional benefit for the users, but would require a major code-rewrite to all platforms, as well as for the developers using our API's.</li>

   It would bring functional benefit to the programmer. However I can see it being an issue since this likely has to do with the way it is being saved on the native side.
   
   The current setup does bring confusion to the situation though since one can do *Ti.App.Properties.getBoolean('foobar')* and *Ti.App.Properties.getString('foobar')*. I currently have no clue what happens in this case, if you save the same variable name to different types.</li>
