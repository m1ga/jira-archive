<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Issue description </h4>

a) Navigation will only go forward
Steps to reproduce:
1.- Launch the app
2.- From the menu in the left, pick 'Controls' 
3.- From the menu in the right, pick 'Views' 
4.- From the menu in the right, pick 'Views'
5.- Observe how there's no way to go back in the navigation, therefore it's not possible to select any of the previous options in the menu unless you kill the app.
Note: these steps are an example of the case, but it's replicable on pretty much any option or menu in the app.

b) 3D touch options will lead to a red screen
Steps to reproduce:
1.- Launch the app
2.- From the menu in the left, pick 'Phone'
3.- From the menu in the right, pick '3D touch: Shortcut Items' or '3D touch: peek and pop"
4.- Observe the red screen and click 'dismiss'. The app becomes unusable at this point.
If this is iphone only, these options should not be presented in windows.

   The KitchenSink 2.0 app does not support Windows so far. There is active work in progress by [~eharris], but it is not merged, yet.</li>
<li>Kota Iguchi 2018-06-26

   I believe this issue has been fixed for now. Feel free to open new ticket if that's not the case.</li>
