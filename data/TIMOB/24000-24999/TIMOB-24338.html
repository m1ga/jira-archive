   Hello, Make sure you are running on the latest SDK, Node, Xcode. This should make sure app build successfully and asking to launch manually by console log. And iOS device build is always done by manually launching the app. Thanks.</li>

   Hello, Update your node and JDK version, And send the full log as text file on device build. </li>

   Hello, This is weird but sometime changing the password of your Appcelerator account seems to pass the stuck issue. Could you change your Appcelerator account password and try logging into the studio and try building again.
   
   In any case please provide the following log as text file in this ticket.
   
   Run "appc info trace"
   Go to studio/help/studio/run diagnostic log. Attach the log in the ticket.
   
   Reply with your findings, Thanks.

   Hello, I have the same problem. Changing password do not effect.
   
   By appc info trace I find only this relevant error. 
   
   !  Unable to find any valid iOS adhoc provisioning profiles.
        This will prevent you from packaging apps for adhoc distribution.
        You will need to log in to <a href="http://appcelerator.com/ios-dist-certs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://appcelerator.com/ios-dist-certs</a> with your Apple Developer
        account, then create, download, and install a profile.
