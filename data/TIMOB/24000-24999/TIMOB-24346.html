   I was not able to reproduce the error with 6.0.0.GA, 6.0.1.GA or the latest 6.0.2 app. The app was reported to occur when trying to run the [appc-sample-watchos2](<a href="https://github.com/appcelerator-developer-relations/appc-sample-watchos2)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator-developer-relations/appc-sample-watchos2)</a> app, which built successfully for me. The error suggests a problem with the MediaModule.m, but that didn't seem to cause issues for me as well.
   
   *EDIT*: Looking at the trace logs you sent me, you're trying to run the SDK 6+ with Xcode 7. Please use Xcode 8 for SDK 6 and later, due to changes in the Xcode CLI we support in latest releases.</li>

   Thanks for the email-discussion Nikita. Resolving this ticket as <code>Invalid</code>, here are the things to check for people getting similar issues:
   - Ensure you have Xcode 8+ and Titanium SDK 5.5.0+ installed
   - Ensure you have the <code>&lt;team-id&gt;</code> set in your tiapp.xml
   - Ensure the bundle identifier of your watchOS extension has the same name then the one from your app (Or use <code> $(PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER)</code> to ensure the same).</li>
