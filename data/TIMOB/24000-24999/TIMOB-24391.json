		"description": "When running an app in Xcode 8.3 Beta, it works fine. But when I include a module that has Bitcode enabled (like Hyperloop and all new modules by default), I get a the following build error:\r\n{code}\r\n[TRACE] error: Invalid bitcode signature\r\n\r\n[TRACE] clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)\r\n\r\n[ERROR] ** BUILD FAILED **\r\n\r\n[ERROR] The following build commands failed:\r\n\r\n[ERROR]         Ld build/Intermediates/fbtest.build/Debug-iphoneos/fbtest.build/Objects-normal/arm64/fbtest normal arm64\r\n\r\n[ERROR] (1 failure)\r\n{code}\r\nYou can force a Xcode 8.3 build using {{appc run -p ios -I 10.3 --log-level trace}} which will select Xcode 8.3 to build the iOS 10.3 target app. I was able to reproduce this error using the [hyperloop-examples|https://github.com/appcelerator/hyperloop-examples] app, but not with Ti.Facebook so far - which still needs to investigated.\r\n\r\nIn general, this is no valid {{Bug}} so far, so it's marked as a {{Story}}. In case it get's validated to be one, here are some possible solutions:\r\n- Enabled Bitcode in the Titanium SDK\r\n  - Question: Was there a reason that this wasn't enabled when we enabled it in modules?\r\n- Disable Bitcode in all our code-modules\r\n  - Hopefully not, it would be a breaking change\r\n\r\nNote: This is *not happening* on Simulator builds. Unfortunately, I didn't see many reports online so far, so it *may* be caused by the Beta version. But we're still in a very early Beta process of Xcode 8.3, so we can investigate this without problems.\r\n\r\n*UPDATE 1*: This is also *not happening* with other native modules like ti.facebook. So it may be related to the Hyperloop metabase compiler.\r\n*UDPATE 2*: The build also *works* when including Hyperloop in a new project, so hyperloop-examples seems to be the only effected one so far. Maybe one of the Cocoapods dependencies is causing the issue.\r\n*UPDATE 3*: Tracked it down to the Cocoapods dependencies. Manually disabling bitcode in the Podfile fixes it (as a workaround):\r\n{code:ruby}\r\npost_install do |installer|\r\n  installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|\r\n    target.build_configurations.each do |config|\r\n      config.build_settings['ENABLE_BITCODE'] = 'NO'\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n{code}\r\nor manually injecting the the bitcode build-setting (preferred):\r\n{code}\r\npost_install do |installer|\r\n  installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|\r\n    target.build_configurations.each do |config|\r\n      cflags = config.build_settings['OTHER_CFLAGS'] || ['$(inherited)']\r\n      cflags << '-fembed-bitcode'\r\n      config.build_settings['OTHER_CFLAGS'] = cflags\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n{code}\r\n*UPDATE 4*: I was now able to reproduce it with a different project as well, also using Hyperloop. It is attached in the first comment.\r\n*UPDATE 5*: It does *not* fail the build when using a native project using Cocoapods and Bitcode disabled.",
