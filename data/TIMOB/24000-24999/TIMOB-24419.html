<h3>Description</h3>

I have tried dozens of C++ Cocoapods and none of them are able to generate a metabase or generate js code. Example Cocoapods include, eigen, OpenCV, MailCore2. Literally any Cocoapods that packaged either cpp or mm files cannot currently be used by Hyperloop.

Ideally, it would be nice to use C++ libraries via Hyperloop in both iOS and Android.

*edited by [~hansknoechel]*: Cleaning up ticket description, this is a feature that will be scheduled in the future.

   Hello, This should be a new feature. Our engineers will consider it. </li>

   if this is a new feature then PLEASE expose it for iOS and for Android via some kind of JNI reflection. 
   
   If it were possible to take a C++ library and write the same code (more or less) in javascript to access the C++ libs API, that would make this capability significantly more useful.</li>
