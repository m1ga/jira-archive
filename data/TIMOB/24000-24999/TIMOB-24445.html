   Hey Itay, this ticket has plenty of information missing:
   
   * Which SDK version?
   * Which CLI version?
   * Which Xcode version?
   * How does your tiapp.xml look like?
   * With iTunes Store, you mean App Store?</li>
<li>Itay Avtalyon 2017-01-31

   First of all, I'm surprised that ticket was submitted at all as I got an error submitting this through the Studio.
   
   SDK: 5.5.1.GA
   CLI: 6.1.0
   XCode: 8.0 (8A218a)
   
   Trying to build app for both iPad and iPhone. Took multiple tries to get one I can upload to the App Store (test flight) with Application Loader. Other reasons for failure: App was compiled as a Mac app, and one time the package missed .app (or something like that).</li>
<li>Hans Knöchel 2017-01-31

   Ok, then the first thing you need to do is to upgrade both Xcode (8.2) and the SDK (6.0.1.GA) to the latest version. The CLI looks fine!</li>
<li>Itay Avtalyon 2017-01-31

   I would love to upgrade the SDK but, alas, this version has a major bug (android back button event is not called) so I am stuck with this SDK version... :(</li>
<li>Hans Knöchel 2017-02-01

   Then 6.0.2 this month will be your solution :-) Try out the latest 6.0.2 nightly today!</li>
<li>Hans Knöchel 2017-02-01

   And please confirm that this is also happening when packaging through the CLI (using <code>appc ti build -p ios -T dist-appstore</code>). If it works there, it's probably a Studio issue. Thx!</li>

   Hello [~itayavtalyon], Can you follow up with [~hansknoechel], comment? Is the issue still present?</li>
<li>Itay Avtalyon 2017-03-01

   Just used the command line last night and at first it did not produce the required icons (for the first time). Previous times I used the command line it worked flawlessly.</li>
<li>Hans Knöchel 2017-03-01

   Ok, to confirm: You tried with 6.0.2.GA as well (released yesterday)? If not, please do so. If you did and it still didn't help, we'd need an example project that reproduces this issue. You could attach it here and we'd actually try to submit it. Please also attach the asset catalog and/or the images you are using. We're taking this very serious, thank you!</li>
