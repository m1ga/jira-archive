<h3>Description</h3>

The docs state that liveview is bound to be used with Appcelerator Studio. I am not using Appcelerator Studio for the simple fact that it is hellishly slow: the frequent project indexing, opening files, tiapp.xml editor, dashboard... most of the functionalities are sub-par and I'd therefore prefer using a proper editor like PhpStorm.

However, the *--liveview* directive does not seem to work by itself when I execute the build command like *appc ti build -p ios -T simulator --liveview*. I've had it working in the past _without the use of Appcelerator Studio_, by reasons I could not explain (possibly installing the Appcelerator Studio changed some config settings in the CLI?).

I am a 100% sure using the studio is not a technical requirement. Having the --liveview option available to everyone is a requirement though, because development is already slow enough using this platform. Replacement modules like TiShadow, and buggy implementations like [here](<a href="https://jolicode.com/blog/alloy-selective-compilation-for-an-even-faster-titanium-development-process)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://jolicode.com/blog/alloy-selective-compilation-for-an-even-faster-titanium-development-process)</a> arent an option since they're 1) hard to implement 2) underdeveloped and 3) buggy.

I wonder what Appcelerator's view is on this.

   Hello, Doc: <a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#</a>!/guide/Appcelerator_Command-Line_Interface_Reference clearly states that Appcelerator studio is required to use --Liveview in your build command. Thanks for submitting the ticket. We will consider The request for Liveview to be available for CLI build without studio. Thanks.</li>

   We finally shipped liveview in the SDK since 8.0.0, so I'm going to close this as fixed.
   
   Thanks for this ticket [~uzbbert]!</li>
