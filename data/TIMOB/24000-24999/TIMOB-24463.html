   Looks like an issue with APSAnalytics. It may or may not be caused by [this line](<a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/aps_sdk/blob/master/ios/support/analytics/APSAnalytics/APSAnalytics.m#L181)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/aps_sdk/blob/master/ios/support/analytics/APSAnalytics/APSAnalytics.m#L181)</a> (private repo) executing the requeueing in a different sync-queue than the one calling it. I saw this a few times in sim-builds, but never took a detailed look into it. As it's really really hard to reproduce, we would either need a reproducible case or try out a new build that uses a different queue. For the second case, you could try to use [this library](<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/nf4lh1yh0uurtgf/libAPSAnalytics.zip?dl=1)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.dropbox.com/s/nf4lh1yh0uurtgf/libAPSAnalytics.zip?dl=1)</a> by replacing it in <code>~/Library/Application Support/Titanium/mobilesdk/osx/<sdk-version>/iphone/Classes/APSAnalytics</code>.</li>

   [~perdona] Any update on my feedback? We want to address possible APSAnalytics issues over the next weeks, so any constructive feedback would help.</li>

   Resolving due to inactivity. As this didn't rise up again, it looks like its not an issue anymore!</li>

   Was this ever resolved? This error and several variations of it are the top 5 crash causes of our app. We do use the Axway Analytics module as well.</li>
