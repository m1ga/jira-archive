<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Steps to Reproduce</h4>
I was running Titanium SDK 6.0.1.GA.  I decided to install the update 6.0.2.GA before packaging for the Android Store.  After the update and testing the app with the new SDK version, I decided to  package the app.  After getting prompted for the necessary properteis such as directory and  keystore properteis, and presented with an error saying Android SDK 4.4.2 was not found (See android_build_error1 attachment).  I hit OK and the packaging stops.  I have Android SDK 4.4.2 installed and it shows as installed when I go to the Install SDK page from preferences (see android_installed_sdk attachement) 

<h4>Actual Result</h4>
An error saying Android SDK 4.4.2 was not found is thrown, and teh packaging stops

<h4>Expected Result</h4>
The app would be package for dsitribution properly without any errors.

   Hello, I was able to get around this issue and successfully package the app for the Google Play store.  To resolve the issue I uninstall and reinstalled Android API 4.4.2.  After reading that a similar issue existed with Android Studio and that it might cache related, I decided to uninstall and reinstall the API. </li>
