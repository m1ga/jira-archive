<h3>Description</h3>

{quote}As a developer,
I want to be able to publish/execute the last successful build to my simulator/device without rebuilding,
So that I can more quickly test apps and features.{quote}

A lot of times, developers have multiple apps that they might be testing (with or without LiveView) and they want a way to quickly test or start an app without having to rebuild.   

I think having a command like "run" and an options like "--skip-build" would get us much closer to this.

   Sounds interesting! So we would just invoke the sim control command to launch the Simulator? [~cbarber], this could be a cool idea!</li>

   I'm not sure if it is more complicated when using LiveView.  Can it just restart the LiveView server when it invokes the sim control command?</li>

   We talked about doing this a long time ago. I liked the idea. Back then we were using <code>ios-sim</code> which had very limited functionality. Now that <code>ioslib</code> uses <code>simctl</code>, this should be possible.
   
   Sort of related, I had the idea of keeping the last successful build which we kind of do today. The only difference is we would place the built app in a sterile directory. Then we could decouple the build from install/run. Install/run would just grab the last successful build and give it a go.
   
   LiveView's architecture is going to dramatically change, so I'm not sure how it's going to work. Part of the problem is we instrument the app with a bunch of LiveView code, so we can't enable/disable LiveView without doing a build. Perhaps that's something we should fix too. I'd like to see LiveView baked into the platform code and not injected into the first line of <code>app.js</code>. But then again, I'd like LiveView to be more live and expose more runtime inspection.</li>
