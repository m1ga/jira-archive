					"body": "We talked about doing this a long time ago. I liked the idea. Back then we were using {{ios-sim}} which had very limited functionality. Now that {{ioslib}} uses {{simctl}}, this should be possible.\r\n\r\nSort of related, I had the idea of keeping the last successful build which we kind of do today. The only difference is we would place the built app in a sterile directory. Then we could decouple the build from install/run. Install/run would just grab the last successful build and give it a go.\r\n\r\nLiveView's architecture is going to dramatically change, so I'm not sure how it's going to work. Part of the problem is we instrument the app with a bunch of LiveView code, so we can't enable/disable LiveView without doing a build. Perhaps that's something we should fix too. I'd like to see LiveView baked into the platform code and not injected into the first line of {{app.js}}. But then again, I'd like LiveView to be more live and expose more runtime inspection.",
