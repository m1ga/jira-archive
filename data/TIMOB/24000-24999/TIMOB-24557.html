   We are using the official Xcode build command since Titanium SDK 6.0.2 and Xcode does not generate .ipa files for non-ad-hoc builds. This conforms with the way Xcode does it nowadays as well. See the attached image to show the build directories of Titanium compared to Xcode. 
   
   However, I see use-cases where you want to have .ipa builds (e.g. for manual deployment OTA). For those cases, you should build for ad-hoc and export the .ipa from there. That's also the way native Xcode developers do it. 
   
   Note: You can just drop the .app file into iTunes and export it back to the desktop. This will generate an ipa for you. Bonus note: An ipa is just an .app file that is zipped and renamed to .ipa.
