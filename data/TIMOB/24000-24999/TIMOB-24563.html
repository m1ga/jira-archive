<h3>Description</h3>

In the last version of the Command line, when doing an Adhoc build it is now forcing to choose an Ad Hoc UUID, when previously you could choose from App Store UUIDs as well.

appc run -p ios -T dist-adhoc -O ./dist

This change breaks the functionality for TiFastlane. Could it revert to allow to choose between Ad-Hoc or AppStore? Or is there another way to build an IPA for the AppStore, the current dist-appstore generates an archive, which doesn't allow integration with fastlane.

Thanks

   Talked to Hans, this is actually the correct behaviour. We can close it now :)</li>

   Thanks Uriel! Again for other potential visitors of this ticket: This was made to align with the native xcodebuild behavior that is also used in Xcode itself. We used an internal Xcode API before that have been removed in Xcode 8.3, so we changed it in 6.0.3.GA to do the same as Xcode. Thanks again!</li>
