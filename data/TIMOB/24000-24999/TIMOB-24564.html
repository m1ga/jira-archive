<h3>Description</h3>

I need to guarantee that GPS positions being provided are not spoofed in my app.

It would be fantastic if a simple boolean could be returned to say that location data was being mocked. 

I did a search around and this seems relatively simple to do; see [<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6880232/disable-check-for-mock-location-prevent-gps-spoofing" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6880232/disable-check-for-mock-location-prevent-gps-spoofing</a>]

Since API 18, the object Location has the method .isFromMockProvider() so you can filter out fake locations, but this is not exposed to us via the Appcelerator API
