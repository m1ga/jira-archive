   We need more infos on this ticket:
   - Example code
   - Some screens
   
   I don't see any API to manually disable this behavior.
   
   *EDIT*: Checked it: There is a) no API to configure this and b) it does not look like the file name is added to the subject (see attached image). Resolving as <code>Not our Bug</code> for now.</li>

   Hey [~hansknoechel] could you share the code you used?  the way they are implementing document viewer in their sample app, (Link to app is provide in ticket) they are consistently getting the subject in the file name.

   I just tried the given example as well, but using 6.0.3.GA and it works there. So things they need to check:
   * Try with SDK 6.0.3.GA and Xcode 8.3 (shouldn't make a difference, but just in case)
   * Check with iOS 10.3 and earlier (I used 10.3, it may have been a bug on iOS before)
   * Provide some screens or even a video of the given behavior</li>

   Right, so it's clearly a difference between the iOS versions I guess? And it looks like Apple fixed it, so just as I suspected above. We cannot influence this behavior, it was an Apple issue.</li>

   Closing as "not our bug". If you disagree, please reopen.</li>
