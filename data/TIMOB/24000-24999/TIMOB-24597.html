<h3>Description</h3>

Could we have a new property in Ti.UI.Picker as *popupBackgroundColor* as it's available in native Android at here [<a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/Spinner.html#attr_android:popupBackground" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/Spinner.html#attr_android:popupBackground</a>]?

Currently we can only set backgroundColor of Ti.UI.Picker in non-popup state, means initial state. But there are many times when an app's requirement is to set the background of picker in opened/popup state to match the app's theme.

   I'd like to see this too.  And it needs to work in "dialog" mode as well as "dropdown" mode.</li>
