<h3>Description</h3>

H5. Issue Description 

Using Ti.UI.View.removeAllChildren on a View element on Windows devices results in no children being removed. There is a viable workaround in iterating through each child of a View and removing it individually. However, trying to use removeAllChildren then using this workaround results in nothing happening (it is possible that removeAllChildren is somehow removing items from the View.children array without affecting the UI).

<h4>Steps to Reproduce</h4>

Here is a bare bones project that reproduces this issue: <a href="https://github.com/bbuehler-axway-support/windows-removeAllChildren" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/bbuehler-axway-support/windows-removeAllChildren</a>

To use this example app, add children to the view by clicking the "Add Child View" button. Clicking the "Remove All Children" button does nothing. Kill and relaunch the app. Add more child views. Clicking "Remove Each Child" button removes all children. Add more child views. Clicking the "Remove All Children" button still does nothing; without killing and relaunching the app, add more child views and remove them with "Remove Each Child". Child views added before clicking "Remove All Children" will remain while child views added afterward will be removed correctly.
