   Yes, Usually socket hang up is causing by network problem. 
   
   Here is some suggestion:
   
       Reboot the studio.
       Change to a better network, or reset your connection.
   
   Also, Try the below command in terminal/command prompt
   
    appc logout -D
    appc login
   
   If that's doesn't help, uninstall node, and reinstalled Node and CLI. Thanks.

   I tried the appc logout -D, uninstall node and reinstalled node and CLI.  Getting the same issue.
   
   I'm going to work with our Network team.  Can you provide me with Appcelerator IP addresses that your command utilities would be trying to get to?</li>

   Hello [~stentzk@cintas.com]
   Here are a couple of things that should help:
   
   If you are behind a proxy, you must set the proxy server. In some cases, you must also whitelist URLs. 
   
   Since you are using only the CLI from what I can tell, you can set the proxy server like so:
   <code>appc config set proxyServer http://yourProxyServerHere</code>
   
   If you need to whitelist, and can't whitelist *.appcelerator.com then you can refer to the list of URLs on <a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#</a>!/guide/Using_Studio_From_Behind_a_Proxy
   
   To find out exactly what is happening, and any calls to URLs that are occurring, you can set the log to trace output with something like <code>appc run -l trace</code></li>

   Closing as there was no response from reporter. Assuming proxy issues were addressed.</li>
