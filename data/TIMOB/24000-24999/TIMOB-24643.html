<h3>Description</h3>

I'm having challenges in registering Android device for push notifications. 
With all my trail and errors options, I found 
"<property name="acs-push-api-url-development" type="string"><a href="https://api.cloudapp-1.appctest.com/v1/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://api.cloudapp-1.appctest.com/v1/</a></property>" 
this property has to be added to the ti.xml file to get the device registered (if you are lucky). 
 
What I observed was 
1. If the mobile app is already installed in the device then even after adding this property and rebuilding and installing the app in the emulator didn't solve the problem. The existing app has to be uninstalled and then reinstalled after the property added to ti.xml file to register the android.  

2. If the app is installed with this property added, even after removing the property from the ti.xml file and reinstalling the app, the device still gets registered until the app is removed and reinstalled.

used this sample project
