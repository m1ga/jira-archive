<h3>Description</h3>

Updated to 6.0.4

Build iPad and iPhone project. App runs on simulator, but gives warning:

[WARN] :   error while updating tiapp data with appc platform: 

When I build as package and attempt to upload to iOS App Store, upload fails with error -22421. Building to 6.0.3 succeeds without warning and upload to App Store succeeds.

   Hi [~dethier1958], the only major changes that affect app store builds are the replacement of Xcode's PackageApplication tool (shipped in 6.0.2.GA) and proper support for enterprise provisioning profiles (shipped in 6.0.3.GA). I don't really see anything that changed in 6.0.4.GA that would affect app store builds.
   
   I recommend logging out of the Appc Platform and logging back in to fix the warning. Then clean your project and re-build and maybe that will fix your apps store issue.

   Thanks. Cleaning the project seems to have eliminated the warning. I assume that will also fix uploading to the App Store. Please close this issue.</li>
