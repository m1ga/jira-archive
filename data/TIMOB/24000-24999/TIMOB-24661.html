   Hey Brian, thanks! But wait a second, didn't we have this in TIMOB-24547 as well (where you commented). I commented as well that it's resolved in 2.1.0 (as part of TIMOB-20274), so you are still getting it with 2.1.0?</li>
<li>Brian García 2017-05-05

   Hi Hans, yes it still happens in 2.1.0 that's why I opened a new ticket I think it could be a different issue may be regarding the dynamic lib hook.</li>
<li>Hans Knöchel 2017-05-05

   Ok, so 
   * Is the issue is appearing when you use a native module together with Hyperloop? 
   * Do you use any Hyperloop functionality (because I cannot see any)? 
   * Will it work if you add one like a UILabel reference? 
   * Does it work with other modules that do not have the dynamic-lib hook?
   * Can you attach the whole error-trace-log?
   * (Unrelated, personal) Why not just use the framework with CocoaPods in Hyperloop?
   
   Thanks :-)</li>
<li>Brian García 2017-05-06

   Answering in order:
   
   * Yes, for me only happens with this module.
   * In other project yes, I made this demo project to see if there is any collision with some Hyperloop requires but it crashes just adding it to tiapp.xml
   * No, for the above reason.
   * Yes, I have other modules in the original projects and compiles and run perfectly.
   * the build log is inside the zip (if you need another one that there is in a different location just tell me the path I will upload it to a gist) I stated that there are some lines that doesn't show up in the build log: 
   <code><pre>
   [DEBUG] Copying /Users/Brian/Documents/workspace/chartPoC/Resources/iphone/app.js => /Users/Brian/Documents/workspace
   /chartPoC/build/iphone/build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/chartPoC.app/app.js
   [ERROR] An error occurred during build after 7s 374ms
   [ERROR] keys[num].indexOf is not a function
   </pre></code>
   
   * Because the mpcharts is a swift pod and pod frameworks are not supported yet. Also because I want to test if there is a performance difference between Hyperloop and native module (in Android I think so, but I need to do more testing)</li>

   [~hansknoechel], the crash is caused by the ti.dynamiclib hook. It extends the Array prototype by just assigned the <code>last</code> property. This causes all arrays to have the iterable property <code>last</code> which causes the crash. To avoid that, the prototype extension should be defined like this:
   <code><pre>
   if (!Array.prototype.last) {
     Object.defineProperty(Array.prototype, 'last', {
       value: function() {
         return this[this.length - 1];
       }
     });
   }
   </pre></code></li>

   Thanks Jan! Updated the library and released [1.0.1 on Github](<a href="https://github.com/appcelerator-modules/hook-embedded-frameworks/releases)." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator-modules/hook-embedded-frameworks/releases).</a> Resolving issue ...</li>
