<h3>Description</h3>

I am getting this error when I try const test = 5   (same thing happens with let)

[ERROR] The keyword 'const' is reserved


NOTE:  In trying to recreate this with new project, I am noticing that it only happens when Hyperloop is enabled.

See steps to recreate below.

   [~brentonhouse] Hey there! Thanks for the report, could you provide a little more information about the issue? 
   
   * Is the project a classic project or an alloy project
   * Could you copy the full error log when running your command with <code>-l trace</code>
   * Some other versions such as CLI version <code>appc -v -o json</code>
   
   Thanks!</li>

   Thanks [~eharris]
   
   It is an Alloy project.
   
   Steps to recreate.
   
   1. Create new project with CLI
   2. Select option to enable Hyperloop
   3. Change 'var' to 'const' in alloy.js
   4. Execute:  appc ti build --platform ios --target simulator --log-level trace
   
   {noformat}
    appc -v -o json
   {"NPM":"4.2.9","CLI":"6.2.1"}
   {noformat}
   
   I will attach the log file as well.
   
   
   Also as a separate issue, notice that the CLI did not accept my parameter of --log-level trace
   You can see in the log file that the parameter was there but the CLI still prompted me for log level.

   If it is of any help, the error seems to be coming from the <code>nodent</code> npm package.</li>
<li>Ewan Harris 2017-05-23

   [~brentonhouse] Thanks for the tips! Moving this over to TIMOB so apologies for any email spam you might receive :)</li>
<li>Hans Knöchel 2017-05-23

   Makes sense to include this in 2.1.1. I see your 2_1_X backport, so please also make a PR for master. [~jvennemann] wanna review? :-) [~cwilliams] may be a good additional reviewer.</li>
<li>Brenton House 2017-05-23

   I assume the issue with the --log-level flag is a separate issue and I should create a different ticket, correct?</li>
<li>Ewan Harris 2017-05-23

   Yes, the removal of the flag is separate to this issue. It's a known issue (CLI-1208), so no need to worry about filing a new ticket :)</li>
<li>Brenton House 2017-05-23

   Thanks [~eharris]!</li>
<li>Jan Vennemann 2017-05-23

   LGTM! 
   
   [~eharris] good idea to move to babylon for parsing, so we are in sync with node-titanium-sdk. I opened TIMOB-24721 for that, just FYI.</li>
<li>Abir Mukherjee 2017-05-26

    [~eharris] Is the review done on this one. Can it be merged? We're hoping to get 2.1.1 released Friday.</li>
<li>Ewan Harris 2017-05-26

    [~amukherjee] As far as I can tell yes the review is done. Shall I go ahead and merge or is that down to one of [~jvennemann] or [~cwilliams]?</li>
<li>Hans Knöchel 2017-05-26

    Just merged it, as both reviews passed.</li>

    Node Version: 6.10.1 
    NPM Version: 3.10.10 
    Mac OS: 10.12.4 
    Appc CLI: 6.2.2 
    Appc CLI NPM: 4.2.9 
    Titanium SDK version: 6.1.0.GA 
    Appcelerator Studio, build: 4.9.0.201705251638 
    Xcode 8.3.2 
    Hyperloop 2.1.1
    
    I followed the steps in the description using the above environment, and confirmed that the reserved keyword error is not seen.
