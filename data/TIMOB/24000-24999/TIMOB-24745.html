<h3>Description</h3>

We fixed Android CommonJS modules for 6.1.0 in TIMOB-24654. Unfortunately, a community member reported that he still cannot build CommonJS modules, when those contain multiple JS files inside the <code>assets/</code> directory. The test-case can be used from the above ticket, with an additional JS file that is placed in the directory.

   Thanks hans for opening this ticket. 
   [Here is](<a href="https://gist.github.com/AndreaVitale/32c06ad366202ee31c5e5419a5a6fbb1)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://gist.github.com/AndreaVitale/32c06ad366202ee31c5e5419a5a6fbb1)</a> the error log that I got when I try to with another file, different from <code>my.module.id.js</code> inside the <code>assets</code> folder. Removing it, the build process succeeds.
   I tried to build using CLI 6.2.0 and 6.2.2 and different version of NDK: from r10e to the latest.</li>

   [~hansknoechel] [~Andrea.Vitale] Do we have any details or test cases about whatever remaining issue we have here? It's not clear to me exactly what is wrong here. I guess the idea is that the build doesn't fail now with multiple js assets but that one or both somehow aren't returning their exports when required?</li>

   Hi Chris, I edited the <code>_buildModule.js</code> with the snippets reported in your [PR here](<a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/9117)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/9117)</a> and the problem is solved. I have no more problem at compile time and at runtime. 
   Now I have problems on iOS. 
   Should I to create a new ticket for this?
   
   I'm on Slack if you want to dm with me in a faster way.</li>

   Verified the fix in SDK 6.2.0.v20170608114043 & local 6.1.1 build.
   
   1. Built the <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator-modules/appcelerator.syncserver.client" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator-modules/appcelerator.syncserver.client</a> module which has multiple <code>.js</code> files in the <code>assets</code> folder.
   2. Module was built successfully.
   
   EDIT: Verified the fix with SDK 6.1.1.v20170609120621.
