<h3>Description</h3>

Please test Ti.App.fireEvent not working for webviews in scrollviews.
with sdk 6.1.1.v20170531135549

Scenario:
Multiple webviews in a parent scrollview.
Set with willHandleTouches:false

contains html with a hrefs with: 
onclick="Ti.App.fireEvent...

The parent controller has 
Ti.App.addEventListener(eventname,webCallback);

SDK:
  <sdk-version>6.1.1.v20170531135549</sdk-version>

*EDIT by [~hansknoechel]*: Changing the <code>Affected Version</code> to 6.1.0, since 6.1.1 is from the same branch and therefore it's easier to group it with other 6.1.0 related tickets.

   I've ran tests locally and it looks like it has to do with the __ti_injection not happening on my production app. But on the test app, __ti_injection works. So the fireEvents are working. Do you have any idea why __ti_injection would not be working in a production app?</li>

   Hi Hans, 
   
   Close this issue! Found the problem - local production code and not appc issue.
   
   Explanation...
   __ti_injection was not created, therefore Ti.App.fireEvent would work because the webview html was a html snippet and not a fully formed html with wrapping html and body tags. It looks like the injection only happens for full html and not just snippets.
   
   After wrapping the html snippet with <html><body> tags, the ti_injection is now showing up in Safari:Develop: web inspector in the production app.
   
   <code><pre>
   <script id='__ti_injection'>window.Titanium={};window.Ti=Titanium...
   </pre></code>

   As per Anthony Chung's comment in the ticket that problem is not from SDK side, closing the issue.</li>
