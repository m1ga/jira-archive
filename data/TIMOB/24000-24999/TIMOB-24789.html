<h3>Description</h3>

Thing is according to Microsoft's documentation ( <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt695328.aspx" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt695328.aspx</a> ) there's two ways of collecting profiling data: with or without the debugger. This guide we have now only covers the "without the debugger" piece, by using Visual Studio's Performance Profiler. 

Now customer request to support the other way: support using Visual Studio's  Debugger's Diagnostic Tools for our app.

   In order to use with VS diagnostic tools, I believe you will need to get your own build of Titanium SDK. We have [getting-starated document](<a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile_windows#getting-started)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile_windows#getting-started)</a> for preparing development environment, but I would say it's not recommended for almost all Titanium users because it's pretty advanced development topic there and should require pretty extensive knowledge about UWP app development with C++/CX and C#. I would resolve this as "won't do".</li>

   Customer can accept your device. But one more question:
   
   Maybe you can help us understanding what's the value of having (and following) this <a href="https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides2/Managing+Memory+and+Finding+Leaks#ManagingMemoryandFindingLeaks-MonitoringallocationsonWindows" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides2/Managing+Memory+and+Finding+Leaks#ManagingMemoryandFindingLeaks-MonitoringallocationsonWindows</a> if we can't see living in memory objects?</li>

   Even Visual Studio diagnostic tools isn't fully working, you can still take snapshot of application memory allocations by using "Take snapshot" button. I have [updated the document based on it](<a href="https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides2/Managing+Memory+and+Finding+Leaks#ManagingMemoryandFindingLeaks-MonitoringallocationsonWindows)." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides2/Managing+Memory+and+Finding+Leaks#ManagingMemoryandFindingLeaks-MonitoringallocationsonWindows).</a></li>
