					"body": "Hey there, here are the issues with the project: There is a static library that links to header files received from other sub-directories. Hyperloop will assume those as the framework-name right now, resulting in the above require-statements that fail. Also the \".bundle\" is placed in one of the sub-directories, but is not marked as a resource. It should just be copied to {{app/assets/iphone}} and will be picked up properly after that. The general issue here is that the discussed library (Aisle411) does not support a proper framework-structure (neither a .framework, nor a CocoaPods dependency), making the general usage - same for native and Titanium - pretty complicated. We discussed this internally in the Hyperloop team and actually considered to wrap everything to a proper framework that can be used, but for right now, the following should resolve the issues:\r\n1. Copy {{native/aisle411/res/MapSDKResources.bundle}} to {{app/assets/iphone/MapSDKResources.bundle}}\r\n2. Put all header files in one global \"MapBundle\" directory (see example [here|https://abload.de/img/bildschirmfoto2017-0742kik.png]), so it get's picked up correctly\r\n\r\nSide-note #1: You might think now \"Hyperloop could be smart enough to pick up those sub-directories for header files automatically\" and I am agreeing :-) It is already in review for 2.2.0 as part of the dynamic-framework support (see TIMOB-23570), so this won't cause any confusions in the future anymore. \r\n\r\nSide-note #2: If possible, the vendor of the library should be contacted to expose a properly packaged framework that can be used in modern architectures. I think it will not only help our customers but also any other developers using their solution as well. \r\n\r\nLet me know if there are any follow-up questions to be discussed, thanks everyone!",

					"body": "Hey there, I just resolved this issue. Here is how:\r\n* The library-name used in the appc.js was invalid, it should be {{MapSDK}}\r\n* Flattening the header-files (as discussed earlier) resolved the problem with the headers\r\n* The static library is no framework, so it should not be placed inside the {{header}} / {{source}} related directories\r\n* Instead, the static library is placed into {{platform/iphone}} and get's picked up the classic module builds do\r\n\r\nDoing that, I just received a successful build and was able to require the following snippet:\r\n{code:js}\r\nvar MapController = require('MapSDK/MapController');\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nI also just attached my demo-project [here|https://www.dropbox.com/s/2c5wbd43v5csia1/test_mapsdk.zip?dl=1] and am actively discussing this with [~brentonhouse] on Slack, so this should be unblocked now. Please note: This was no Hyperloop issue and there is no Hyperloop-related fix necessary. A big issue was the way the library was received, so it's really not an issue from the customer as well. If possible, the customer should push the library-vendors to properly distribute their framework, so other developers can adopt it more easily. Nevertheless, we should improve our docs on the static-library usage and this ticket confirms this. We will schedule a rewrite of all Hyperloop docs for August, including advanced docs for framework-usage (static and dynamic), static-libraries, Cocoapods, more general syntax-comparison between native <-> Hyperloop and all related fields for Hyperloop Android as well.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if there are additional steps to be helped with!",

					"body": "Quick (public) update for the people following here: I am in direct contact with Brenton to deal with the issue. It seems that it's not directly a Hyperloop issue but an issue with the architectures the \"Aisle411\" library is providing. After it was wrapped into a framework, it is missing the 64-bit simulator-architecture ({{x86_64}}), it only has {{armv7, arm64}}. For comparison: The Facebook SDK has {{i386 armv7 x86_64 arm64}} which basically includes 32/64 Bit Simulator as well - which is fundamental when you want to test your applications on the Simulator.\r\n\r\nThe other issue is that the other library ({{AisleNetworking}}) was built as a Swift framework, which needs dynamic library support. Happily, we support that since a while and it seems to work. Unfortunately, it will still crash when trying to use it in non-swift projects, so they are having issues there as well. It even does not work on a native Swift project I've made (Objc as well), because it was compiled with Swift 3.0.2, but all modern Xcode versions (8.1+) use Swift 3.1 and later.  \r\n\r\nLong story short: We provided some guidance on what is required to make it work in (any kind of) app and are currently awaiting feedback. Please feel free to contact me for further questions if this relates to you! ",

The native module now builds as well and my sample app runs without the initial startup crash. The repository is currently closed-source on my Github account, Brenton has access to it so he can test the module. We may open source the module (without the SDK's in it), so others can benefit from it as well. \r\n\r\nAnd one side-note: By supporting their library, I was also able to support Swift frameworks in native modules, which was a huge gap for a long time. The required build-hook can be put in any module project that uses Swift frameworks, I will try to put some more information about it together soon.\r\n\r\nThe next step is that Shockoe tests the module and provide feedback about the usage. I think we are at a good point!\r\n\r\n*EDIT*: There will also be no SDK update required to use all this. So once this issue is resolved, the fix-version will remain empty.

Aisle411 told us to try changing the venueId to 1100951, but we are still not seeing anything in callback for that venueId.\r\n \r\nNotes from aisle411 below:\r\n\r\nThe SDK links also contain the sample applications and header/java docs.  For iOS the networking SDK was compiled using swift 3.1 and requires XCode 8.3.x.  This means for the iOS app there are 2 frameworks and one bundle you'll need to import.  The networking SDK isn't required but was created so you didn't have to write the networking code that interacts with our APIs.\r\n\r\nThe sample apps were created so you could follow how we would create the Aisle411 portion of the Publix application.  You'll also want to make sure to import the libstdc++.6.0.9.tbd and libz.tbd frameworks into your project, as the Map SDK requires those libraries.\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is link to video they sent showing build on simulator:  https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3uHTmZ4t7tZRzltX0t1dHByR00/view\r\n\r\nHere's the updated iOS SDK with bitcode support\r\nhttps://drive.google.com/open?id=0B3uHTmZ4t7tZMmZNa3RaQUtkb0k\r\n\r\nHere's the updated iOS SDK with bitcode support and x86_64 support.\r\nhttps://drive.google.com/open?id=0B3uHTmZ4t7tZbEw2SUZranhycTA\r\n\r\nHere's the latest iOS documentation\r\nhttps://drive.google.com/open?id=0B3uHTmZ4t7tZSjFkZV9wZFVhQXc\r\n\r\nHere's the Android SDK\r\nhttps://drive.google.com/open?id=0B3uHTmZ4t7tZSGFjaTJGaVZSaEk\r\n\r\nHere's the latest Android documentation\r\nhttps://drive.google.com/open?id=0B3uHTmZ4t7tZOGRvNlRNM0ZBSkU\r\n\r\n",

Unfortunately that was not documented as well, so it took me a while to realize the context to the file. The simulator architecture looks fine now and we are working on fixing the sim-crash now. It's still because of the Swift-based {{AisleNetworking}} library. They said that it's a utility library to wrap the HTTP-calls - I think we would have a much easier life if we could just use Ti.Network.HTTPClient to do the request. If they can provide the docs for the API, that might also be helpful until the sim-crash is addressed as well (targeting tomorrow morning PST). ",

Brenton is currently implementing more features from the modules, which I aligned on the sample-app we received. \r\n\r\nAlso, [~jvennemann] will push a Titanium SDK-fix that makes the workaround obsolete. It never occurred before, since we simply didn't support Swift in native modules.  \r\n\r\nWe can still do a meeting, but I wouldn't know about what topics at this point :-).",
