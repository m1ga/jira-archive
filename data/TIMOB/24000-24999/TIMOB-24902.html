<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Description</h4>

Currently (to my knowledge) ti_win_yaml doesn't allow for us to specify when something was deprecated or implemented. So it appears that everything is being marked as 4.1.0 on docs.appcelerator.

For deprecated items I guess the simplest/easiest way would be to add a new C++ macro like TITANIUM_FUNCTION_DEPRECATED(foo, 6.1.0), this would fit in with the existing pattern.

Specifying when something was implemented might be a little more difficult, for the namespace (Ti.FileSystem) could we use an <code>\@since 6.1.0</code>, but for individual properties and functions I'm unsure

   [~kota] [~gmathews] I believe both of you have worked on ti_win_yaml at some point in time? Any input/thoughts you have as to how we could achieve this?</li>
