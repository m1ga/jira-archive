<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Description</h4>
When referencing a module in a Windows Titanium App whose include export files contain types from a third party library, the App fails to compile since the appropriate references are not added to the TitaniumWindows_Native project. 

These references are added to the App package project; they should also be added to the TitaniumWindows_Native project. 

Currently, we do have a workaround which is opening the solution in the User/.titanium/vsbuild folder and add those reference manually. At developing time, the time spent doing these manual steps do add up. 

<h4>other information</h4>
Customer tried it using SDK 6.2.0.v20170531081104 and was still unable to build and App directly from the CLI that references their module which contains references to types from 3rd party libraries. Those libraries are indeed included in the App's main executable project but not in the TitaniumWindows_Native one thus, causing the build error.

   Use of 3rd party Windows Runtime Component (winmd) libraries in modules should have been enabled as of TIMOB-24101, do you mean
   
   * Use of 3rd party Windows Runtime component (.winmd) failed, OR 
   * Use of C++ libraries such as DLL & headers (*.hpp) failed?
