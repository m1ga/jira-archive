<h3>Description</h3>

While investigating this issue: AC-5069 - we are also hitting a secondary bug / warning message as part of upgrading to 6.1.1.GA (to investigate if the issue is resolved in this version).

Please see the attached screenshots - but it appears that either the compatibility matrix or the <code>appc ti info</code> CLI information is incorrect.

Please can you confirm exactly which versions of the Android SDKs are compatible with the latest Titanium / Appc SDK, and why this error is being seen.

   Hello, There is no screenshot here. Please attach it. </li>
<li>Peter Lancaster 2017-07-11

   Screenshots attached - not sure where they went previously.</li>

   Hello, This is a warning message. But the Android API 24 and 25 do support in the SDK 6.1.1.GA. </li>
<li>Peter Lancaster 2017-07-12

   So this is an incorrect warning message? If these SDKs are supported - why are we seeing it?</li>

   Hello [~plancaster], The warnings in the ti info are automatic, and try to warn that we may or may not have been able to verify compatibility on the SDK (when the CLI senses an installed Android SDK beyond what we have tested, this will be shown).
   
   We currently have about 3 or 4 tickets that we need to fix before we can claim full support - meaning we are confident that you can target the SDK for builds and not worry about crashing. I've asked our doc writer to change the compatibility matrix to no longer claim support for API 24 (we don't have an option for use at your own risk) until we resolve the outstanding items. 
   
   This support should be in place for 6.2.0 SDK, which I hope to get released next month.</li>

   Hi Eric - just to double check - API 24 support should be in 6.2.0 (hopefully next month) - but won't be in 6.1.2 due before then?
   
   When will full support for API 25 be present in the SDK?
   
   (I ask - as we've reviewed the work generated to date, and we'd like to move to the latest build tools we can to be confident that any additional issues with Android 7.+ devices that we encounter are resolved / resolvable)</li>

   Closing as 6.2.0 released.</li>
