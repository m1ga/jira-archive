<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Description</h4>

When filing a PR for TIMOB-24683, the unit tests were failing on Jenkins, they passed fine locally. It looked like the script that gets the app identity name to launch the app when installed to device was failing to unzip and then copy the appxmanifest file to the directory which would then cause the wptool launch call to error out due to an invalid guid.

<h4>Steps to reproduce</h4>

I am clueless as to how to reproduce this. That said to test the change didn't break anything we need to test building and launching to Windows 10 devices and emulator

<h4>Actual</h4>

Script fails to obtain the guid

<h4>Expected</h4>

Script should be able to get the guid
