<h3>Description</h3>

We have a regular occurrence of unstable builds on Jenkins for the Windows repos, the main reason recently seems to be one of the Windows nodes having an app installed on an emulator which is preventing the Windows 10 x86 from building to it, and then errorring out when the job attempts to collect the test results

   [~eharris] Do you think we can close this for now as we have migrated mocha-suite and it's been working good so far?

   [~kiguchi] I'm not sure, I still see some random failures around that bms_resource error from time to time. I think maybe we close this and if we see some consistent failures around environmental issues file a new one?</li>

   Make sense, but I would re-use this ticket with different description. At least I will change the ticket title.</li>
