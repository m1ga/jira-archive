		"description": "There are around 500 skipped tests on Windows, the total number of tests is only around 1000 so half of them being skipped is not good and they almost definitely do not have ticket associated with them if they're skipped for bugs, I know I have skipped some of these in frustration when merging the suites.\r\n\r\nReview the attached skipped list and then run through the tests, reviewing what can be unskipped as it now works, filing tickets as needed.\r\n\r\nI don't think we'd be able to achieve a code coverage output so in my opinion we should have a mechanism where we require a percentage of tests to be run to allow us to measure this, while it's not a great metric it is something to aim for and stop the bulk skipping of tests",
