<h3>Description</h3>

This is the feature works fine on Android but not on iOS platform , 
our application is book reader. the notes and highlight feature is more important to us and to make notes and highlight we must have to select the text inside webview. On iOS Platform The properties disableContextMenu : true also disable the text selection as well.

   Hello, the docs clearly states that "Note that disabling the context menu will also disable the text selection on iOS." 
   
   Feel free to share the native guide on his this is handled on native iOS. Our engineers will consider it. Thanks.</li>
