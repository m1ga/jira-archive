<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Description</h4>

This is mainly for the test suites but it seems like something that might be seen as nice from a users standpoint too. (Although in reality on UWP a developer should not be tying features to a device family but using the detecting API contracts <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2015/09/15/dynamically-detecting-features-with-api-contracts-10-by-10/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2015/09/15/dynamically-detecting-features-with-api-contracts-10-by-10/</a>, which maybe we should also have an API for?)

Basically in the tests we have to skip some tests on a device family because they prompt, Geolocation primarily, currently this is skipped on emulator easily by checking the model but a device is harder to check. We could skip both in one go by doing a check like <code>Ti.App.Windows.deviceFamily() === 'Windows.Mobile'</code>

There is some demo code on how to do this here <a href="https://gist.github.com/wagonli/40d8a31bd0d6f0dd7a5d" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://gist.github.com/wagonli/40d8a31bd0d6f0dd7a5d</a>  but note that it looks the DeviceFamily prop isn't documented <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.system.profile.analyticsinfo" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.system.profile.analyticsinfo</a>


Personally I'm not sure whether this should be in core, maybe in a native module or HL module

   I wrote a small Hyperloop based module that provides this functionality <a href="https://github.com/ewanharris/ti.windows.utilities" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/ewanharris/ti.windows.utilities</a></li>

   Nice, but I would think we should leverage Hyperloop in this case like you do in your module. I tend to think that we want to leverage Hyperloop more whenever possible rather than adding new features in Titanium API.

   I think this has to be done with Hyperloop. I would think we want to leverage Hyperloop whenever it can rather than adding new feature in Titanium API.</li>
