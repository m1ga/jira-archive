<h3>Description</h3>

This was raised via Slack by [~jeffbonnes] yesterday. He has an [example project](<a href="https://github.com/jeffbonnes/appc-doc-provider-example)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/jeffbonnes/appc-doc-provider-example)</a> that worked in Titanium SDK 5.x and does not work with SDK 6.x anymore. Testing it is pretty time-consuming, since you need three app-id's (main app, file provider extension, document provider extension), three provisioning profiles, one app-group and everything linked together in the tiapp.xml. 

After all, the app builds successful and the extension is visible on iOS. When trying to open it in the system-app "Files" (iOS 11) / "iCloud Drive" (iOS 10), it would then just show a loader and throw the attached error message.

We should investigate what changes regarding extensions in SDK 6.0 and fix it in the 6.2.0 time-frame.

*EDIT*: There seems to be a general issue with Document Provider extensions on iOS 9 (see [here](<a href="http://feedback.textasticapp.com/topics/1723-error-document-picker-both-google-drive-and-working-copy/)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://feedback.textasticapp.com/topics/1723-error-document-picker-both-google-drive-and-working-copy/)</a>, and [here](<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45304385/the-document-picker-failed-to-launch))" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45304385/the-document-picker-failed-to-launch))</a>, but as Jeff said, it seems to be working with a native project.
