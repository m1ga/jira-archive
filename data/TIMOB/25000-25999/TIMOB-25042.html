<h3>Description</h3>

Due to a mistake we will now have to maintain different app ids for android and ios. It would be nice if you could indicate that in the tiapp file without having to manually edit the field every time.

Alternately, if you could somehow inject build steps by platform target, I could automate that. This could also be a useful feature in general.

   Hello, Can you clarify? You can add multiple platform to support in tiapp.xml, even after you create the project with one platform. So, you don't need multiple app id for different platform. Can you share your issue?</li>

   I know that but I actually DO need multiple app ids for each platform. 
   
   We accidentally used the default keystore to release on android, and want to change to a different keystore. This requires us to change the app id only for android while leaving it the same on ios.</li>

   Hello, You need to understand this has to be allowed by play store and native Android itself. IF this is possible through native android. Share with us the guide. Thanks.</li>

   I'm referring to having a different app id for android than i do for ios, not two ids on the same platform.</li>
<li>Joseph Austin 2017-07-20

   It would work like this: you build for ios, it uses one app id. You build for android, it uses a different one. That way I don't have to manually change the value of that field each time.</li>

   From what I understand you are allowed to change the app id of a released app in the play store, and 'orphan' the other. 
   
   We want to do this because we accidentally released with the default keystore appcelerator studio generated for us and are concerned that it won't work in the future.</li>

   I know it is an old topic but still might be useful for other people:
   
   Why not add a <code>platform="android|ios"</code> property to <code>&lt;id&gt;</code> like it is already available for modules? so you could use it like this:
   <code><pre>
   &lt;id&gt;com.app.default&lt;/id&gt;
   &lt;id platform="android"&gt;com.app.anrdoid.default&lt;/id&gt;
   </pre></code></li>
</ol>
