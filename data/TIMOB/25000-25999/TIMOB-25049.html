<h3>Description</h3>

I have a problem when I tried to create a tableview to show articles with a image that should be full-width and with a fixed height.
I want that the app put the image in full-width and keep the aspect ratio if the height is bigger that the selected height is should cut the image. In iOS is works well but on android the exactly same code produce a different result.

To reproduce the issue you can create a default alloy project and past this code:
<a href="https://pastebin.com/Aef8yihy" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://pastebin.com/Aef8yihy</a> -> index.xml
<a href="https://pastebin.com/e7R4Gmqt" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://pastebin.com/e7R4Gmqt</a> - index.tss

In attachment I put an image with the different results achieved with the same code on iOS and on Android.

   Hello, I can reproduce the issue for iOS and Android different behavior. Although, Making Image height to "Ti.UI.FILL" in index.tss, will make the image covering the full width (The full image shows in the row, covering the full width and height. ) of the row but not the height cut as in iOS. Thanks.</li>
