<h3>Description</h3>

The current Android Support Library replacement requires the user to manually copy every support library file into an app or module. Since Revision 25.4.0 the Support Libraries no longer will be downloaded by Android Studio and are only available on a Google Maven repo.

To improve the user experience with this feature we need to allow a user to set the desired Android Support Library Revision he wants to use, download the .aar files and integrate them into the project. This should be configurable on a per project base, both for modules and apps.

Requirements:
* Select Android Support Library Revision to use via property in timodule.xml and tiapp.xml
* The build will download the selected revision from the Google Maven repo and integrate them into the project. This needs be cached on subsequent builds and should only trigger a re-download if the selected version changes. If the property gets removed, the build should automatically clean up the downloaded files
* Extends the AAR hook so it knows about the downloaded Android Support Library and can do the necessary transformation
* Update documentation on how the Support Library override works and mention that target SDK version major version of Support Library revision matches
