<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Issue Description </h4>
We've been working with buttons a lot and have noticed sometimes a black border will render around the button, even when there's NO border properties declared in the tss (no borderWidth, no borderColor), unfortunately, it's a random issue and we haven't been able to reproduce it reliably. 

Here's a sample app with only 1 button on it: <a href="https://propelics.box.com/s/g80r235tbipgadu1lj3yl5itvq5pd76i" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://propelics.box.com/s/g80r235tbipgadu1lj3yl5itvq5pd76i</a>

We can't really provide you with a set of steps, but advise you with running the app at least 10 times (yeah, awful). When doing this, you should be able to see the border appearing some times and other times not. We did several iterations like this (running the app 10 times in a row) and we were able to see the border appearing and disappearing at least 2 times per iteration. But we weren't able to identify a pattern.

Also, please notice that when the border appears, and the button gets clicked, the border goes away.

* This can be tested by deploying with -T ws-local

   I was not able to reproduce this, but I remember we are pushing to introduce new way of styling UI components by XAML directly (TIMOB-24984). I hope this results better rendering on this.</li>
<li>Kota Iguchi 2017-08-31

   [~rramirez] As of 6.2.0, we introduced new XAML styling capability with Titanium UI components (TIMOB-24984). Could you give it a try and see if this rendering issue is fixed or not? (See [XAML example here](<a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile_windows/pull/1066)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile_windows/pull/1066)</a> for details)
   
   It's already available on our nightly build:
   
   <code><pre>
   appc ti sdk install --branch 6_2_X 6.2.0.v20170830125819
   </pre></code>

   I was not able to reproduce this, but I would think this is not our bug because we do not implement any special rendering for Button border such as custom rendering or something.</li>

   Customer response 
   
   Well, we're testing in a ws-local app, in a development computer, and yes, it's been tested in three different computers by now.
   
   Are you running the app several times in a row? Say... 8, 10.</li>
<li> Ricardo Ramirez 2017-10-25

   [~kiguchi] any update here ?
   </li>
<li>Kota Iguchi 2017-10-26

   [~rramirez] I was running it like 20 times but I still can not reproduce this. How about leveraging Hyperloop Button for a workaround? It works quite similar to Titanium Button like below.

   [~rramirez] I created an app with a single button and set the properties as you have above, but I was not able to reproduce it. I tried to get the app from the Box link you provided, but I get an error saying that the "shared file has been removed or is unavailable to you". Would you be able to email the sample app that was in the link?</li>

   Does customer still have this issue? Do we have sample apps or screen recordings that reproduces the issue? I have one customer app (provided by TIMOB-25639) but I haven't see this issue either.</li>
<li>Kota Iguchi 2018-02-28

    I would resolve this as "Cannot Reproduce" for now because no one in the team can reproduce it. Is this still the issue? It is greatly appreciated if there's reproducible sample code for this.</li>
