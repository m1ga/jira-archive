<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Description </h4>
Customer has both public and enterprise account. Since switching to SDK 6.1.1 GA, from 5.5.1 GA, he is experiencing issues selecting the appropriate Distribution Certificate from the dropdown list. Studio defaults to Public account and not Enterprise. Even after changing to the correct Distribution certificate, the other dropdown "Select Provisioning Profile" is not updated to reflect the apps associated with that account. Because that dropdown will not update, then I cannot select the correct app and I cannot package the app.

<h4>Expected out come: </h4>
Being able to select appropriate Distribution certificate and Provisioning profile

<h4>Additional information: </h4>
User was able to get the provisioning profile drop down to update after switching back and forth between Distribution certificates.
