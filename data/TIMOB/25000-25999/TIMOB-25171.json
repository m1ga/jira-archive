		"description": "Triggered by a [blog post|http://skypanther.com/2015/10/arggh-failed-android-install/] by [~skypanther] I was thinking maybe we should ask the user to try again when for some reason the CLI failed to install an app on a device.\r\n\r\nCurrently, you'd need to do the full build again or manually figure out how to use the involved to tooling directly to install the existing build - which would not get you the logs via the CLI.\r\n\r\nWe could do something like:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n[INFO]  Making sure the adb server is running\r\n[INFO]  Installing apk: /path/to/your_app/build/android/bin/YourApp.apk\r\n[INFO]  Installing app on device: Galaxy Nexus\r\n[ERROR] Failed to install apk on \"01498FE710016018\"\r\n[ERROR] Error: INSTALL_FAILED_VERSION_DOWNGRADE\r\n\r\nWould you like to have me try it again?\r\n\r\n0) No, thanks\r\n1) Try again with device A (selected)\r\n2) Try again with device B\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nBy displaying and refreshing the (otherwise cached) list of connected devices the user would be able to try another device, the same or give up.\r\n\r\n*UPDATE:* As [~timpoulsen] suggested, it might be even better to have a map of errors-codes to human-readable reasons why the install failed as well as a flag if a retry would make sense. Like in the above example, it would not and the users will simply have to remove the app or bump the version and rebuild.",

By that I mean simply parsing the error code (e.g. INSTALLED_FAILED_VERSION_DOWNGRADE) and offering a helpful suggestion (\"Looks like you already have a newer version of this app installed on your device.\").
