   Is it possible that running 'appc info -t ios' works because you ran it after 'appc ti info' and it just took a moment to work? </li>

   I would then expect subsequent <code>appc ti info</code> commands to work (especially after the <code>appc ti info -t ios</code>, but they do not.</li>

   There could be a number of physical reasons (lock screen, etc..) for not displaying however, we are unable to reproduce with a iPhone connected to system. </li>
