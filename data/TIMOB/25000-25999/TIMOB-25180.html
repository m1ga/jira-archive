<h3>Description</h3>

When building for iOS (on simulator or device), on a Mac running a <code>Case-sensitive</code> journalling file format, Ti SDK 6.1.2.GA will fail to compile 100% of the time.

An example error can be seen below:

<code><pre>
[ERROR]         CompileC build/Intermediates/APPNAME.build/Debug-iphonesimulator/APPNAME.build/Objects-normal/i386/WatchSessionModule.o Classes/WatchSessionModule.m normal i386 objective-c com.apple.compilers.llvm.clang.1_0.compiler
</pre></code>

After losing almost an entire morning to this issue (*which _completely_ blocked one developer*), we have now got to the bottom of the issue, based on the solution [in this StackOverflow article](<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32797138/xcode-7-error-on-appcelerator-appc-5-0-2-titanium-sdk-5-0-0-ga-or-5-0-1-ga-or-3)." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32797138/xcode-7-error-on-appcelerator-appc-5-0-2-titanium-sdk-5-0-0-ga-or-5-0-1-ga-or-3).</a>

For clarity, within the *<Ti SDK Path>/iPhone/Classes* folder, the *WatchSessionModule.h* file needs to be changed as follows:

<code><pre>
#from this
#import &lt;WatchConnectivity/watchConnectivity.h&gt;

#to this
#import &lt;WatchConnectivity/WatchConnectivity.h&gt;
</pre></code>

Without this change, a developer using a file format like this is completely unable to build with the latest Titanium SDKs for iOS.

   Hey Peter,
   
   thank you for raising this! I am sorry one of your developers has been blocked because of this. If something related ever happens again, feel free to always reach out to our Slack community for some quick troubleshooting - our engineering team is also looking for issues there, so you will have good chances to receive feedback much quicker. You can also reach out to me directly (Username: hans) and we will figure something out. Also, it is always good to file a JIRA ticket first, our team is scanning JIRA for new issues many times a day. Hopefully that helps you for the next time!
   
   Regarding your issue, I just pushed the fix for master (7.0.0) and 6_2_X (6.2.0). If you want a custom 6.1.2 that also includes the fix, please let me know! I will wait to push the PR to ensure this is not happening in any other places as well. 
   
   Sorry again for the inconvenience caused by this!</li>
</ol>
