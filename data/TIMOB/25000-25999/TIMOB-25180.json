					"body": "Hey Peter,\r\n\r\nthank you for raising this! I am sorry one of your developers has been blocked because of this. If something related ever happens again, feel free to always reach out to our Slack community for some quick troubleshooting - our engineering team is also looking for issues there, so you will have good chances to receive feedback much quicker. You can also reach out to me directly (Username: hans) and we will figure something out. Also, it is always good to file a JIRA ticket first, our team is scanning JIRA for new issues many times a day. Hopefully that helps you for the next time!\r\n\r\nRegarding your issue, I just pushed the fix for master (7.0.0) and 6_2_X (6.2.0). If you want a custom 6.1.2 that also includes the fix, please let me know! I will wait to push the PR to ensure this is not happening in any other places as well. \r\n\r\nSorry again for the inconvenience caused by this!",
