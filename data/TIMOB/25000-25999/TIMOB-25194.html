<h3>Description</h3>

When trying to build an Android app using Appc Studio, Studio is always trying to open a new emulator, even if the emulator is already open. In some cases the emulator will open and successfully install, run the application - but this also fails a majority of the time seemingly related to a timeout issue.

This is happening using both genymotion and Android emulators.

I'll try and gather more information from the user.

   [~cng]  There are 2 issues here:
   1. Timeout during app launch/emulator launch 
   2. Opening a new emulator for every build
   
   *Timeout during build:*
   This is happening both in windows and mac os platforms.
   And this is not consistent - I tried 5 times, only once it was able to launch the emulator and installed the app.
   
   Below are the various errors which I encountered during the build, but most of the time it was timeout.
   
   <code><pre>
   [INFO] :   Waiting for emulator to become ready...
   [ERROR] :  Emulator failed to start in a timely manner
   The current timeout is set to 120000 ms
   You can increase this timeout by running: titanium.js config android.emulatorStartTimeout <timeout ms>
   </pre></code>
   
   
   <code><pre>
   [INFO] :   Emulator ready!
   [INFO] :   Installing apk: /Users/kondalkolipaka/development/workspaces/runtime-Titanium-360/productionapp/build/android/bin/productionapp.apk
   [ERROR] :  Application failed to install
   The current timeout is set to 240000 ms
   You can increase this timeout by running: titanium.js config android.appInstallTimeout <timeout ms>
   </pre></code>
   
   
   <code><pre>
   [INFO] :   Making sure the adb server is running
   [INFO] :   Installing apk: /Users/kondalkolipaka/development/workspaces/runtime-Titanium-360/productionapp/build/android/bin/productionapp.apk
   [ERROR] :  Failed to install apk on "emulator-5554"
   [ERROR] :  Error: INSTALL_FAILED_INVALID_URI
   </pre></code>
   
   *Android emulator issue:*
   In windows os, for every build new android emulator is getting launched. I could see, for every build it's assigning a new port and launching a new emulator. The interesting thing here is, even though it started a new emulator but app is getting launched in the old emulator!
   In mac os, I don't see this issue, same emulator is getting used for everybuild.
   
   
   <code><pre>
    Running: C:\android-sdk-win\tools\emulator.exe "-avd" "testNexus5" "-port" "5558" "-no-boot-anim" "-partition-size" "128"
   </pre></code>
