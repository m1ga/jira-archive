<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Description</h4>

This epic is to track the different aspects of removing Windows Phone 8.1 and Windows 8.1 from Titanium SDK and any related tooling libraries.

At a pretty high level, not in a specific order:

* Stop producing and testing in CI the relevant build artifacts
* Remove platform specific code from within the Titanium Windows source files
* Update documentation
* Remove support from various scripts around building the SDK and stuff
* Spit out a warning? (Probably needs to be slid in before 7, maybe in 6.3.0 or 6.4.0)
* After this is done, close any outstanding tickets as wont fix
* Before doing this, identify if there are any high profile tickets we wish to fix before dropping
* Have Studio remove the  different 8.1 related views (packaging dialog with the SDK choice, not sure on others). Will file the ticket once this is all approved

This *has to be done* for the 7.0.0 timeframe, keeping 8.1 around for another year (we plan 1 major rev a year as I understand) would be a bad choice that would severely limit our ability to move things forward and keep progressing the Windows Platform at the same rate as iOS and Android. I don't believe our current deprecation policy reserves our right to remove a platform at any time like the currently proposed update.

   [~emerriman] Could you provide some advice here? Personally I would consider this epic done, but we haven't completed subtask 2 (remove platform specific code), do we have to keep this open til that is closed?</li>
