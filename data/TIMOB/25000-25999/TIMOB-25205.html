<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Description</h4>

This sub-task is to track removal of platform specific code and macros. It's probably best to split this into individual tasks for each grouping of modules Filesystem, Global etc. (everything under [here](<a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile_windows/tree/f335f2ba034ba707d349cb2e91f6e7738b98888b/Source)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile_windows/tree/f335f2ba034ba707d349cb2e91f6e7738b98888b/Source)</a> to avoid a unreviewable PR

   I think this does not have to be so high priority and is not mandatory (blocker) for TIMOB-25202 because we can leave the code as it is and nothing should go wrong then because C/C++ macros just ignore the old codes. I agree that we should remove the old codes eventually in the future release.</li>

   Just in case I missed something, [~eharris] when you say "remove platform specific code" it means removing "Windows Phone 8.1/Windows 8.1 specific code", right?</li>
<li>Ewan Harris 2017-08-30

   [~kiguchi] Yeah you're correct, I think I had typed <code>Windows Phone 8.1/Windows 8.1</code> that much that I gave up here and just used platform specific :) 
   
   I agree that it's not really a super high priority item, more of a cleanup task to help keep the code clean. I think it would be good to group together (by namespace or some other grouping) in case we ever need to revert.</li>
