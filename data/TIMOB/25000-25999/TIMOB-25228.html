<h3>Description</h3>

It used to be in previous versions of the SDK, certainly pre-Hyperloop that if you tried to show a second Popover it would automatically close the original one. Now it crashes the whole app everytime!

I've already re-written my app with a PopoverManager that keeps a pointer to the Popover and if it exists, hides it, nulls it then 200ms later will spawn a new one, otherwise it will just spawn a new one.

So the work around is easy enough, but I had to do quite a bit of re-writing for this.

Attached is a small example that re-creates the issue. 

Click 1 then 2 = Crash
Click 3 then 4 as many times as you want = No Crash

   Thank you for reporting this issue! While we are trying to reproduce this issue, I am still not sure how Hyperloop plays into this crash, as you are not using it anywhere in the code. Hyperloop was released in 5.5.0 and lives independently from the Ti.* methods. I will get back to you once I found out what's causing the issue.</li>

   I was really thinking it would be the <code>run-on-main-thread</code> property blocking it, but it isn't (it's smart enough to not block the UI), so it's happening with both kroll- and main-thread. I am wondering when the last time it worked was. Investigating for the next iOS release (6.2.0 will be released this week already, 6.3.0 is iOS 11-only, so 6.4.0 will be the candidate). But as we will likely fix it earlier, hopefully this week, you can already patch your 6.1.x SDK early. I hope that helps you!</li>
