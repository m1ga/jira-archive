Now it crashes the whole app everytime!\r\n\r\nI've already re-written my app with a PopoverManager that keeps a pointer to the Popover and if it exists, hides it, nulls it then 200ms later will spawn a new one, otherwise it will just spawn a new one.\r\n\r\nSo the work around is easy enough, but I had to do quite a bit of re-writing for this.\r\n\r\nAttached is a small example that re-creates the issue. \r\n\r\nClick 1 then 2 = Crash\r\nClick 3 then 4 as many times as you want = No Crash\r\n\r\n",

I am wondering when the last time it worked was. Investigating for the next iOS release (6.2.0 will be released this week already, 6.3.0 is iOS 11-only, so 6.4.0 will be the candidate). But as we will likely fix it earlier, hopefully this week, you can already patch your 6.1.x SDK early. I hope that helps you!",
