<h3>Description</h3>

In 6.2.0 we introduce the automatic integration of frameworks from modules and from the apps <code>platform/ios</code> folder. To further ease the use of frameworks, the build should also be able to automatically integrate any resource bundles from frameworks with the Xcode project. This will remove the need to manually copy them to a module's <code>Resources</code> directory.

   [~jvennemann] Is that something we can do for 7.0.0? And how does Hyperloop do that currently? Remember my message today about the Intercom SDK, that may have been something related. Technically, we "just" need to reference them via our beloved pbx-file.</li>

   Hyperloop also does not support resource bundles as of now. But this is totally something we can easily implement in the framework hook. The only question is if there needs to be any control over which bundle should be integrated? Took a quick look at the Intercom SDK and there is no mention about the bundles in their manual installation guide. Also tested with CocoaPods and they just seem to copy them over to the app dir.</li>

   Yep, bundles usually are not handled anything special, they are just copied to the product by linking it as a resource in the pbx. If we do this, it should be done for both Hyperloop and classic modules.</li>

   Due to the schedule for 7.0.0 versus the remaining work, moving to 7.1.0</li>
