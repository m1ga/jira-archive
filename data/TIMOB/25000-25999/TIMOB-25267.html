<h3>Description</h3>

This ticket can be used to collect items that should be addressed to properly support the new iPhone X capabilities. Some changes we should to take care of before the iPhone X ships in November:

*Different screen-size*: 
 Add small change to iOS-build to add the new launch-screen to the asset-catalog. Please note that this also applies for custom splash-screens. Everyone using storyboards (the recommended way be Apple these days that we also support) will not have to change anything. 

*New App-Icon*: 
 -Apple might introduce a new icon-size for the iPhone X.- EDIT: No new icon-size! Will probably reuse the one from the iPhone 7S Plus dimensions (@3x)

*Face ID support*: 
As discussed on Teams, we may want to create a new module like "Ti.Identity" to manage all security-related functionalities in one module, including touch-id, face-id and keychain-access. This will also deprecate Ti.TouchID and move Android over as well.

*Validate layout*: 
As the layout changed to be bezier-shaped, we need to do smoke-tests regarding all layouts, especially top/bottom related ones. Also, there are safe-area properties we should investigate - either as a property or handle internally
There also seems to be a small UI-glitch when opening a window from a navigation-window and then closing the old window again. Not sure if it's a general Simulator issue or within Titanium apps, yet.

   extendSafeArea: false in a NavigationController and navBarHidden: true does not work right for me. The safe area at the top is not respected, the bottom safe area is. Only happens with navBarHidden on the window. Can anyone confirm this?
   
   <code><pre>
   var win = Titanium.UI.createWindow({
       backgroundColor: 'red',
       title: 'Red Window',
       extendSafeArea:false,
       navBarHidden: true,
   });
   win.add(Ti.UI.createLabel({text: 'Hello from Top', top: 0}));
   win.add(Ti.UI.createLabel({text: 'Hello from Bottom', bottom: 0}));
   
   var nav = Titanium.UI.iOS.createNavigationWindow({
      window: win
   });
   
   nav.open();
   </pre></code>

   I've got a similar issue.  When tabBarHidden: true the bottom safe area is accounted for.  The top is fine.</li>

   Let us check that, thanks! *EDIT*: Resolving the epic, since the support was added in 6.3.0. We'll create an own ticket for the above case.</li>
