<h3>Description</h3>

As discussed on Teams, we may want to create a new module like "Ti.Identity" to manage all security-related functionalities in one module, including touch-id, face-id and keychain-access. This will also deprecate Ti.TouchID and move Android over as well.

   Ok, here we go: I've created a new module "Ti.Identity" and moved everything over from "Ti.TouchID". We would also need to deprecate Ti.TouchID now (e.g. a warning in the TouchId.yml file). Then we would need [~bimmel] to update his build scripts to add the following repo to his module repo list:
   
   <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator-modules/titanium-identity" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator-modules/titanium-identity</a>
   
   The module also represents the Face ID relevant changes:
   * New constants to see which biometrics are supported
   * New error-codes to handle Face ID errors
   
   Rather than that, Face ID will work together with Touch ID as the "biometrics" option, so technically we already support it with the current Ti.TouchID. But to keep it more generic for the future and semantic naming, this should be the right step to go.</li>

   [~hknoechel] I have reviewed the code of module. It looks good to me. There is one minor doc update required, which I had send you in chat. Once that change is done, my review for module is complete. </li>
