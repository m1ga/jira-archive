<h3>Description</h3>

As the layout changed to be bezier-shaped, we need to do smoke-tests regarding all layouts, especially top/bottom related ones. Also, there are safe-area properties we should investigate - either as a property or handle internally
There also seems to be a small UI-glitch when opening a window from a navigation-window and then closing the old window again. Not sure if it's a general Simulator issue or within Titanium apps, yet.
