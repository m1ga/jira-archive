   This ticket does not have enough info to investigate the issue. Please add at least:
   * Full trace log
   * Used SDK version (does it work with 6.1.2?)
   * Does it work with native Xcode?
   * Does it only happen with iOS 11 builds or iOS builds in general?
   
   As the "Apps" section got removed, it might be the case that Apple removed the possibility to add them to iTunes directly. Will investigate for 6.3.0 for now.</li>

   Looking at a few sources today, it seems like Apple killed the iOS-App Store from iTunes completely, including the "Apps" tap and the integration of any app-related tasks (like listing apps from Xcode / Titanium in it):

   Device-builds should still be possible directly to the device or using the resulting ".app" file that can be installed to the device using the iPhone Configuration Utility. This is how it's done in Xcode and the same should apply for Titanium. Resolving as <code>Not Our Bug</code> for now.</li>

   Hello,
   I am facing same issues in it. But I found the way to make it possible not with iTunes.
   
   Steps to follow 
   
   Step 1: Run application with iTunes Sync.
   Step 2: After build completion Create a Directory in your Mac with name as "*Payload*" (Any where in mac).
   Step 3: Now navigation to"Debug-iphoneos" directory of your project.
               In my case "/Users/[username]/Documents/Appcelerator_Studio_Workspace/[projectname]/build/iphone/build/Products/Debug-iphoneos".
   Step 4: Now copy .*app* file and paste it in to the "*Payload*" directory which you created. 
   Step 5: Now right click on "*Payload*" directory and select "Compress Payload".
   Step 6: Rename the *Payload.zip* which you compressed with your ProjectName.ipa (Please change file extension to ipa instead of .zip. Also you can set file name as you want).
   Step 7: After competing all above step you have .ipa file which can be used to transfer. 
   
   That's it.

   That's correct! Here is a shell-script to do the same (save it as <code>build-ios-ipa.sh</code> and call it with <code>sh build-ios-ipa-sh &lt;AppName&gt;</code>:
   <code><pre>
   #!/bin/bash
   appc run -p ios -T device
   cd build/iphone/build/Products/Debug-iphoneos
   mkdir Payload
   mv KitchenSink.app "Payload/$1.app"
   zip -r "$1.ipa" Payload/
   rm -rf Payload/
   open .
   </pre></code>
   Please also follow TIMOB-25321 as we're planning to replace the "iTunes Sync" option with something like "Export .ipa".</li>

   Great, thanks.</li>
<li>Raymond Verbruggen 2018-02-19

   This works great, thanks!
   
   Modified the script a little bit so it works with other apps than kitchensink :)
   
   
   <code><pre>
   #!/bin/bash
   appc run -p ios -T device
   cd build/iphone/build/Products/Debug-iphoneos
   mkdir Payload
   mv "$1.app" "Payload/$1.app"
   echo "creating .ipa file"
   zip -r -q "$1.ipa" Payload/
   rm -rf Payload/
   open .
   
   </pre></code>
