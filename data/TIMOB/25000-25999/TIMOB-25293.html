<h3>Description</h3>

H5. Issue Description 

In our application we are using finger print based authentication for Android, and we are using TouchId module version 2.2.0.
When we keep the app in background, the app is still waiting for finger print to be supplied. If you supply finger print our app is getting focused even if we are using any other app at that time.

it would be helpful, if Touch Id module is returning a message when app is pushed to background.

<h4>Steps to Reproduce</h4>

To reproduce the issue,
1  Run the attached sample app here <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwTWo-c2a0b9OVhlWEdvc0Q2SEU" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwTWo-c2a0b9OVhlWEdvc0Q2SEU</a>
2  click on “click to get touchID view” label
3  Keep the app in background by pressing Home
4  Now provide the invalid/valid finger print, app will get focused.

   [~emerriman] do you have any update ? </li>

   [~rramirez] This isn't an issue with ti.touchid, the sample app provided creates a new window when a fingerprint is authenticated. That window will be brought into the foreground. I'm not sure what their expected behavior should be?
   
   You can use the <code>blur</code> event to detect if the window has entered a paused state.
   
   <code><pre>
   var win = Ti.UI.createWindow(),
       isBackground = false;
   
   win.addEventListener('focus', function(e) {
       isBackground = false;
   });
   win.addEventListener('blur', function(e) {
       isBackground = true;
   });
   
   win.open();
   </pre></code></li>
</ol>
