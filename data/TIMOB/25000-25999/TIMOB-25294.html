   I have been spending time trying to deal with this but ended up finding out there's no easy way to do this. I would think to resolve this as "Won't Do" because platform component API doesn't provide a way to do this. I also worried that changing date order for the Picker breaks Windows date picker UI look and feel and thus I'm not sure if it passes Windows Store certification. I'm guessing that the string formats for each date/month/year component can be changed based on user's locale setting and we should follow the UI spec in this case.</li>

   Closing as "won't do". If this is in error, please reopen.</li>
