<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Issue Description </h4>

So we have this 3rd party SDK that allows our app to do Live Streaming videos. We've successfully integrated it on iOS, and we're looking forward to integrate it with Android as well. One of the requirements that the SDK has for working is that it needs an instance of Surface View - to display a camera preview from where to broadcast the stream signal. On iOS it only needed an instance of UIView, which was accomplished by passing on a TiUIProxyView object to an iOS Titanium Module, that could be casted to UIView. However we couldn't find a way to do so on Android - seems like TiUIProxyView cannot be casted to Surface View object. So the question is: can titanium handle / create Surface Views for Android and pass them to an Android Titanium Module somehow ?

   To retrieve the native component of a <code>TiViewProxy</code> you can do the following:
   
   <code><pre>
   TiViewProxy.peekView() // returns TiUIView
   TiUIView.getNativeView() // returns View
   </pre></code></li>
