<h3>Description</h3>

Latest iTunes removed the ability to manage apps in it. Either we find way to export it to the iPhone  Configuration Utility (would be pretty cool), or remove the log completely. We should look out how others may do this. It is important because people usually sent .ipa files to their clients, which are also not created since Xcode 8.x anymore (another change by Apple). 

Maybe we can zip and rename it manually for them and show it in Finder? That'd be pretty cool for most of the use-cases!

Update: Looks like dragging iOS apps into the "iPhone Configuration Utility" app actually works, so that might be a smart alternative.

   So basically, we just need to rip out the old "iTunes Sync" option?</li>
<li>Hans Knöchel 2017-09-19

   We should replace it - either with "Show in Finder" or "iPhone Configuration Utility Sync". The first one would probably be more simple, but would require the .app to to bundles as an .ipa file, the second option would require changes in the apple-script we currently use to open iTunes.</li>

   Replace it? I fail to see how that is beneficial. If you can no longer install an .ipa via iTunes, then what's the point of creating the .ipa? And for the "iPhone Configuration Utility Sync" tool, I don't think it exists any more. After 30 seconds of Googling, I can't find a download link.
   
   iTunes Sync is going away. It had a good run.</li>

   People use it to generate IPA-files to send to clients. I just feel that if we simply remove it here, we get 10 new tickets the next year to find an alternative. But fine with removing for now then ..</li>

   If my memory serves me right, I believe [~cwilliams] and I discussed removing "iTunes Sync" as a "simulator" and adding it as a "device". I believe this was more for Studio's sake. Maybe we should introduce a new target "dist-ipa" or something?</li>
<li>Hans Knöchel 2017-09-20

   Or just propagate to use dist-adhoc if they want to share any IPA. That's how Xcode actually does it - you cannot just export an iPA for device builds. So it may be reasonable to remove the option and write a quick note so everyone knows. Or we go your direction and Add the "Export IPA" option to Studio / CLI that will generate an IPA file, but with a development certificate (since Adhoc will require a distribution one).
   
   CLI:
   - New argument "device-ipa"
   
   Studio: 
   - New option "Export .ipa"
   - Calls the new "device-ipa" CLI-argument
   
   Notice the "device-ipa" instead of "dist-ipa" so it indicates to use a device/dev certificate instead of adhoc/dist one.</li>
