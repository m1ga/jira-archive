<h3>Description</h3>

Just updated to Xcode 9 and TiSDK 6.2.1, and everything broke all together when I try to Package to ad hoc.

This is the error I get:

[TRACE] :  Code Signing Error: No profile for team '6E5M3DGMBX' matching 'my cert adhoc' found:  Xcode couldn't find any provisioning profiles matching '6E5M3DGMBX/my cert adhoc'. Install the profile (by dragging and dropping it onto Xcode's dock item) or select a different one in the General tab of the target editor.
[TRACE] :  Code Signing Error: Code signing is required for product type 'Application' in SDK 'iOS 11.0'

(This was working fine until the update, so the certificates and the private keys are correctly imported)


EDITED:

The problem is that the project.pbxproj is created with the DEVELOPMENT_TEAM value set as the *bundle* identifier instead of the *Team* identifier. If you open the xcode project and then fix it from the General menu, the DEVELOPMENT_TEAM value will be eventually right.

   The <code>DEVELOPMENT_TEAM</code> is set to the <code>appPrefix</code> from the selected provisioning profile which is the same thing as the team id. It should not be setting the bundle identifier. "6E5M3DGMBX" looks like a team id, not a bundle identifier.
   
   FWIW, I had the same problem and I simply need to recreate my provisioning profiles and things started working again.
   
   Furthermore, I submitted a PR yesterday for TIMOB-25318 which improves the provisioning profile validation to ensure that the selected developer/distribution cert is assigned to the selected provisioning profile. The goal is to fail as soon as possible.
   
   If you would please try recreating your provisioning profile and try again, then report back your results. If it works, then we can resolve this ticket. Thank you!</li>

   I did what you suggested but I get the same error.
   
   6E5M3DGMBX is the appPrefix

   but the team identifier is written right in the provisioning:
   
   </array>
   	<key>TeamIdentifier</key>
   	<array>
   		<string>4V676W935X</string>
   	</array>
   	<key>TeamName</key>
   	<string>Company SRL</string>
   	<key>TimeToLive</key>
   	<integer>60</integer>
   	<key>UUID</key>
   	<string>237a354d-XXX</string>
   	<key>Version</key>
   	<integer>1</integer>
   
   If I open the Xcode project it's marked as an error:
   
   !<a href="https://imgur.com/hgHzHMl.png" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://imgur.com/hgHzHMl.png</a>!
   
   and when I select the right provisioning it looks fixed:

   updating to 6.3.0.v20170921125635 didn't fix it. The ticket you linked seems the same error, I will watch it too!</li>

   Resolving as duplicate of TIMOB-25318. You can try out the 6_3_X branch today by using  {{appc ti sdk install -b 6_3_X) or patch the SDK manually by using the pull-request referenced in the linked ticket. Thanks!</li>

   Ok I had the same exact problems as everyone else.
   
   Upgraded to 6.3.x as noted above by Hans.
   
   Problem is NOT solved.  Still the same problem.  
   
   I copied my project to a new folder and did a fresh import
   
   The freshly imported one doesn't even recognize my certificates and won't allow any kind of build what-so-ever (project can be built from Xcode but I have to manually select the certificates)
   
   Trying to archive directly in Xcode is no good since it doesn't package images or app.js for that matter.   Stuck in a loop here</li>

   Closing as a duplicate. If this is in error, please reopen.</li>
