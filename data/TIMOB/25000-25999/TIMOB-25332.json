However, when I try to run my app built with either Titanium SDK 6.1.x or 6.2.x, the ListView exhibits some very broken behavior. It seems to initially render OK, but if the code attempts to update any rows in the ListView, it starts scrolling uncontrollably and moving all over the place. Something seems to be happening with the height of the updated rows or something causing this issue.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what was changed with the iOS ListView in the most recent iOS SDK, but I believe that's what broke it.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you'd like any more details, thanks!",

Like I touched on, the actual ListView we use is very complex and has a lot going on so it's a bit hard to pinpoint exactly where the difference is between 6.1.x and 6.2.x.\r\n\r\nI've tried going through some recent PRs that touched iOS ListView and reverting them locally to see if the issue was fixed, but haven't had any luck. I think it potentially could be easier to do that and find the PR that's causing the behavior.\r\n\r\nDo you know if there's anywhere that I can find the PRs that touch anything remotely related to ListView, listitems, listsections, etc. that were new for 6.2.0?\r\n\r\nThanks!

Since my ListView worked fine when build with the previous iOS SDK, I'm guessing it must be some change in iOS SDK 11 that's breaking this.

As soon as you can wrap up a drop-in test-case (e.g. a simple app.js with one custom template reproducing this), we will move this to TIMOB and investigate it further.

So I think the (quite easy) fix would be to apply the following snippet after [this line|https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/blob/6_2_X/iphone/Classes/TiUIListView.m#L246] in the {{~/Library/Application Support/Titanium/mobilesdk/osx/6.2.1.GA/iphone/Classes/TiUIListView.m:\r\n{code:objc}\r\n_tableView.estimatedRowHeight = 0;\r\n{code}\r\nMore once we have a test-case.",

I tried to reproduce on a bare-bones ListView app I built last night but I didn't have any luck with the most basic template. \r\n\r\nHowever, the great news is, I think you nailed the fix! The fix you provided seems to work like a charm and with that modification all of the broken behavior seems to disappear. I still have to test a bit more and on an actual device (the simulator did show the broken behavior too though when it was occurring) but at first glance it seems fixed.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if you still want the sample code, which is going to take some more work to try to get breaking (and probably not worth it since it seems you already have fix) but I can continue to test and let you know what I find. Also, if it would help you and your team, I could provide a video of the behavior of the ListView in my actual app without and then with the fix. Please let me know.\r\n\r\nThanks again and I really appreciate the quick response. I will update you tonight either way on further testing and device testing.",
