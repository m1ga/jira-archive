<h3>Description</h3>

After upgrading to Titanium SDK 6 we faced a cretical issue with all ListView/TableViews and ScrollView, that uses this module (<a href="https://github.com/raymondkam/Ti.SwipeRefreshLayout)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/raymondkam/Ti.SwipeRefreshLayout)</a> for pull to refresh,

The issue is as follows:
* Scrol down in a scrollview for example.
* Remove your finger.
* Try to scroll up, you cannot, since the module will capture the event first and refreshes the list.

Before we were using Titanium SDK 6.1.2.GA and it was working as expected.

Thanks,

   [~malhajj], we've added official RefreshControl support to ListViews and TableViews on Android in Titanium v6.2.0.  Perhaps its conflicting with the 3rd party module you're using?  I recommend that you switch over to our RefreshControl in 6.2.0.
   
   Just note that Android ScrollViews do not currently support our RefreshControl. You can assign a RefreshControl to it, but it'll no-op and log a warning that it's not currently supported.
   
   The 3rd party module you're using isn't made by us. So, I recommend that you contact the author about this issue. Titanium's implementation of the vertical ScrollView has been changed to use Google's "NestedScrollView" Java class and I suspect this module needs to be changed to compensate for it.</li>

   [~malhajj], Android RefreshControl support will be added to ScrollViews in Titanium 6.3.0. We'll be releasing a release candidate of 6.3.0 soon. This should solve your problem and you'll no longer need to use that SwipeRefreshLayout module anymore.</li>

   That’s what I’m talking about
   
   Thanks a lot Joshua</li>

   The 6.3.0 RC has been released...
   <a href="http://www.appcelerator.com/blog/2017/10/rc-release-of-titanium-sdk-6-3-0-cli-6-30/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.appcelerator.com/blog/2017/10/rc-release-of-titanium-sdk-6-3-0-cli-6-30/</a>
   
   If you can confirm that this switching to our RefreshControl feature on Android solves your scrolling issues, then that would be great. Thanks.</li>

   I’ve got the time and checked this, I’m glad to say its working for all my cases in listview, Scrollview and besides its also working great while using the module mentioned.
   
   Titanium SDK 6.3.0.GA was used
   
   Well done guys and thanks for these great efforts
