<h3>Description</h3>

On creation everything works as intended. Start scrolling the ListView and it breaks. All rows get resized to the size of the screen as if they were set to TI.UI.FILL.

Sample code is attached. Tested this on SDK version 6.3.0.v20171006185117

   I am having this issue as well.  It only seems to happen when the view with a height of Ti.UI.SIZE has a top and bottom value.  Possibly just a bottom value, but definitely the two together.  I have worked around this by removing the bottom value, wrapping the element in a container view with a vertical layout, and adding an additional view with a height equal to my desired bottom value.</li>

   I've confirmed that this is the same issue as [TIMOB-25376]. Its fix will resolve this issue as well.</li>
