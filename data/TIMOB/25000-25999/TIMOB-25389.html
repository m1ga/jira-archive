<h3>Description</h3>

I searched but did not find any ticket on this issue (very strange). It's a duplicate?

Anyway, the problem is the following:

0) No open simulator
1) Build to iPhone Simulator (for example iPhone 5s)
2) The build is ok, the simulator start the application
3) Build to iPad Simulator (for example iPad Air 2), without close the iPhone Simulator
4) The console says "Launching iOS Simulator". But the iPad Simulator don't start the application and the iPhone Simulator stay open.
5) Close the iPhone Simulator
6) repeat point 3. The iPad Simulator start the application correctly.

   Hello, I have tested the issue. I can't reproduce the issue with SDK 6.2.2.GA and with Xcode 8.3.3. First I launch an app in iPhone 7 plus simulator and later on iPhone 7 simulator. The iPhone 7 plus simulator automatically closes and opens the app in iPhone 7 simulator. Thanks.</li>

   The problem occurs at each start of a different simulator.</li>

   Hello, I was able to reproduce the issue with Xcode 9. Building on other simulator is impossible without manually closing the previous ones. Not sure this is our issue or with Xcode!. I will forward this for farther investigation. </li>

   It seems to me that a very similar thing has already happened a while ago. With older SDK versions.</li>
