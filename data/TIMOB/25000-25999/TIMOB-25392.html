<h3>Description</h3>

Nothing special with my code...this is hit the first time and it works...the second..app crashes

<code><pre>
Ti.Media.showCamera({
  success: function(event) {
    // called when media returned from the camera
    Ti.API.info('Our type was: ' + event.mediaType);
    if (event.mediaType == Ti.Media.MEDIA_TYPE_PHOTO) {

      var photo = event.media;
      if (photo != null) {

      }
    } else {

    }
  },
  cancel: function() {

  },
  error: function(error) {
    // called when there's an error
    var a = Titanium.UI.createAlertDialog({
      title: 'Camera'
    });
    if (error.code == Titanium.Media.NO_CAMERA) {
      a.setMessage('Please run this test on device');
    } else {
      a.setMessage('Unexpected error: ' + error.code);
    }
    a.show();
  },
  saveToPhotoGallery: false,
  allowEditing: false,

   Titanium SDK-version used? iOS version used? And does it work on the iPhone?</li>
<li>Peter Ladis 2017-10-13

   Here are my specs from build
   
   Operating System
     Name                        = Mac OS X
     Version                     = 10.12.6
     Architecture                = 64bit
     # CPUs                      = 8
     Memory                      = 17179869184
   Node.js
     Node.js Version             = 4.8.4
     npm Version                 = 2.15.11
   Titanium CLI
     CLI Version                 = 5.0.14
   Titanium SDK
     SDK Version                 = 6.2.2.GA
     SDK Path                    = /Users/pladis/Library/Application Support/Titanium/mobilesdk/osx/6.2.2.GA
     Target Platform             = iphone
   
   
   ****Note after moving to ios11 and the new SDK...take photo was crashing on iPhone when i had the setting set to "Save to Phone"   by taking that off...iphone works fine....but my users out in the field are complaining about iPad crashes</li>
<li>Peter Ladis 2017-10-13

   IOS is 9.3.5</li>
<li>Hans Knöchel 2017-10-13

   The iOS 11 crash is because Apple requires the new key <code>NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription</code> in addition to <code>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</code> in order to save photos to the gallery. Ti SDK 6.3.0 will throw a readable error log before Apple let's it crash. For the iOS 9.3.5 iPad crash, we'll try to reproduce it. And please add a crash trace-log</li>
<li>Peter Ladis 2017-10-13

   So I'm running on an actually device...it just stops tracing..   says application ended.  Any other suggestions?
   
   I added this: NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription     but i have since turned off all saving to library feature.  and the iPad is still crashing</li>
<li>Peter Ladis 2017-10-13

   Also...attaching a photo from library seems to work fine...its only taking a photo.</li>
<li>Peter Ladis 2017-10-13

   my users had not issue with 6.2.0   should i move the app back?</li>
<li>Hans Knöchel 2017-10-15

   Thank you for the insight Peter! If it did not happen in 6.2.0, then that's even more interesting. If possible, are you able to see if it works in 6.2.1? I checked the underlaying code but it did not change anything related in Ti.Media, so it has to to something different to look into.
   
   *EDIT*: Both 6.2.1 and 6.2.2 did not change any iOS sources (only CLI-changes and Android-fixes). Are you sure 6.2.0 works fine? Also, does using Xcode 8 change the situation? Trying hard to troubleshoot this.</li>
<li>Peter Ladis 2017-10-15

   OK so i went back to 6.2.1  and it works.    Moving to 6.2.0...first time i tried to take a picture it crashed....Same code..same device</li>
<li>Hans Knöchel 2018-07-19

    Resolving as cannot reproduce, since our internal tests all passed and the kind of error suggests missing Info.plist permissions.</li>
