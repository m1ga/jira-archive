<h3>Description</h3>

Hi guys, I'm facing some problems since last friday afternoon.
At first, forward geocoding is not responding and throws certificate error(see attachment).
I tried to uninstall and reinstall my app, and it's throwing same error when I want to subscribe to push notifications channel.
I've got newest version of SDK and Studio as well. At friday morning(13.10.2017@08:00 UTC+1) was everything ok...
Please take a look and let me know if there is some workaround and fix it asap.
Thank you

edit: subscribe to push notification channel is functional on Android, error message pops out on iOS...

   Hi guys,
   I found temporary workaround to fix the problem.
   I overwrote GeolocationModule.m in SDK folder and set up http url instead of https.
   Steps to fix:
   1. Go to 
   Users/<userName>/Library/Application Support/Titanium/mobilesdk/osx/6.2.2GA/iphone/Classes/GeolocationModule.m
   2. open GeolocationModule.m in Xcode
   3. find <a href="https://api.appcelerator.net/p/v1/geo" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://api.appcelerator.net/p/v1/geo</a> (line 51 or so)
   4. replace hex string 
   {color:red}68747470733a2f2f6170692e61707063656c657261746f722e6e65742f702f76312f67656f{color} with {color:#14892c}687474703a2f2f6170692e61707063656c657261746f722e6e65742f702f76312f67656f{color}
   5. save 
   6. in Appc studio - Project->Clean
   7.Enjoy :)
   {color:#d04437}Warning: the new hex string is for http version of url api.appcelerator.net, so your communication will not be encrypted. Please advice, that using this fix is on your own responsibility, better solution is wait for guys to fix problem with certificate{color}
   
   Edit: when I enter that https url to chrome, it throws similar error:
   This server could not prove that it is api.appcelerator.net; its security certificate expired 3 days ago. This may be caused by a misconfiguration or an attacker intercepting your connection.
   
   So renew of ssl certificate should fix this problem...</li>

   Thanks [~max87], we are aware of the issue and currently addressing it!</li>
<li>Luc-Edmond Gaspard  2017-10-16

   [~max87] : You can also set the url to <a href="https://api.appcelerator.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://api.appcelerator.com</a>, which is the domain that the android version uses, and has a valid certificate.

   @Luc-Edmond Gaspard - Thanks for your advice, I'll try it.</li>

   An updated certificate was applied on this API.  The issue should now be resolved.</li>
<li>Tony DiPentino 2017-10-16

   When researching I found that the SSL cert used by marketplace api was not on the legacy haproxy. Even thought the proxy was updated this node was not which cause the failures. I have since moved all the api from this old node and added to haproxy. Additionally I've added .net SSL cert checks to our wiki process to search nodes for .net in the future.</li>
