<h3>Description</h3>

*Description*
An app built with remote security policy is expected to pop up an alert when the device is offline. This used to work for SDK < 6.0.4. However, for SDK versions 6.0.4 - 6.2.2 (current GA), the alert does not pop up and stays on the splash screen. This is a regression.

*Steps to reproduce*
1. Create a default classic app.
2. Add this to tiapp.xml:
<code><pre>
&lt;property name="appc-sourcecode-encryption-policy" type="string"&gt;remote&lt;/property&gt;
</pre></code>
3. Set up the test device to have no network connectivity.
4. Build and launch the app to an Android device.

*Actual Results*
For the affected versions, the app stays at the launch screen, and the expected pop up alert does not pop up.

*Expected Results*
An alert should pop up.

   Passed FR. [~fmiao] can you please merge?
   </li>
<li>Feon Sua Xin Miao 2017-11-14

   [~amukherjee], pending <code>appc-cli-titanium</code> PR update. </li>
<li>Hans Kn√∂chel 2017-11-30

   [~amukherjee] This is currently marked for 7.0.1 but seems merged, can we correct the milestone to 7.0.0?</li>
<li>Abir Mukherjee 2017-11-30

   [~hknoechel] I moved it back to 7.0.0. There were some required updates which didn't make it in time for beta, but apparently those changes have made it since then, so I corrected fixVersion back to 7.0.0.</li>
<li>Abir Mukherjee 2017-12-01

   Verified that fix is in RC 7.0.0 build.</li>

   Re-opening since this is still an issue... or perhaps the fix wasn't up-ported.
   I was able to reproduce it in 7.3.0, 6.3.0, 6.1.1, and 6.0.4.
   It works in 6.0.2.</li>

   This issue needs to be fixed on the CLI side. To be fixed by ticket: [CLI-1343]</li>
