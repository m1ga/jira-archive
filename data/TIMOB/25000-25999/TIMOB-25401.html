<h3>Description</h3>

We've been trying to use 3rd party Pods, Frameworks and Libraries with Hyperloop and we've been running into issues.  It seems that when you step up from the trivial Pods like GLCalendar and JBChartView, Hyperloop seems to break down.

Again, we're using the hyperloop_examples app since that is a known good app that works with Hyperloop.

The Pods we added were for Flurry and Contentful.  

<code><pre>
install! 'cocoapods',
         :integrate_targets => false

platform :ios, '8.0'
target 'Hyperloop_Sample' do
	pod 'JBChartView'
	pod 'GLCalendarView', '~> 1.2'
	pod 'Shimmer'
	pod 'Flurry-iOS-SDK/FlurrySDK'
	pod 'ContentfulDeliveryAPI'
end
</pre></code>

In the case of Contentful, it tries to load these .js files, but they aren't there (see below).  

The same happens when we load the Flurry Pod - except in that case there are no source .m files, just a .a library file and it doesn't seem to recognize any classes at all.

My colleague also believes that having hyphens in the names may be having an impact in the case of the Flurry SDK.

In the end, if you try to use these Pods, it can't resolve references to the 'require' because there are no files generated like cdaclient.js

   Have also tested this against the Parse Pod with the same results - no code generated.
   
   Should also point out that this is a Clean install on new out-of-the-box machine so there isn't any leftover code.  Just the very latest Studio and SDKs.</li>
<li>Hans Kn√∂chel 2017-10-17

   This is very likely resolved by the major improvements in Hyperloop 2.2.0, can you confirm [~jvennemann]? [~jfalcone] I'll get in touch with you to try it out before the GA :-).</li>
<li>Jan Vennemann 2017-10-19

   Usage of the Contentful SDK Pod is resolved with Hyperloop 2.2.0. The hyphen issue unfortunately didn't make the cut for the upcoming release so i opened TIMOB-25413 to track the progress there.</li>
<li>Eric Wieber 2017-10-19

   Closing as the ContentfulDeliveryAPI issues are resolved by TIMOB-25393 and TIMOB-25402 and the hyphen issue will be addressed in Hyperloop 2.3.0 (TIMOB-25413)</li>
