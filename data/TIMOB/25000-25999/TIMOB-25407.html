<h3>Description</h3>

When building with Xcode 9 and iOS 11 the menu option Debug -> Location does not show the standard locations (apple etc) and custom location does not set location.
Using location services / get location etc in app produces a GPS error.

Building to 10.3 or below shows the locations correctly and location works as expected

   Looks like Xcode 9 changes the default behavior (see [this related thread](<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24951590/xcode-debug-simulate-location-menu-item-not-available-greyed-out)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24951590/xcode-debug-simulate-location-menu-item-not-available-greyed-out)</a> and [this Apple thread](<a href="https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/83599))." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/83599)).</a> Please also ensure to include the new <code>NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription</code> property in your plist.</li>

   NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription is defined and the location works fine with iOS 11 on the device just not in the simulator, the simulator (especially the iphone X one) also runs quite slow.
   
   However, if you close the appcelerator launched simulator and launch the Xcode one, all works fine.</li>

   This seems to be resolved in Studio v5.0 and latest XCode</li>

   Happy to hear, thank you! I am still curious if it was Xcode or Appc-Studio, because Appc-Studio didn't really change much in that direction. But in any case, thanks for the feedback -> Resolving!</li>
