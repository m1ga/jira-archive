<h3>Description</h3>

I am unable to run App on the device with the latest RC release. Always I get the following error

[ERROR] :  Invalid "--pp-uuid" value "84f52c42-df58-40e6-b133-7fe24409decc"
For help, run: titanium.js help build

On emulator, I got this error for Alloy App 

[ERROR] :  Detected legacy "DefaultIcon.png/DefaultIcon-<platform>.png" in project directory.
[ERROR] :  Please move "DefaultIcon.png/DefaultIcon-<platform>.png" to "/app" for Alloy 1.10.0 or later.
[ERROR] :  Alloy compiler failed

But If I move the image file as described then it works as expected.

Thanks

   <code>DefaultIcon.png</code> will be handled by ALOY-1318. 
   <code>--pp-uuid</code> error, I can't reproduce it. According to [~amukherjee], he couldn't either. <code>ti info</code> output looks fine. If anyone manage to reproduce, please provide debug output, logs. Thanks!
   
   [~morahman], please also attach debug output for <code>DEBUG=* appc run -p ios -T device --pp-uuid 84f52c42-df58-40e6-b133-7fe24409decc</code></li>

   From the debug log, <code>[ERROR] Specified provisioning profile UUID "779ed0a1-6ab2-439b-b30f-e39f23e90c2c" does not include the "Aziz Ahmad (63BQJ23J78)" certificate</code>, it seems to be triggered by TIMOB-25318, which added stricter validation around provisioning profiles.
   
   [~morahman], can you try recreate a provisioning profile, make sure the dev cert is assigned to the provisioning profile.

   Everything I have newly created development certificate, development provisioning profile but still facing the same issue. Please see the error.txt and New_appc ti info -t ios.txt file.
   
   Thanks</li>

   Finally, I can run successfully. The problem was with an expired development certificate. I had two certificates one is valid another on is expired. I deleted my expired certificate from the keychain >>My certificate category but it was still in "Certificate" category. 
   
   My Old Ti SDK did not create any problem with that expired certificate but RC one was not able to detect the valid certificate and provisioning profile. After deleting that expired certificate it works as expected. Thanks [~fmiao].</li>

   Same here, after cleaning all the certificates from the keychain except the ones in use, I can now build the App and submit to the App Store.</li>

   *To Reproduce*
   1. install more than one development certificate that has the same identify
   2. for each of the certs, create a provisioning profile that has the cert assigned
   3. remove the private key of the certificate that expires the earliest
   4. build to device using  <code>--pp-uuid</code>, passing each of the provisioning profile id. 
   
   Please test with Xcode 9 & 8, for thoroughness 7 also. :)</li>

   FR Passed. Able to see all valid profiles when trying to build with multiple certs with the same identity. </li>
