<h3>Description</h3>

The biggest requirement in Titanium for Android platform is to have Android's RecyclerView which elegantly handles thousands of views especially when it comes to use ImageView.

I have seen many many devs saying that their Android app is not performing well due to not able to handle Images effectively like native Android apps do using RecyclerView.

Creating an app which deals with images like E-Commerce apps (most wide domain of apps developed nowadays), media apps, portfolio apps, services apps, etc. all have a very high usage to show images & Titanium just fails in it despite of doing every optimisation task. But native Android devs hardly worry about this now as they have great RecyclerView in their hand.

For example, if we create Titanium Android app showing 20-30 images in a 2x2 column grid in ListView or TableView, it will start feeling slow & will start consuming a huge RAM causing it to crash after some usage time.

I have recently created an Android module which utilises the RecyclerView to show all gallery pictures & I have never seen this much better performance in any Titanium app. So it will be very grateful for Titanium devs to have RecyclerView.

   Hello, Thanks for the ticket. Our engineers will look into it. But right now this is not considered as a high priority, cause so many other requests are in our pipeline for production. Beside a 3rd party module already offers a solution. We will keep this open for now. You will be notified if and when we decide to move this to production. Thanks.</li>

   Thanks for update @Sharif, I totally understand it's not required right now due to a tight pipeline of other tasks, but Ti community would love to have it Ti SDK 7 or above. After all, this feature will increase the performance drastically. Also, can you please post the link for the module you commented about here? </li>
