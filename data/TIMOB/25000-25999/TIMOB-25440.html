   This is a general issue where you cannot run version-specific code on older devices. Will move and rename it, thanks for reporting this!
   
   [~jvennemann] That's what we discussed a few days ago. I have no final plan for this, yet, but as the error occurs with referencing the iOS framework (not the actual API) that's only available in a certain version and higher (in this case: "Speech.framework", iOS 10+), we may be able to solve this by guarding the frameworks with their iOS version if their version is higher then the default one (e.g. 8.1 in our case).
   
   I could even think of a workaround: If we pass link the framework via the appc.js, we can pass linker-flags as well, so something like I've done in my [ARKit module](<a href="https://github.com/hansemannn/titanium-arkit/blob/master/module.xcconfig)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/hansemannn/titanium-arkit/blob/master/module.xcconfig)</a> maybe. Btw, this could eventually be a module-related issue as well, as we don't need the module.xcconfig there anymore and frameworks are linked automatically. If we can ensure to pass them to the correct architecture and version, we should be fine!</li>

   [~jvennemann] Do we have an estimated timeline for when these will be released? 
   Best regards,

   [~vvazquezmontero] Hyperloop 2.2.3 is released [since last week](<a href="https://github.com/appcelerator-modules/hyperloop-builds/releases/tag/v2.2.3)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator-modules/hyperloop-builds/releases/tag/v2.2.3)</a> already, but it hasn't been pushed to the platform so far. It will be published this week!</li>
