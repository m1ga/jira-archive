   1. please include CLI version you used to create the app.
   2. does this happen with only SDK 6.2.2.GA or this is the case for other SDK versions?</li>

   Hi Feon,
   
   This seem to be the case with previous versions. Easiest option is to create a basic alloy app and run it via the Studio.
   
   Node.js
     Node.js Version             = 6.10.3
     npm Version                 = 3.10.10
   
   Appcelerator CLI
     Installer                   = 4.2.9
     Core Package                = 6.2.4
   
   Titanium CLI
     CLI Version                 = 5.0.14
     node-appc Version           = 0.2.41
   </li>

   Move to SDK.</li>

   There are a few things to check first, because I believe it's a non-issue:
   * The app-icon is shown by default when using storyboards
   * If you want to use a custom storyboard, it has to be in app/platform/ios (Alloy) or Resources (classic Titanium)
   * Storyboards are cached by the iOS Simulator, so the Simulator needs to be resetted (there's an option in the Menu of the iOS Simulator to erase contents and settings)
   * When using custom images, you should pass the hash of the image, because the asset-catalog in Titanium (currently) uses hashed image-identifiers by avoid naming-collisions
   * See the [iOS Launch Files](<a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#</a>!/guide/iOS_Launch_Files) wiki for more infos
   
   I have quite a few storyboards running successfully, even more complex ones with split-screens, tabgroups and custom icons, so let me know if you have more issues.</li>

   Hi Hans,
   
   Thanks for the feedback. 
   
   Yes, disabling "< enable-launch-screen-storyboard>" in tiapp.xml fixed the problem I was facing. However, there is no information in the documentation, <a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#</a>!/guide/Icons_and_Splash_Screens, regarding this. 
   
   I will raise a JIRA ticket to include info about storyboards and splay screens. 
   </li>

   Again: This is no bug and the default behavior if no custom storyboard is set. The guide could receive love though :-)</li>

   Closing as "not our bug". If you disagree, please reopen.</li>
