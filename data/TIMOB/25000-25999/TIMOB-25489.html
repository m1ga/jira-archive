<h3>Description</h3>

Hi guys,
I want to use external android library with Hyperloop, but it throws following error: 
<code><pre>
2017-11-08T06:58:44.388Z | ERROR  | An uncaught exception was thrown!
abi is not defined
2017-11-08T06:58:44.392Z | ERROR  | abi is not defined
[ERROR] Application Installer abnormal process termination. Process exit value was 1
</pre></code>

It throws this error after logging "Writing unsigned apk".
I tried to specify abi in tiapp.xml file: <code><pre>&lt;abi&gt;armeabi-v7a&lt;/abi&gt;</pre></code>
When I remove that library(aar), app runs fine.
This lib we used in native app which I'm recoding to Appc, so the file is fine...
Have you any advices?
Thanks

   This is an incomplete work around. If the .aar file has resources in it that are used by the library, or needed by the app to use the library properly, simply extracting the .jar file will not be sufficient. There are a lot of third-party libraries like this.</li>

   Hi Ranando, 
   yes, it's only workaround, but with this you can at least build app and use some of the funcionality.
   It's not ideal, I know, but we have to wait for Appc guys to fix this bug.

   [~max87], could you give us some more info so we can reproduce the behavior you are seeing? Which library causes this issue? Providing a minimal working example project also helps a lot to quickly identify the cause of your issue. Thanks!</li>

   HI Jan,
   I use Sygic SDK to implement their's map view and navigation.
   Unfortunately it's paid sdk(you can download it as a demo and try to implement).
   Thanks</li>
