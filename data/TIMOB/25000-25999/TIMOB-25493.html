<h3>Description</h3>

Hi,
What I want to know is if the protocol being used by the Studio Debugging Perspective is the same when the target is Android and when the target is iOS. I am not asking about how to debug an app, but rather technical details about how debugging are being implemented for the different platforms. I already know that on Android, when "--debug-host" is specified, the app is debuggable using the v8-debugger-protocol. What I want to know is if libti_ios_debugger implements the same protocol or a different one.

Thanks

   Short answer: no, and "it's complicated".
   
   Longer answer:  
   
   **iOS**: With SDK 6.0+ we introduced a new debugger for iOS when using JSCore (and not our TiJSCore fork) that uses the webkit inspector protocol (see <a href="https://github.com/WebKit/webkit/tree/master/Source/JavaScriptCore/inspector/protocol)." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/WebKit/webkit/tree/master/Source/JavaScriptCore/inspector/protocol).</a> So If you use SDk 6.x and have the use-jscore-framework tag set to true in your tiapp.xml it'll use that. With SDK 7.0 JSCore will be the default, so unless you use-jscore-framework tag set to false, it'll use the new debugger by default.
   
   Prior to SDK 6.0 and on TiJSCore, we use proprietary protocol. It's deprecated (as is TiJSCore).
   
   **Android**: With SDK 7.0 we're moving to using the v8 inspector protocol: <a href="https://chromedevtools.github.io/debugger-protocol-viewer/v8/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://chromedevtools.github.io/debugger-protocol-viewer/v8/</a>
   
   Prior to SDK 7.0 we used our own proprietary protocol (that matched the old iOS one). It's deprecated.
