<h3>Description</h3>

Trying to demonstrate Hyperloop and iOS Charts for a customer.  We standard hyperloop demo app that was created by Bert Granges uses the JBChartView cocoa pod.  This used to work in previous versions of the sdk and hyper loop.  I have a new machine, and I have installed the latest version of Studio, Hyperloop, and Ti SDK.  I can't get this to work.  I am guessing that since Hyperloop is now included in the SDK, that something needs to change in this project, but I have spent days and cannot get it to work.  Below is the error.

[INFO] :   [Hyperloop] CocoaPods dependencies found. This will take a few moments but will be cached for subsequent builds
[ERROR] :  An error occurred during build after 12s 605ms
[ERROR] :  pod install returned a non-zero exit code: 1

   Hey [~rwhite], sorry for picking this up so late. But can you try [Hyperloop 2.2.3](<a href="https://github.com/appcelerator-modules/hyperloop-builds/releases/tag/v2.2.3)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator-modules/hyperloop-builds/releases/tag/v2.2.3)</a> (for Titanium SDK 6.x) or [Hyperloop 3.0.1](<a href="https://github.com/appcelerator-modules/hyperloop-builds/releases/tag/v3.0.1)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator-modules/hyperloop-builds/releases/tag/v3.0.1)</a> (for Titanium SDK 7.x). Thank you!
   
   Regarding the error: It looks like a CocoaPods build error. This can sometimes happen if the repo where the project is hosted is temporary down or cached incorrectly. You can force a clean download by deleting the "Pods" directory and the "Podfile.lock" file.</li>

   Thanks Hans.  I was on vacation last week.  I will try your suggestions and get back to you.

   Hans.  I have tried two different hyper loop projects with Titanium 7 and Hyperloop 3.  I get the same errors with both projects.  I am attaching two screenshots - one from the error in Studio, and the other from xCode.  Any ideas?  Thanks for the help.      !Screen Shot 2017-12-05 at 9.04.31 AM.png|thumbnail!  !Screen Shot 2017-12-05 at 8.58.54 AM.png|thumbnail! </li>

   Yes.  And sorry - that last comment should have been addressed to you, not Eric.  I'm not quite awake yet.

   This shouldn't be an issue anymore. Let me know in case it is!</li>
