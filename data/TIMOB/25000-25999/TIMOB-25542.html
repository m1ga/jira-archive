<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Issue Description </h4>
Issue: When wrapping view(s) within an outer view, and a click event listener is added to that outer view, and all of this is in a standalone alloy controller, the feedback gotten from the click event object in regards to what the source of the click is, is incorrect. 

SAMPLE PROJECT: 
<a href="https://propelics.box.com/s/o7uaqpvwwtd41g71gurdgg9022obdjal" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://propelics.box.com/s/o7uaqpvwwtd41g71gurdgg9022obdjal</a> 

STEPS TO REPRODUCE: 
1.- Open and run sample project. Can be deployed with -T ws-local 
2.- A window with two views will appear: one white with a smaller red view in within and one cyan with a smaller purple view in within. 
3.- Click on the red inner view of the white view and observe the console output: the event object will print with a source.id = "moreButton", which is correct, as you'll can verify in the contents of index.xml. 
4.- Now click on the purple inner view of the cyan view and observe the console output: the event object will print with a source.id = "siteTab", which is incorrect, as you can verify in the contents of smallerViewController.xml. 

As demonstrated, this is only reproducible in standalone alloy controllers. 

NOTE: Exact the same behavior happens with a Ti.UI.Button.
