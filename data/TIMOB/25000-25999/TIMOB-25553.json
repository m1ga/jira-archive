		"description": "Hi,\r\n\r\nThis is a new feature requested to support XEN mobile in iOS with services such as analytics.\r\n\r\nDescription: \r\n\r\nIf you simply are creating an app, and not trying to wrap it, then you could use it. Now as to why the app would have trouble, at the \"MAM\" part of the solution to ensure that the app is allowed to communicate. If analytics is turned on (default) or other things like remote key encryption are enabled, the app will need to communicate with our back end. If unable, it might not work as expected. If they are wrapping, then there might be issues with that process.\r\nhttps://www.citrix.com/products/xenmobile/\r\n\r\nThanks ",
