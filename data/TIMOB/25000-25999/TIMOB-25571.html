<h3>Description</h3>

When using Titanium SDK 7.0.0 and CocoaPods in Hyperloop, the build seems to fail due to invalid UUID-values of the certificate used. We didn't change anything related, but Cocoapods may override build settings that could cause it. To be investigated.

   [~kbrand], would you mind uploading a complete trace log of your failed adhoc build? That would help a lot, thank you!</li>
<li>Kristjan Brand 2017-11-30

   [~jvennemann] can i e-mail it to you somewhere? I don't want my distribution name and adhoc UUID to be public here.</li>
<li>Jan Vennemann 2017-11-30

   Sure, just shoot me an email at [mailto:jvennemann@axway.com] with the log!</li>

   Hi Any updates on this ticket we are also facing the same problem with 
   Ti SDK 7.0.2 and hyperloop 3.0.2?
   And not able to create any builds!</li>

   *EDIT*: Here is the real issue:
   
   The real issue is still CocoaPods, but a different one: When using frameworks, some can be Bitcode-enabled and some not. CocoaPods may not know how to handle that, so in the native world you would configure some frameworks implicitly to disable Bitcode, which Titanium does as well. Long story short: For some of them, it cannot detect it (when frameworks are managed by CocoaPods), so adding the following snippet to the end of your <code>Podfile</code> solves it (tested successfully with the Hyperloop Sample App):
   <code><pre>
   post_install do |installer|
     installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
       target.build_configurations.each do |config|
         config.build_settings['ENABLE_BITCODE'] = 'NO'
       end
     end
   end
   </pre></code>
   
   Also added a note to the [Hyperloop Docs#CocoaPods](<a href="https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides2/iOS+Hyperloop+Programming+Guide#iOSHyperloopProgrammingGuide-CocoaPods)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides2/iOS+Hyperloop+Programming+Guide#iOSHyperloopProgrammingGuide-CocoaPods)</a> </li>

   Leaving ticket open as this may be resolvable by the SDK as well. cc [~cbarber] [~fmiao]</li>
