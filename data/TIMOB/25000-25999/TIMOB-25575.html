<h3>Description</h3>

We are using the PLDatabase library for all iOS-related Ti.Database tasks for a long time, but it become pretty old-fashioned the last years. 

These days, [FMDB](<a href="https://github.com/ccgus/fmdb)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/ccgus/fmdb)</a> is the recommended layer between the C-based libsqlite-library and Objective-C / Swift. It is recommended in several books like <code>Learning SQLite for iOS</code> and <code>iPhone Advanced Projects</code> and has some obvious advantages:
* Automatic retry handling
* Own SQL-functions
* Asynchronous transactions for improved performance in batch-operations
* Migration mechanisms, using [FMDBMigrationManager](<a href="https://github.com/layerhq/FMDBMigrationManager)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/layerhq/FMDBMigrationManager)</a>

Alternatively, there is [GRDB.swift](<a href="https://github.com/groue/GRDB.swift)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/groue/GRDB.swift)</a> which could (technically) still be used in our Obj-C project, but doesn't seem to be too popular so far.
