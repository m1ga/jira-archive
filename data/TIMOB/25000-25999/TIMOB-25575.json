		"description": "We are using the PLDatabase library for all iOS-related Ti.Database tasks for a long time, but it become pretty old-fashioned the last years. \r\n\r\nThese days, [FMDB|https://github.com/ccgus/fmdb] is the recommended layer between the C-based libsqlite-library and Objective-C / Swift. It is recommended in several books like {{Learning SQLite for iOS}} and {{iPhone Advanced Projects}} and has some obvious advantages:\r\n* Automatic retry handling\r\n* Own SQL-functions\r\n* Asynchronous transactions for improved performance in batch-operations\r\n* Migration mechanisms, using [FMDBMigrationManager|https://github.com/layerhq/FMDBMigrationManager]\r\n\r\nAlternatively, there is [GRDB.swift|https://github.com/groue/GRDB.swift] which could (technically) still be used in our Obj-C project, but doesn't seem to be too popular so far.",
