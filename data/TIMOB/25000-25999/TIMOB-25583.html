   Hello [~efrancis],
   Thanks for sharing with us. Please provide a full sample test code that regenerates the issue. Better to provide a sample app as an attachment here. We will test the issue in our environment. Also, provide the environment details you are testing on.

   Hello [~hknoechel], I was able to reproduce the issue with the below code
   <code><pre>
   var win = Ti.UI.createWindow();
   var search = Titanium.UI.createSearchBar({
   	barColor : '#000',
   	showCancel : true,
   	height : 43,
   	top : 0,
   });
   
   var button = Titanium.UI.createButton({
   	title : 'Hello',
   	top : 100,
   	width : 100,
   	height : 50
   });
   
   button.addEventListener('click', function(e) {
   	Titanium.API.info("You clicked the button");
   	search.focus();
   });
   
   win.add(search);
   win.add(button);
   win.open(); 
   </pre></code>
   
   With searchbar focus, the soft keyboard does not show. Tested with iOS 11.1 simulator with SDK 6.3.0.GA. Moving to TIMOB. Thanks.</li>

   Well, this seems to happen for Android too. In Android, searchbar is already focused on open. But the keyboard is not showing. Also, button clicks to focus the searbar also not show the keyboard. Thanks.</li>

   I verified the give test code on iPhone X (iOS 11.1), iPhone 5s (iOS 11.1) simulator and iPhone 5s (11.0.1) device with 6.3.0.GA. For me it is working fine . Keyboard is getting opened , when I click on "Hello" button. 
   [~sdarda] Is there any particular iOS simulator it is not working on? Can you please check once again. Thanks!</li>
