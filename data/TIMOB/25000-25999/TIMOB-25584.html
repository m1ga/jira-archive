<h3>Description</h3>

When you create a TabGroup control with too many tabs the control automatically creates a "more" tab that shows a listing of additional tabs. The "more" tab does not render appropriately in landscape orientation on iPad. The width of the tab listing does not extend to the right-edge of the screen as it should (please see the attached screenshot).

I've attached a very simple Alloy project that you can use to replicate this issue.

   Forgot to add that this has been an issue for quite some time (a few years now). I posted on Stack Overflow a while back - <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34860030/titanium-tabgroup-control-more-tab-not-rendering-properly?noredirect=1#comment57570247_34860030" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34860030/titanium-tabgroup-control-more-tab-not-rendering-properly?noredirect=1#comment57570247_34860030</a>
   
   I thought I posted it here as well but am not able to find it so I could be mistaken. Hoping you can fix it soon.</li>

   Hello, I don't see there is an issue here. First, the more tabs do render in landscape orientation on iPad. I can see the more tab in your screenshot. Second, The position is right. there is an additional space on the right and left, But this is by default design. And I can see it is extended to the whole screen. Can you please be clear on your issue? Please explain what you think the issue here. Some visualization would be better. So far testing your sample app I don't see any issue. here. Thanks.</li>

   Sharif,
   
   I've attached an annotated copy of the screenshot. The row dividers and arrows do not extend to the right margin as they are supposed to. If you look you'll see the left margin is much less than the right margin. If you open the app I supplied in portrait mode you will see the margin on the left and right is identical. When you switch to landscape mode it doesn't update the right margin properly.
   
   This used to work perfect in very early versions of Titanium (we've been a customer for a long time). It broke a few years back.

   This is not a Titanium issue. Like discussed on Slack, the same happens for native apps (see the attached screenshot and native project). I do agree it should have the full width, but for whatever reason Apple decided to not do it, it's not something we can influence as the list of additional tabs is generated by iOS internally.
   
   Please consult Apple and file a bug at bugreport.apple.com like you filed here, maybe they will offer at least more configuration in the future if more and more devs report the issue. Thanks!</li>

   Closing as "not our bug". If you disagree, please reopen.</li>
