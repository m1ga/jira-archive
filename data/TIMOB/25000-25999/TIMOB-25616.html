<h3>Description</h3>

In TIMOB-25017, we've been seeing that the persistent in app properties are erased every time on the installation. We found that it is because WinAppDeployCmd fails when same version of the app is already installed, and then Titanium tries to uninstall existing app in order to complete the installation. We can suppress the uninstallation by bumping up the version in the tiapp.xml everytime on deployment, but sometimes uninstallation can be done unintentionally when you forget the bump. We might want a new option to suppress unintentional uninstallation by forcing <code>--forceUnInstall</code> or something explicitly.

   Here's some starting point to discuss:
   
   - Do we accept the difference between version numbering in tiapp.xml and actual app? Note that Developers may want to determine specific version number for the release build.
   - We could introduce special placeholder like <code>&lt;version&gt;1.0.*&lt;/version&gt;</code> but this may cause breaking change and parity issue between platforms. Do we wan to do like this? Or we could just say "If you omit the build number, we just automatically increment it behind scenes, only on Windows platform".
   - Do we accept this breaking change regarding new version numbering spec? 
   - Do we want to enable it by default? Otherwise do we want to introduce new property in tiapp.xml like <code>&lt;enable-auto-build-numvering/&gt; or so</code>?
   - Do we want to introduce this new version numbering spec for other platforms? Do we want to keep parity for it?
   - Do we want to make it configurable from Appc Studio? For instance ["Automatically increment" checkbox in UWP packager](<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/packaging/images/packaging-screen5.jpg)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/packaging/images/packaging-screen5.jpg)</a>
