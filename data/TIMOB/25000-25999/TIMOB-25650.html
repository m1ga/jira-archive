<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Description</h4>

I believe the babel 7 release is a little while off (it's been cooking since February 2017), but I wanted to get a ticket in to track it on our side.

Tasking it out I think the following needs to be done (will maybe break these out into sub-tasks of this ticket)

* Update node-titanium-sdk
** Move to <code>@babel/core, @babel/traverse, @babel/types, babel-preset-minify</code>, and upgrading <code>babylon</code>
* titanium_mobile/titanium_mobile_windows, update all <code>require('babel-X')</code>, as needed

* Ensure nothing is broke :)

It might be worthwhile getting some feature branches setup to get some builds setup with the beta versions of these (currently 7.0.0-beta.36 at time of writing)

Some reading that might be useful

   Alloy was split out to ALOY-1629 and this ticket does not depend on that being resolved</li>

   Windows changes still need doing (I'll do that)
   
   Edit: Took a quick look  
   
   * The Windows repo can have the code there that uses babel packages nuked as it's to only handle hyperloop 2.2.0 and below
   * We also use babel packages in all hyperloop plugins! iOS and Android look to specify that they use 6.x in their package.json, Windows looks to just pull from the sdk?? Need to check that wont break!</li>

   [~eharris] Is it okay to close this ticket?</li>
<li>Ewan Harris 2019-01-07

   [~smohammed] I believe it should be, TIMOB-26564 and TIMOB-26565 have been fixed (however TIMOB-26565 is not in the SDK yet AFAICT). If you have the time, could you validate TIMOB-26117 while closing this, as it should be fixed by this ticket.</li>
