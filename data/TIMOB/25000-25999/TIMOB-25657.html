   Hello [~jignesh.igp],
   Thanks for sharing with us. Please provide a full sample test code that regenerates the issue. Better to provide a sample app as an attachment here. We will test the issue in our environment. Also, provide the SDK and CLI version you are testing on.

   Hey there! Checking it now - but I see you are using an outdated Xcode version (8.3.2) that is quite outdated (currently: 9.2). I am moving this ticket to engineering for reproducing your test-case, but if it works with the recommended setup (Xcode 9.2), you will need to update your dev-environment. Thanks!
   
   P.S.: I've also changed your tiapp.xml to not include your organization keys.
   
   Update: I've just tested your supplied code and it works fine (both Simulator and Device). I am highly expecting it to be an issue with an external module that used private API's that have been removed or replaced between the major releases 6 and 7. 
   
   I don't want to leave you with an open issue, so I propose you to attach a full trace log (Studio: Change to log-level switch above the console to "Trace", CLI: <code>appc run -p ios -l trace</code>).
   
   Doing that, we'll be able to see the actual error that breaks the build. Lets give it a shot!</li>
<li>Jignesh Kasundra 2018-01-10

   Used CLI: *appc run -p ios -l trace* and it's throws below error in middle of build process
   
   [TRACE] ld: framework not found FileProvider for architecture x86_64
   [TRACE] clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)
   [ERROR] ** BUILD FAILED **
   [ERROR] The following build commands failed:
   [ERROR]         Ld build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/SampleApp.app/SampleApp normal x86_64
   [ERROR] (1 failure)
   
   please let me know if you want to look full logs.

   Thanks, <code>ld: framework not found FileProvider for architecture x86_64</code> is the issue. Which is because Xcode 9 is required (The <code>FileProvider</code> framework is a core-framework). As a workaround, see [this answer](<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/46483043/5537752)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://stackoverflow.com/a/46483043/5537752)</a> that was solving the issue that also occurred on other development platforms.</li>
