<h3>Description</h3>

As a developer,
I want to be able to use libraries that depend on JavaScript Promises,
So that I can have out-0f-box support for a wider range of modules.

<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises</a>

I have been using JavaScript promises in my code for years but the only way to use modules that depend on Promises is to add support myself.  It would be great if Titanium added built-in support for Promises.

I think it would be a relatively small change.  Just add bluebird (<a href="http://bluebirdjs.com/docs/getting-started.html)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://bluebirdjs.com/docs/getting-started.html)</a> and add a global variable "Promise". 

Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks!

   Available in 7.1.0 and later as part of the ES6+ support. No additional libraries required anymore. </li>
