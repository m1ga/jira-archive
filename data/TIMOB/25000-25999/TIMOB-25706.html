<h3>Description</h3>

It would be useful to define in the tiapp.xml file different versions of the SDK to be used according to the platform.

Currently I am in the problem of needing to use the latest version of SDK (7+) for iOS, while for Android I am forced to stay in version 6.3 as some third-party modules are not compatible with SDK 7+ (not they are 64bit).

Similar problem I had with the change to the requirements for the android modules with the SDK 6 (many modules have been updated after months).

   Hello [~sandrolain], Whats the status of your issue? Thanks.</li>

   Hello, your previous comment seems to be out of context compared to what is described in the issue.
   The question that I have placed is not about the cloud or push notifications, but about the version of the Titanium SDK.
   Thanks.</li>

   Hello [~sandrolain], I apologize for my previous mistake, Thanks for submitting the ticket, Our engineers will look in to it. There is no time frame of this implementation. Currently, as a workaround, you can do
   
   1. Separate build on different platform with the desireSDKs, 
   2. You can post a comment to the third party module builder and ask for a version upgrade for the module with the latest SDK. 
   
   Thanks.</li>

   Hello
   Yes, actually I compile the iOS and Android versions by previously modifying the SDK in the tiapp.xml file.
   For some third-party developer modules I requested an update, but almost always I did not get an answer. In some cases they are modules that have not been developed for several months and are "locked" to versions that are no longer supported.</li>

   We will keep the ticket open, But the improvement will take time, Our engineers will consider and decide whether/when this will be implemented. Thanks.</li>
