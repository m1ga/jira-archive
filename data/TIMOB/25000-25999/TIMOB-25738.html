<h3>Description</h3>

Running watch apps in the simulator doesn't work in Titanium 7.0.2 RC. Adding the <code>--launch-watch-app</code> option to an <code>appc run</code> command is supposed to launch a watch simulator with the watch app, but the watch simulator never launches. Below is the output; you can see the watch simulator is named null. 

This is increasingly urgent for us; we have been waiting for 7.0.2 to even be able to package the watch app. We haven't been able to ship an update to our app for many weeks now. We can't afford to have this drag out, so any workaround would be appreciated.

   [~ewieber] Can you try to reproduce this?</li>

   I am able to reproduce this issue with the same logs as provided. [~fmiao], this is the ioslib issue we encountered</li>

   Xcode 9 combined both the iOS Simulator and Watch Simulator into a single "Simulator" app. It runs each simulator in a different window, each simulator with their own <code>system.log</code> file. Furthermore, the <code>system.log</code> files do not appear to include any installation messages so we can't tail for when the app is installed, however the call to <code>simctl install</code> just happens to be blocking until the app is installed in both the iOS simulator and the Watch simulator, so now we don't have to wait for the app to be installed, just wait for <code>simctl install</code> to finish.</li>

   FR Passed. I am able to launch projects with watch apps without issue. Tested by creating several different projects with watch apps, building them with different options, and seeing that each launched as expected</li>

   Verified in SDK builds 7.0.2.v20180205145048 & 7.1.0.v20180205203710</li>
