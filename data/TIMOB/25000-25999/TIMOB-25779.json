Finally, I expect that you all have a proper silent push environment set up, e.g. {{UIBackgroundModes}} containing the {{remote-notification}} key as documented [in the docs|http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#!/api/Titanium.App.iOS-event-silentpush]:\r\n{code:xml}\r\n    <ios>\r\n        <plist>\r\n            <dict>\r\n                <key>UIBackgroundModes</key>\r\n                <array>\r\n                    <string>remote-notification</string>\r\n                </array>\r\n                <!-- More keys of the tiapp.xml ... -->\r\n            </dict>\r\n        </plist>\r\n    </ios>\r\n{code}\r\nAnd finally, a [quote from Apple|https://developer.apple.com/library/content/technotes/tn2265/_index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS40010376-CH1-TNTAG23]:\r\n{quote}\r\nIf your notification payload contains the content-available key, your app will receive the notification if iOS or OS X determines it is energy-efficient to do so. If the energy or data budget for the device has been exceeded, your app will not receive any more notifications with the content-available key until the budget has been reset. This occurs once a day and cannot be changed by user or developer action. This throttle is disabled if the app is run from Xcode, so be sure to test your app by running it from the device to have the same user experience your customers will have.\r\n{quote}",

I also checked with iOS 10.3.3 and SDK 6.0.0.GA and saw the same behavior.
