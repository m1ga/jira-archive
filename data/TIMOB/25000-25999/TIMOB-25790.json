					"body": "So, I think there's still a way to \"fix\" liveview to hack the L function in a way that doesn't try to assign to the global \"L\" function: It appears to hijack require itself, and in that it can simply pass a reference to \"L\" that invokes it's own override (right here: https://github.com/appcelerator/liveview/blob/713d920a19f9a6b9a444f3de53d92118ad1439f3/build/liveview.js#L733). That does mean user code could insist on the original L function versus a possibly patched one:\r\n{code:javascript}\r\nglobal.L('my string'); // will always invoke the original method\r\nL('my string'); may invoke the overriden live view version\r\n{code}\r\nI mean this is effectively how it is passing along it's hacked require function, so I don't see why we couldn't do the same for the L override.\r\n\r\nI guess this raises a couple larger points:\r\n- Yes, transpilation could still break user code if they're doing very funky things like this that relied on non-strict behavior (i.e. actually overriding read-only globals!). In non-strict code though, wouldn't this hijacking of L actually silently fail? If the global L function is read-only non-strict code typically would silently ignore bad behavior and strict throws errors. See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode\r\n- Do we want to open up some of our API to be non read-only? Clearly liveview has a use for overriding some builtin API members. But this is beginning to play with fire if we don't want some/all of our API to be read-only.",

Looking at other globals in other environments node doesn't seem to complain when overriding in strict mode (from my fairly limited testing).\r\n\r\nI feel that, while this is fixable in liveview, given that (to my knowledge) we wouldn't be able ship the fix alongside 7.1.0 and that iOS is in the minority of how it behaves, we should be removing the {{kTiPropertyAttributeReadOnly}} on the global properties.",
