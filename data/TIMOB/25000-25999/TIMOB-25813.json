					"body": "[~hknoechel], I think this is impossible on Android.\r\n\r\nThis is because audio formats such as MP3 and AAC require licensing and can involve royalties. So, Android device manufacturers may not provide all audio formats documented by Google in order to reduce cost. Unfortunately, there is no API that'll tell you if the audio recording format is supported on the device.\r\n\r\nThe only guaranteed audio format we can support is WAV.\r\n\r\n*Note:*\r\nIn the past, I used to think all Android devices supported 3GP since that was a free format. It was typically the default format for most devices in the past. But then I discovered one rogue Android device, I think the \"Nabi 2\" kids tablet, that didn't support it. That's when I had to concede that the only sure bet was the WAV format.\r\n\r\nAndroid is the wild west of operating systems. Just because you see a cool feature documented on Google's side doesn't mean all Android devices support it. Especially the Android OS forks... and most of the popular devices are forked like Samsung devices.",
