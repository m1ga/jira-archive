					"body": "This appears to be a hardware acceleration bug on Google's end. In fact, it's a very common issue:\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/17059899/android-webview-hardware-acceleration-artefact-workarounds\r\n\r\nSo, I've found 2 work-arounds:\r\n# Use a \"fixed\" position instead of \"absolute\", if possible. \"fixed\" doesn't appear to have this issue.\r\n# Add a border to your WebView. This will make Titanium disable hardware acceleration on the WebView.\r\n\r\nNote that Titanium used to disable hardware acceleration on the WebView in the past, which was not ideal. In our quest to optimize our UI, we've inadvertently revealed a bug on Google's end. Ideally, you don't want to disable hardware acceleration and work-around it in the HTML side instead for best performance.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you search this topic on stackoverflow, many native developers have found that setting CSS style {{\"webkit-backface-visibility: hidden;\"}} works-around this issue as well. I haven't tried it for myself, but that might be worth pursuing.\r\n\r\nDoes this help?",

					"body": "[~mr.arbindbhagat], setting it to \"fixed\" worked for me, but I had to scroll down to see the label. Not sure why Android's native WebView is using a larger page size (taller than the screen) compared to iOS by default.\r\n\r\nIf you're trying to fit all of the page's content within the screen so that the user does not have to scroll, then you can set the {{WebView.scalesPageToFit}} property to {{true}} to scale it down to fit. I recommend that you set this property when attempting to use the above mentioned work-arounds. Interestingly enough, the \"absolute\" position works-around the bug too, but it may render the content smaller then you'd like. Perhaps adjusting the html/viewport height might help with that on your end.",
