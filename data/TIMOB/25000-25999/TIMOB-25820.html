<h3>Description</h3>

postlayout event doesn't trigger when used on TableViewRow.

To replicate,  create a new Alloy MObile Project.

Replace index.xml contents with below:
Index.xml

<Alloy>
	<Window class="container" id="win" layout="vertical" >
		<TableView width="90%"  height="Titanium.UI.SIZE" top="100"   >
			<TableViewRow onPostlayout="test1" onClick="test2"  >
				<Label text="API Health"  />
			</TableViewRow>
			<TableViewRow id="tvr"  >
				<Label text="Consumer Engagement"  />
			</TableViewRow>
			<TableViewRow   >
				<Label text="API Usage"  />
			</TableViewRow>
			<TableViewRow   >
				<Label text="Infrastructure Health"  />
			</TableViewRow>
		</TableView>
	</Window>
</Alloy>


Replace index.js contents with below:

$.win.open();

function test1() {
	alert("hello");
}

$.tvr.addEventListener("postlayout", test1);

function test2() {
	alert("clicked");
}



You can see the click event is working, but not the postlayout.

   This might be the expected behavior on iOS because of the following background. The underlaying <code>UITableView</code> does not render it's cells like usual views (<code>UIView</code> subclasses). Instead of finishing a layout by having a view on-screen, table-view cells (both for Ti.UI.ListView and Ti.UI.TableView - they use the same native API internally) are rendered off-screen and are presented to the user once they reach the visible area of the scroll-interaction. After "scrolling them away", either up or down, the cells are being destructed again. This is done to ensure the best scrolling-performance across that native API and is decided by the iOS system itself.
   
   Now when it comes to the <code>postlayout</code> event, it is usually called on "normal" views when they finished layouting on the screen, e.g. they have reached their final rect (width / height) and origin (x- / y-position). For table-view-rows, they are always embedded in the vertical stack of cells inside the <code>UITableView</code> or their section, so they won't fire because of that. They also do not fire when their sub-views are ready, because that goes under the rendering-pipeline as discussed above, which "finishes" layouting even before you know that you will use that cell (by using the scroll-direction to determine and prepare the next cells to present). 
   
   That's the long story behind why it does not fire. We *could* make it fire by manually firing the event at some point of the layouting-pipeline, but that's really against what this API is meant for and it should be considered as a native limitation. For sure, we should update the docs to reflect this behavior. I'd love your feedback [~isener]!</li>
