					"body": "This might be the expected behavior on iOS because of the following background. The underlaying {{UITableView}} does not render it's cells like usual views ({{UIView}} subclasses). Instead of finishing a layout by having a view on-screen, table-view cells (both for Ti.UI.ListView and Ti.UI.TableView - they use the same native API internally) are rendered off-screen and are presented to the user once they reach the visible area of the scroll-interaction. After \"scrolling them away\", either up or down, the cells are being destructed again. This is done to ensure the best scrolling-performance across that native API and is decided by the iOS system itself.\r\n\r\nNow when it comes to the {{postlayout}} event, it is usually called on \"normal\" views when they finished layouting on the screen, e.g. they have reached their final rect (width / height) and origin (x- / y-position). For table-view-rows, they are always embedded in the vertical stack of cells inside the {{UITableView}} or their section, so they won't fire because of that. They also do not fire when their sub-views are ready, because that goes under the rendering-pipeline as discussed above, which \"finishes\" layouting even before you know that you will use that cell (by using the scroll-direction to determine and prepare the next cells to present). \r\n\r\nThat's the long story behind why it does not fire. We *could* make it fire by manually firing the event at some point of the layouting-pipeline, but that's really against what this API is meant for and it should be considered as a native limitation. For sure, we should update the docs to reflect this behavior. I'd love your feedback [~isener]!",
