<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Description</h4>

When building with liveview enabled the liveview server does not stop when the build has finished. This usually does not lead to multiple servers being started as the liveview hook calls the /kill endpoint before starting a new server (this is hard coded to 127.0.0.1:8324 so it is actually possible for users who specify a custom port or ip).

<h4>Steps to reproduce</h4>

<h4>Build a project with liveview enabled</h4>
<h4>Kill the build process (red square from studio/ctrl+c from cli)</h4>
<h4>curl 127.0.0.1:8324</h4>

<h4>Actual</h4>

A response like <code>{"pid":47754,"path":"/Users/eharris/Documents/Appcelerator_Studio_Workspace/testbabelstuff/","uptime":12.403,"alloy":false}</code> comes back from the curl

<h4>Expected</h4>

No response as the server should not be running

   Hi, this issue seems to be related to a problem I am experiencing after updating appc cli to 7.0.10 and SDK 8.0.0.GA.
   The execution with liveview continuously reports:
   
   <code><pre>
   Address in use, retrying ...
   Address in use, retrying ...
   Address in use, retrying ...
   </pre></code>
   
   The first startup is successful but after editing a file the update of the files does not take place and the app remains locked in the splash.
   
   By executing the curl request at 127.0.0.1:8324 after the liveview session ends, the response occurs as shown.
   
   Downgrading to cli 7.0.9 and SDK 7.5.1.GA liveview works well.</li>

   [~sandrolain] just to be certain, have you updated to Studio 5.1.2? As this ticket states this issue is mostly a non-issue as liveview kills a running server before starting up, so I would not expect you to hit this unless using a custom IP, which it appears you aren't.
   
   Based off the behaviour you're describing I believe that you are not running Studio 5.1.2 (which updates the Studio distributed liveview to be non-functional on SDK 8+) or you have installed liveview from npm which is not supported and conflicts with the SDK installation.</li>

   I confirm that I am not using the updated version of Appcelerator Studio but only Visual Studio Code with the extension for Appcelerator Titanium:
   <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/vscode-appcelerator-titanium" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/vscode-appcelerator-titanium</a>
   I updated cli and sdk via the command line.</li>
