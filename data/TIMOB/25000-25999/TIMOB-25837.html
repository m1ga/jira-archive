<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Description </h4>

If a babel config (via .babelrc or package.json) is defined in the Titanium project root then babel will pick this up and merge it with the one populated in the SDK. Personally I think that this is valuable, but has the opportunity to cause problems as seen in ALOY-1605. We can disable this by setting the <code>babelrc</code> option in babel-core to false like we do in Alloy

This occurs since 7.0.2.GA, but only occurs when building to device (minification enabled) in that SDK

<h4>Steps to reproduce</h4>

1. Add a file named <code>.babelrc</code> in the root your Titanium project
2. Add { "plugins": \[ "transform-react-jsx" \] \} to the .babelrc
3. Build a Titanium app

<h4>Actual</h4>

Build will fail with <code>\[ERROR\] Unknown plugin "transform-react-jsx" specified in "/Users/eharris/Documents/Appcelerator_Studio_Workspace/ticreateapp/.babelrc" at 0, attempted to resolve relative to "/Users/eharris/Documents/Appcelerator_Studio_Workspace/ticreateapp"</code> as babel-core will pick up the babel config


<h4>Expected</h4>

Not sure, do we allow babel configs to be overidden? If not then the error shouldn't occurs, if so then this ticket is invalid

   cc [~cwilliams] [~emerriman] [~hknoechel] [~gmathews] What do you think, supporting this would totally make this even better, but I think allowing babel to merge the configs might cause the plugin ordering to be off meaning that the global-this custom plugin might not be run last and therefore breaking code like ALOY-1605. I think if we merge manually in node-titanium-sdk we can ensure global-this is placed last which I believe is where it needs to be</li>
