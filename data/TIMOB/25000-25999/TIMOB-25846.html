   Hi [~sonufana4u], do you have links for the native documentation on iOS & Android?</li>

   On iOS, it is technically possible to hide the photo-gallery (aka <code>UIImagePickerController</code>). If the same is possible on Android and Windows, we could consider adding an API for that. Only doing it on iOS would be a bad parity decision, as we need to move forward achieving API's for all platforms. For now, you can use Hyperloop to hide the top most controller as well (using the key-window), something like:
   <code><pre>
   var TiApp = require('Titanium/TiApp');
   var topPresentedController = TiApp.getController().presentingViewController;
   topPresentedController.dismissViewControllerAnimatedCompletion(true, function(e) {
     Ti.API.info('Photo Gallery was dismissed successfully!');
   });
   </pre></code>
   
   *EDIT*: Good news! As the camera uses the same underlaying API, you can also use <code>				Ti.Media.hideCamera()</code> for closing the photo gallery on iOS! But we should still expose it as an own API in the future to prevent possible confusion.</li>
