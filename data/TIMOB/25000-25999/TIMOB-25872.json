Create a different type of error with the server. For example, my /etc/hosts file did not have an entry for 127.0.0.1 localhost, so the actual node error was 'ENOTFOUND'.\r\n2. Create a new titanium app with `appc ti new`.\r\n3. Build with appc ti build -p ios\r\n\r\n*Actual Result*\r\n\r\nBuild errors out with following text:\r\n{code}\r\n    [ERROR] Another process is currently bound to port 27973\r\n    [ERROR] Set a unique <log-server-port> between 1024 and 65535 in the <ios> section of the tiapp.xml\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n*Expected Result*\r\n\r\nMore detailed error. I.E. Something like:\r\n\r\n{code}Failed to create/connect to log server port with error \"[error given by node net package]\".{code}\r\nFollowed by suggested solution. For example if the node error was EADDRINUSE, then you could still use the existing error message. But if it's another error, log accordingly so the user has the best information for solving the issue.",

					"body": "The \"Another process is currently bound to port...\" error indicates that a Titanium app is currently running in an iOS Simulator. There are a couple ways in which a user can encounter this issue.\r\n\r\nThe most common culprit is due to the iOS Simulator that ships with Xcode 9 which allows multiple simulators to run at the same time, so it's possible to build your Titanium app and run it in one simulator, then build it again and run it in a different simulator and that's when you run into the port conflict. You can simply close the other simulator or kill the app by double pressing the home button and swiping the app away.\r\n\r\nIf you have 2 separate apps and run into this issue, then it's possible because the app id's are not unique or they just happen to hash to the same port number. Titanium will pick a port number based on the app id. This allows the Titanium app to be killed in the simulator and relaunched and the CLI should reconnect and display log messages.",

					"body": "Regarding the test app -- I'm still working on that.\r\n\r\nRegarding Chris Barber's comment, I do get that that is what the error is supposed to indicate. My point is that I got that error even though that wasn't the issue. I did not have multiple simulator/apps running at the same time and spent a lot of time fishing for the process that was using that port (even though there wasn't one). I had to dig into the sdk code and log out the actual error, which turned out to be that it did not recognize localhost as a legitimate host, because it had accidentally been removed from my `/etc/hosts` file. \r\n\r\nThe ticket request is to have the error at least log out the error generated by `net.createServer()`. Currently it just assumes that there's an error because you have another process such as another simulator using that port already.",
