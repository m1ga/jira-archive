		"description": "Here is another crazy idea: Looking at the Vue docs, they manage all their docs from Github already. Once a new doc change is made, it is published to their web docs. Couldn't we do the same? We have all docs available on Github and have proper linting and validation running. The \"only\" myth is how to publish the docs (probably from Jenkins) to our web docs. Thinking even bigger, we could do the same for our module docs that are currently pulled down manually each time the docs are made (Facebook, Map, NFC, URLSession, ..).",

It might cause more of a hassle when making PRs that need to touch documentation but personally I don't see that actually being an issue long term.\r\n\r\nI think we'd be able to more easily promote contributions if the repo was more dedicated to the documentation, we'd avoid CI failures and churn related to the living in the SDK that might turn people away from making contributions, my purely subjective opinion there. We could potentially long term, remove the wiki aspect of the documentation and have a single place (and account) for people to edit problems they view in the docs.\r\n\r\nHappy to discuss this more as it's a thought I've been kicking around for a while.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince I went off tangent, contributing back to the main purpose, Ben set up a 'CI' build of the docs that was using Jenkins and publishing to GitHub pages but it's now unmaintained, we might be able to bring it back alive easily? https://github.com/appcelerator/appc-docs",
