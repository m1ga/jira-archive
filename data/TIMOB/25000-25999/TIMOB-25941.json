		"description": "Performance of HTTP Client on Android is rather sub-par when compared to how it performs on iOS. Speed and responsiveness is just not there and has never been. It also seems to be hard on resources that can really slow down the performance of the phone/app as a whole when there are multiple HTTP requests happening at once or in succession. \r\n\r\nHere is a basic bit of code that just does a download of a 100 Mb file and shows the speed of the download and time. In the image attached you can see the performance difference between a iPhone and Android phone running the same app. The android phone is more the capable of the same download speed as the iPhone is showing, when using react or when creating a web view to do the same thing I can get over 150 Mbps on the Android phone. \r\n\r\nSample code:\r\n\r\n{code:java}\r\nvar xhr = null;\r\n\r\nvar win = Ti.UI.createWindow({\r\n  backgroundColor: '#fff',\r\n  fullscreen: false, navBarHidden: true, exitOnClose: true, theme: \"Theme.materialTheme\", orientationModes: [Titanium.UI.PORTRAIT]\r\n});\r\n \r\nvar runTime = Ti.UI.createLabel({\r\n  text: 'Run Time...',\r\n  top: 50,\r\n  left: 10,\r\n  color: '#000'\r\n});\r\n\r\nvar downloadSpeed = Ti.UI.createLabel({\r\n  text: '0.00 Mbps',\r\n  top: 90,\r\n  left: 10,\r\n  color: '#000'\r\n});\r\n\r\n \r\nvar buttonStart = Ti.UI.createButton({ title: \"START\", width: 100, height: 40, top: '45%', left: '10%' });\r\nvar buttonStop = Ti.UI.createButton({ title: \"STOP\", width: 100, height: 40, top: '45%', right: '10%' });\r\n\r\n\r\nbuttonStart.addEventListener(\"click\", function() {\r\n\r\n  var startTime = new Date().getTime();\r\n  var totalPercent = 0;\r\n\r\n  xhr = Titanium.Network.createHTTPClient({\r\n    ondatastream: function(e) {\r\n      totalPercent = (e.progress).toFixed(2);\r\n      var currentTime = new Date().getTime();\r\n      var timeDiff = ((currentTime-startTime)/1000).toFixed(2);\r\n      var totalDownloaded = (102400 * totalPercent);\r\n      var currentKBPS = (((((totalDownloaded * 1024) * 8.192) / timeDiff) / 1024 / 1024)).toFixed(2);\r\n\r\n      runTime.text = timeDiff;\r\n      downloadSpeed.text = currentKBPS + ' Mbps';\r\n    },\r\n    onload: function() {\r\n      alert('All Finished!');\r\n    },\r\n    timeout: 10000\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  xhr.open('GET','http://mirror.lstn.net/st/test100.zip');\r\n  xhr.send();\r\n\r\n});\r\n\r\n\r\nbuttonStop.addEventListener(\"click\", function() {\r\n  xhr.abort();\r\n});\r\n\r\n\r\nwin.add(runTime);\r\nwin.add(downloadSpeed);\r\nwin.add(buttonStart);\r\nwin.add(buttonStop);\r\nwin.open();\r\n{code}",

Can you try a speedtest app / speedcheck app on both devices to see what throughput you're getting?\r\n\r\nMy concern is that these are two different devices on a network -- and whilst they should both be fast, it's not a great test because one could (for some reason) be accessing the network more slowly.\r\n\r\nHave you tried running simulator and emulator on the *same* host machine -- so both are piggy backing the same wifi / hard-wired connection. Obviously they'd be some differences still between emulator / simulator etc, but the network connection should be the same for both so might be a better test.\r\n",

					"body": "Jason, \r\n\r\nYes it is consistently slower.  I attached another screen shot showing both devices after running a speed test. The Android phone is a Ti app with the speed test taken in a web view. One after the other the test was not performed at the same time. \r\n\r\nIn this case they are both using 802.11ac using the same wifi and the Android phone is not some old slow phone. With no other apps running in the background.  \r\n\r\nIts not just this device, it doesn't matter what Android device I use I have had this issue since the first day I have used Ti. I have 7 Android phones on my desk right now running all different versions of Android. I also run my own speed test app and I can tell you that this has been a problem for a very long time. The Android HTTPClient just doesn't perform well. \r\n\r\nIt doesn't matter if its running in the emulator or simulator what phone I'm using, the same code on Android will always be many times slower then the same on iOS.  \r\n\r\nIf I run multiple HTTPClients at once to do a threaded test the issue is magnified many times over. \r\n\r\nIt's also not like we are talking a 5 or 10 Mbps difference here, its a 100+ Mbps difference just on that single threaded test. \r\n\r\n!IMG_1281.jpg|thumbnail!

It happens on everything from a LG G2 all the way to a Samsung Galaxy S8 and Google Pixel 2 XL. It happens on all. \r\n\r\nAnd the problem gets magnified as you run multiple threads as I'm trying to do. *Your also not going fast enough to see the problem.* You should be much faster than 40 - 50 Mbps, especially if a speed test shows your internet speed as 200 Mbps. Please change the 100 mb download file its using to the closest one to you from the list here to eliminate any routing/distance factors of download speed : https://www.linode.com/speedtest\r\n\r\nIt doesn't matter if its in emulator/simulator or on device I get the same poor performance on android no matter what device vs iOS. An example right now that I just did, I get from the Linode Atlanta test file over 300 Mbps from a single stream on a iPhone X and around 140 on a Galaxy S8 or Pixel 2 XL. Both of those phones should be as fast or faster because of there better antenna design. And if I build with React or do a simple web view I get the same performance as the iPhone X I build with TI and its half. If I add multiple threads the problem gets worse as you take more tests. \r\n",
