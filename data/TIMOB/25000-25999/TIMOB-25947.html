<h3>Description</h3>

One major task resulting of TIMOB-25927 is that we want the framework to be added as a target dependency of the main Xcode project. This is possible via Xcode > Build Phases > Target Dependencies. The problem is that we cannot just generate a .framework that works will all configurations. 

Precompiler flags like IS_XCODE_XXX or USE_TI_XXX are necessary in situations where we want to rip out portions of the SDK for unsupported Xcode versions and unused API's, primarily to save file size and prevent apps from being rejected from the App Store. 

Thats why the CLI has to detect certain project changes and trigger a new build if necessary. In theory, this could already be done by Xcode, detecting changes in the framework and recompiling its parts automatically. But this should be validated, so we can ensure the build pipeline is not broken for recurring and clean builds.
