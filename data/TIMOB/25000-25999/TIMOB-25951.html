   [~topener], I remember [~gmathews] resolved this in 7.2.1. See here...
   <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/10197" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/10197</a>
   
   There were also 2 hyperloop regressions that were resolved in 7.3.1.
   See [TIMOB-26328] and [TIMOB-26329].
   
   So, would you mind re-testing with 7.3.1 please? I suspect we're fine now.

   I'm getting no errors on 7.3.1 with HL 3.1.2. This issue can be resolved indeed. Thanks [~jquick] & [~gmathews]</li>
