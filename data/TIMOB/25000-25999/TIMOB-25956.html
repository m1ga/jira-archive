   Hello [~designbymind] , Thanks for sharing with us. Please create a full reproducible test code and provide here for us to test the issue. Thanks.</li>

   Hi @mrahman
   
   I'll have some time this coming weekend to submit more. However, all this took was including the Hyperloop module in tiapp.xml like so: <code>&lt;module platform="iphone" version="3.1.0"&gt;hyperloop&lt;/module&gt;</code>
   - That should reproduce the error
   
   Thank you!</li>

   [~designbymind] I just compiled an app with TiSDK 7.2.0, Alloy 1.12.0 and Hyperloop 3.1.0 beta 2, and I get no errors. 
   
   So please indeed do attach a reproducible case! </li>

   Hi @Rene Pot
   
   That’s a good thing! In this case, I’ll make some time tomorrow evening. Quick question: are you pulling in any Hyperloop modules or Pods or just running the stack without actual use/reference to Hyperloop? Also device of simulator (I only tried device). I have yet to try a ‘dry run’ (without refrences/JBCharts) but I will do so to see what happens, & report back. Thank you for looking into this!</li>

   [~designbymind] no pod files/frameworks and on a simulator. Please keep me posted indeed. Without sample I cannot try to reproduce ;)</li>

   Hi @Rene Pot,
   
   Have you tried building the above with Appcelerator’s toolbar plugin for Atom IDE?
   This one: <a href="https://atom.io/packages/appcelerator-titanium" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://atom.io/packages/appcelerator-titanium</a></li>

   [~designbymind] looks like this one slipped through the cracks. Did you manage to resolve it in the meantime?</li>

   Hey @rpot — I didn't investigate any further since the HL version used was in beta. Then, I got pulled into a Vue project, so I put my app on hold. Then I came back to it & started using HL version 3.2.0b1 which builds just fine on sim but errors out on build for device. Hans has confirmed and made note to fix in HL 3.2.0b2, so that's cool! — I wish I had more info for you but that's all I got. Thanks for following up man =]</li>
