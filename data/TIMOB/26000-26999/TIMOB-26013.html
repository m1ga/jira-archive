<h3>Description</h3>

For now, if we set value to textArea by coding, the cursor will go to the end of the text value. But if the content is more than the height of the text area, you will  have to scroll up to read the top content. This is very inconvenience. Specially, when customer just want to make the textArea as a read only area. 

We should consider with the following improvement. Like if editable property is false, then the curser should go to the beginning of content. If editable property is true, we keep the current behaviour.

   I am afraid this is the native behavior. What we could propose is using <code>textArea.setSelection(0, 0)</code> which "selects" the text from position  0 to position 0, setting the cursor to the beginning.</li>

   Closing as "not our bug". If you disagree, please reopen.</li>
