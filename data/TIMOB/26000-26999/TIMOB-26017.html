   The native <code>UIMenuController</code> API behind the <code>Ti.UI.iOS.MenuPopup</code> does not include any styling options natively, so there is nothing we could expose there, see [this discussion](<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/5466818/5537752)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://stackoverflow.com/a/5466818/5537752)</a> for reference. And that is by design, because the API is meant to display a system menu people expect to have a certain style, although I would agree it would be good to have it customizable.
   
   As a workaround, you could create an own tooltip that can be positioned based on the x- and y- coordinates of the parent view.</li>
