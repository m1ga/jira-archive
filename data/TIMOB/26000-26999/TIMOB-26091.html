<h3>Description</h3>

*Issue Description:*
I have an app where I am getting out of memory errors when 
trying to scale down an image on Android. It doesn't happen every 
single time, but more times than not. What I am doing is taking the picture and then I want to resize it and upload it to a server using *ti.imagefactory.*

   [~morahman] This slightly reworked sample should get rid of the memory leak:
   <a href="https://gist.github.com/ypbnv/066245e8a5b4fc4c293a3df60e6c652c" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://gist.github.com/ypbnv/066245e8a5b4fc4c293a3df60e6c652c</a>
   
   Using directly <code>e.media</code> as a TiBlob to be passed as parameters for <code>setImage</code>, <code>ImageFactory.imageAsResized</code> and calculating reduced dimensions has the same result and goes easier on the memory allocation. 
   Another thing that I noticed is that here:
   <a href="https://gist.github.com/MotiurRahman/f5f2392af6f010d22c0d199fa9545124#file-app-js-L74" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://gist.github.com/MotiurRahman/f5f2392af6f010d22c0d199fa9545124#file-app-js-L74</a>
   The parameter passed for the <code>remove</code> method on both ImageViews is an instance of TiBlob, but it expects an instance of TiView.
   
   As for the memory leak itself - I don't think it is specific for the ImageFactory module. I was able to reproduce it without the module at all. Allocating multiple big chunks of memory in the <code>success</code> callback of <code>showCamera</code> seems to be the culprit. Doing the same work outside the callback works just fine, so I would recommend more complex usage of the camera result to be done outside the callback's context.</li>

   Thank you so much.  Those changes and suggestions worked great for me.  </li>

   We have a work in progress about improving memory management with images. Once it is ready this ticket's test case will be tested once again for possible leaks.</li>
