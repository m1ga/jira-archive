<h3>Description</h3>

Since installing Xcode 9.4, the command line "appc info" incorrectly reports iOS simulator information.  Specifically, the 11.3 simulators are each listed twice, once with the correct UDID and once with the UDID of the of the 11.4 simulator.  This causes things like the Atom appcelerator-titanium package and third party tools like the TiNy utility to not function properly.

   It's possible that Xcode recreated duplicate simulators when the newer version was installed. I've seen this happen to my machine before.
   
   As a fix, I created the following script: <a href="https://gist.github.com/cb1kenobi/19dc4c547864a96bfa9027aae5631e67." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://gist.github.com/cb1kenobi/19dc4c547864a96bfa9027aae5631e67.</a> Simply save it to a file and run <code>node &lt;script&gt;</code>. It blows away all of your simulators and recreates them.
   
   Otherwise, I have not been been able to reproduce it on my machine. Can I get a sample of the appc info output please?</li>

   I ran your fix.  It did a nice renaming of the simulators but the "duplicates" still appear.  I have this issue on both machines that I use (at work and at home).  I'm attaching the output of the "apps info" command.  What I found since I reported this issue was that in the simulator.js file in the node module ioslib that ships with each SDK version, there is a section of coding (beginning at line 203 for SDK version 7.2.0.GA, that intentionally adds the entries because apparently a single runtime  can be associated with multiple iOS version.  So while there there have been, or is still, a reason for this, other tools such as the Atom package are at best confusing.  It will show the iPhone X for 11.3 for both 11.3 and 11.4 but selecting the 11.4 version causes the UI to indicate you selected the iPhone X for 11.4 because under the covers the UDIDs are the same for both versions.  I am also attaching a screen shot of Atom as well as the output from "appc info" with the single line (line 218 at 7.2.0.GA) commented out.  Ok, maybe I'm missing something or maybe I don't have authority to add attachments, so I created a GitHub repo with the attachments I mention at [<a href="https://github.com/MarkBoyer/TIMOB-26105" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/MarkBoyer/TIMOB-26105</a>](<a href="https://github.com/MarkBoyer/TIMOB-26105)." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/MarkBoyer/TIMOB-26105).</a>
