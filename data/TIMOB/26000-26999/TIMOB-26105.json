Simply save it to a file and run {{node <script>}}. It blows away all of your simulators and recreates them.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, I have not been been able to reproduce it on my machine.

					"body": "I ran your fix.  It did a nice renaming of the simulators but the \"duplicates\" still appear.  I have this issue on both machines that I use (at work and at home).  I'm attaching the output of the \"apps info\" command.  What I found since I reported this issue was that in the simulator.js file in the node module ioslib that ships with each SDK version, there is a section of coding (beginning at line 203 for SDK version 7.2.0.GA, that intentionally adds the entries because apparently a single runtime  can be associated with multiple iOS version.  So while there there have been, or is still, a reason for this, other tools such as the Atom package are at best confusing.  It will show the iPhone X for 11.3 for both 11.3 and 11.4 but selecting the 11.4 version causes the UI to indicate you selected the iPhone X for 11.4 because under the covers the UDIDs are the same for both versions.  I am also attaching a screen shot of Atom as well as the output from \"appc info\" with the single line (line 218 at 7.2.0.GA) commented out.  Ok, maybe I'm missing something or maybe I don't have authority to add attachments, so I created a GitHub repo with the attachments I mention at [https://github.com/MarkBoyer/TIMOB-26105|https://github.com/MarkBoyer/TIMOB-26105].\r\n",
