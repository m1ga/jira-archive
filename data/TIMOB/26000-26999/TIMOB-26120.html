<h3>Description</h3>

We have a number of security vulnerabilities now listed by default on npm installs (as of npm 6 this is built into the process). We should try to update all of our npm package dependencies as much as possible, as well as attempt to drive down the security vulnerabilities listed as low as possible (ideally none).

This has knock-on effects on all of the npm packages we generate and dependencies upon in the SDK, so this will include fixes for things like node-appc, ioslib, windowslib, appc-aar-tools, etc.
