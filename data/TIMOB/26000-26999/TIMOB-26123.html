<h3>Description</h3>

It is time to move to iOS 9 as our minimum target. It's a move not only done by us but all major frameworks and it should be used to also clean up the conditional-statements inside the core. Moving to the iOS 9 target also uncovers 150+ warnings that need to be resolved. Most of them are around Ti.Contacts, which luckily is iOS 9 compatible already, but still has some references to the deprecated "AddressBook" framework that needs to be ripped out.
