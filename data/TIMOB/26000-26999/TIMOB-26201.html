<h3>Description</h3>

There are many API's (321 in total) that are currently deprecated in the SDK. All API's that have been deprecated before 5.x (e.g. 3.2, 4.0 etc) should go away these days. Some major examples:

- Titanium.Android.Calendar -> Ti.Calendar (since 3.2.0)
- PENDING_INTENT_FOR_* (since 2.0.0)
- Android geolocation legacy mode (since 2.0.0)
- Ti.Network.SOCKET_* (since 1.7.0)

We could likely save a good amount of compile time for both docs-gen and the SDK itself by removing this.

(Edit by Hans: Renamed the ticket to handle all deprecations, not just Ti.Calendar.Event).

   [~cwilliams] Are you okay with removing them all together? Any design thoughts on the upper limit of removal? Everything < SDK 5.0? Or <= SDK 5.0?</li>
<li>Ewan Harris 2018-07-11

   Apologies for butting in, but I think we're fine to remove anything that's been deprecated since before the last major (so 7.0 for 8.0) based off <a href="https://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#</a>!/guide/Axway_Appcelerator_Deprecation_Policy ?</li>

   If everyone agrees on that, sure! I'd love to rip it all out.</li>

   Ready for review. [~kiguchi] Do we have Windows API's that have been deprecated in <= 7.0.0? Then we should clone this for Windows and clean up there as well.</li>

   Thanks for heads up, created TIMOB-26236 to track this for Windows.</li>

   This was kind of an ongoing effort across multiple PRs:
   - <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/11368" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/11368</a>
   - <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/11386" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/11386</a>
   - <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/11362" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/11362</a>
   
   The individual PRs list the removals and updated the docs.
   
   I likely will not get absolutely every pre-7.0.0 API done in time for 9.0.0 release. But I've whittled it down considerably.</li>
<li>Christopher Williams 2019-12-16

   Note also that I created a package.json script to report the APIs that have been long-deprecated but not yet marked removed: <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/11366" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/11366</a>
   
   So gathering the future listings of what to double-check and remove should be easier.</li>

   Closing ticket, verified code changes in SDK version 9.0.0.v20200211122336.</li>
