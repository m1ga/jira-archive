<h3>Description</h3>

Our Android setup is broken. Since the latest Android Studio update, I cannot see any emulators anymore and "ti info" is giving the following:
<code><pre>
NOTE: The following Android information has been determined using deprecated detection logic. To
display more accurate information, install and select a Titanium SDK 3.2 or newer.

Android SDK
  Android Executable          = /opt/android-sdk/tools/android
  SDK Path                    = /opt/android-sdk

Android NDK
  NDK Path                    = not found
  NDK Version                 = not found

Android Platforms
  None

Android Add-Ons
  None

Android AVDs
  None

Issues
  No issues detected! Your development environment should be working perfectly!
</pre></code>
Not only is the note about "upgrading to Ti SDK 3.2" incorrect, outdated and confusing, but also the CLI thinks there are no issues although obviously no Android platform can be detected properly.

   Resolving as per note from [~eharris]. The issue was that I selected a custom SDK 8.0.0 that does not have the Android part of the SDK installed. We could improve the output for that, but that looks very dev-specific and edgy, so no worries here. Thank you [~eharris]!</li>

   similar thing happened to me, I had to switch to another sdk (8.2.0.GA) and it started working again. Not sure why it doesn't work with a newer version (8.3.0.GA). Thanks Hans!</li>
