<h3>Description</h3>

Android P introduces some [behavior changes](<a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/pie/android-9.0-changes-all#privacy-changes-all)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://developer.android.com/about/versions/pie/android-9.0-changes-all#privacy-changes-all)</a> of which some also effect apps not targeting Android P but running on them. In detail, there are privacy changes that for example disallow the microphone or camera to be used from the background. We should investigate if this affects our apps as well.

   I'm pretty sure supporting these features in the background requires a foreground service which was implemented in 7.3.0. But we should double-check what the behavior actually is and document it.</li>

   I've confirmed that we can still use GPS while app is in the background if using a foreground service.
   
   Also, gyroscope and accelerometer sensors still work on Android P as well... although an app developer should always turn these sensors off while backgrounded. Titanium orientation event handling already internally turns it off when suspended and re-enables the orientation sensors when the app is resumed. We're good.</li>
