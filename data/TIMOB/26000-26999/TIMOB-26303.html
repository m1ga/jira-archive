<h3>Description</h3>

After the new Api of CookieManager on android, when you use a webview using a local html file on url config, you can't access cookies that were created on the app, even if you use the Titanium.Network.addSystemCookie.
For that, you need to allow third party cookies on webview. The problem is Titanium doesn't support that.
It's important to have a config to allow that.

   I have a PR that add this option.
   The problem is that I submitted on another issue (a issue that has a bug).
   How to I add this PR on this issue too?</li>

   [~zaedyjava] Then we should link the PR to the existing ticket instead of this new one I assume?</li>

   Honestly, I don't think so.
   I think that are two things that co-exists.
   
   The other issue is a bug.
   The problem reported on the other issue should work without this config created. But with the CookieManager API that is used, as I see, it's simple not possible.
   Because of that, I've created the new config of webview. The problem is that I can't make this config true as default, because it will impact in other webview's uses.
   I've created this issue to explicit make this know as a new feature (maybe on release notes?).
   
   I don't know how is the process when you have a PR that could impact on more than one issue...
   But if you think that just resolve the other issue is enough, ok for me =)</li>
