<h3>Description</h3>

Related to TIMOB-26109, Xcode cannot find the header-source-paths used before (e.g. <code>#import "TiApp.h"</code>) from <code>~/Library/Application Support/Titanium/mobilesdk/osx/7.3.0.GA/iphone/include/</code> anymore. While building the module works fine, building the library from Xcode, for example to debug the development process, does not work anymore. The radar is [rdar://40906817](<a href="http://www.openradar.me/40906817)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.openradar.me/40906817)</a> and it's still open after 2 months of iOS 12 / Xcode 10 Beta testing.

For our current module architecture, this is fundamental. For our new Swift support and framework-based modules, this will not be an issue anymore, but all existing modules will still be affected by it. 

As a workaround, the developer can go to <code>File &gt; Project Settings</code> and select the "Legacy Build System" which does not has this issue.

   Putting ticket on hold and putting it as a known issue with Xcode 10. The workaround can be found above and should also be mentioned in the announcements + release notes (cc [~amukherjee] [~bimmel])</li>
