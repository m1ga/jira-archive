					"body": "If someone is running into a performance issue, then it's likely something very specific. A \"nebulous\" ticket like this isn't very helpful.\r\n\r\nFor example, if the APK is multidexed, then it will have a slow startup time on Android 4.x since OS versions older than 5.0 do not support multidexed apps. This means on Android 4.x, the app has to load the multiple dex libraries on app startup via software which is a long blocking operation. We can't fix that. You can only avoid it by either reducing the number of JARs or setting the min supported OS version to 5.0.\r\n\r\nAnother example is image loading is blocking for all APIs other than {{ImageView.image}} on both Android and iOS. Such as \"backgroundImage\". If you use \"backgroundImage\" a lot, then consider using an {{ImageView}} instead for async image loading.\r\n\r\nAnd we're making optimizations all the time. We've optimized internal APK file access in 7.5.0. And we've added an async version of {{WebView.evalJS()}} in 8.0.0.\r\n\r\nDo you have anything specific you want to share with us?",
