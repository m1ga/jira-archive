		"description": "The Galaxy S9 (and Note 9) is similar to the iPhone X in that the display curves at each corner.\r\n\r\nThe display resolution is 2960 but DisplayCaps.platformHeight returns 2768.  We think this is delineating the \"safe area\" for display.  It is possible that the native Display.getRealSize might actually return 2960 but we haven't tried this.  This is if you \"Tap here to fill entire screen\" which hides the bottom bar containing the home and back buttons and expands the app to full screen.\r\n\r\nIf you create a Window with no dimensions specified, you do get a full height 2960 window.  But this is where the problems begin - if you then try to place items on this Window, since platformHeight reports 2768, you are going to have problems with layout.  The full screen screenshot shows this problem - because we don't know that we are on a 2960 screen, the display elements aren't scaled correctly so there is a gap at the bottom.\r\n\r\nIf you create the Window with property height 2768, it does center it in the display but now you've got the black bands above and below (the 2768 screenshot does not capture the rounded area - the actual black bands are much bigger) and you might as well be on an S8 since you aren't taking full advantage of the display\r\n\r\nThe problem, just as it was for the iPhone X, is to detect that we've got a Galaxy S9, Note 9 or similar phone with this feature.\r\n\r\nWe would like to be able to use the full display but because we can't determine whether one not we've got this situation, the workaround is to just use the platformHeight for the Window height and live with the black bands.\r\n\r\nBTW, there is no Galaxy S9 emulator in Genymotion so you'll have to go find someone with a phone and see for yourself.\r\n\r\nTest code is trivial - just createWindow with no dimension and then place a label with bottom at platformHeight and you'll see that it is not at the bottom of the window.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

This is a good thing because it prevents the notch from overlapping your app's content.\r\n\r\nAs [~hknoechel] has mentioned, we plan on targeting Android P in Titanium 7.5.0. By then, your app will be able to take full advantage of the screen and we'll provide access to a new API {{Window.extendSafeArea}} that'll allow you to optionally control if the window will extend under the notch like iOS.\r\n\r\nAll in due time.

					"body": "Okay. Right, I think we are talking about 2 different things.\r\nI'm going to remove the Android P label from this ticket, because it has nothing to do with notch handling.\r\n\r\nTitanium's {{DisplayCaps.platformHeight}} on Android does not return the height of the screen. It returns the \"visible\" height of the app window and titlebar relative to the app's orientation (not device orientation). It does not include the height of the top status bar and bottom navigation bar (ie: the system decor) unless they've been set up to be translucent. This is by Google's design. If it were to return the actual screen height, then it would be a problem for split-screen mode apps.\r\nhttps://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/Display.html#getMetrics(android.util.DisplayMetrics)\r\n\r\nNow, if the behavior you're seeing doesn't match the above description, then you might be running into a bug on the Samsung device. Samsung does make their own fork of the Android OS after-all and bugs on their end have been known to happen. We have a Nexus 6P which has rounded corners (made by Huawei, not Samsung). I don't recall our Nexus 6P having the issues you've mentioned, but we can re-test it later this week.\r\n\r\nI do suspect this may be a bug on Samsung's end and a work-around would have to be found. Such as a different window setting/theme that doesn't have this issue. Unfortunately, Android is the wild-west of operating systems and not all devices follow the rules so-to-speak.",

					"body": "Let me make a suggestion here.\r\n\r\nDon't use {{displayCaps}} to layout your UI.\r\n\r\nThe reason is because your UI will be constrained to the bounds of the {{Window}}. This is your UI container. The device/OS controls whether or not your window completely fills the screen/display and you want to avoid making false assumptions. The window's dimensions correctly resizes/positions itself for all screen decorations such as the status bar, nav bar, copy/paste clipboard bar, insets/notches, etc. It would be best to leverage this.\r\n\r\nWe'll re-test it to see if {{displayCaps}} is shorter than the window height. If so, we'll write it up as a separate ticket since this ticket is causing confusion amongst the team here (which is why it was being ignored). Having a short concise issue description is key to getting quicker results.\r\n\r\nAlso, I should repeat that you should *never* use {{displayCaps}} for layout purposes. Personally, the native equivalent on Android isn't that useful either. The only useful thing I've used it for natively on Android is identify if my app is being shown \"portrait\" while the device is held \"landscape\" in split-screen mode... and vice-versa.",

					"body": "We have one Samsung device with rounded corners, but it never letterboxes the app. Nor does the device give us any insets natively to calculate a safe-area.\r\nI don't think all devices follow the rules so-to-speak.\r\n\r\nWould you mind doing a quick test for me please? Run the below using 7.5.0 on your device and tell me what the results are.\r\n{code:javascript}\r\nvar window = Ti.UI.createWindow({\r\n\textendSafeArea: true,\r\n\tfullscreen: true,\r\n\ttheme: \"Theme.AppCompat.NoTitleBar\",\r\n\twindowFlags: Ti.UI.Android.FLAG_TRANSLUCENT_STATUS | Ti.UI.Android.FLAG_TRANSLUCENT_NAVIGATION,\r\n});\r\nwindow.addEventListener(\"postlayout\", function() {\r\n\tTi.API.info(\"### safeAreaPadding: \" + JSON.stringify(window.safeAreaPadding));\r\n\tTi.API.info(\"### windowSize: \" + JSON.stringify(window.size));\r\n\tTi.API.info(\"### displayCaps.height: \" + JSON.stringify(Ti.Platform.displayCaps.platformHeight));\r\n});\r\nwindow.open();\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nOur new 7.5.0 \"safeAreaPadding\" will provide the system insets relative to the window. These are the insets reported to us by the OS.\r\n\r\nAlso, I do know that an Android P device with notches will still letterbox an app set up for fullscreen mode... unless you set the translucent flags as shown above. So, even if you hide the top status bar, it'll still letterbox it unless you also set up the top status bar as translucent too, even though it's not there. It's one of those Android quirks/gotchas that you have to watch out for. In 7.5.0, we've modified our internal code to set this translucent flag automatically for you for fullscreen apps as can be seen here...\r\nhttps://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/10383/files#diff-034a9360d01584987d9c951c0a215f65R544\r\n\r\nI'm curious if you're being burned by the same translucent flag issue. I know your device wasn't Android P before, but it could be a similar issue. If you're not willing to upgrade to 7.5.0 yet, then you can set this flag manually as shown below...\r\n{code:javascript}\r\nvar FLAG_TRANSLUCENT_STATUS = 67108864;\r\nvar window = Ti.UI.createWindow({\r\n\tfullscreen: true,\r\n\ttheme: \"Theme.AppCompat.NoTitleBar\",\r\n\twindowFlags: FLAG_TRANSLUCENT_STATUS,\r\n});\r\n{code}\r\n",
