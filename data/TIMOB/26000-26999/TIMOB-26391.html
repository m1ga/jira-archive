<h3>Description</h3>

Hi there,
before Apple's event on September 12th we've decided to test our apps on iOS 12 beta and everything seems to work fine
except that the app freezes randomly on different parts of it. It could be writing some data on the database or downloading images from web.
We then have tried to isolate and make a test case where it always freezes but we could not find it.
But what we've found so far is that it always freezes when:

"run-on-main-thread" is set to true. Never freezes when this is disabled
Running on iOS 12. Everything is fine on iOS 11
Running with Ti SDK - 7.1.0.GA and latest release 7.4.0.RC
Building from both Xcode 9 and 10. This also happens on iOS 12 simulators

We also tried checking Instruments and Console to see if we can find some errors before it freezes but nothing weird
is displayed on them nor a memory warning/leak.

The biggest challenge here is to find a very isolated and reproducible case where it will always freeze.
We found another community member with the same problem but maybe not so many members have iOS beta versions installed on their devices.

   I think Carlos is mentioning me in the description and face the same problem. I'd like to drill down on this problem, but have no pointers where to start as it's occurring completely random. As mentioned it's occurring on both the simulators and real devices.</li>
<li>Hans Knöchel 2018-09-11

   Do you use specific setTimeout or setInterval API's? Maybe there is a deadlock when using those. I am trying my best to troubleshoot this together with you guys. Thanks!</li>
<li>Jeroen van Dijk 2018-09-11

   I don't exactly understand what you mean with API's in the context of setTimeout & setInterval, but I'm not using that kind of logic when bridging from Javascript to Native. What I'm doing though is using _.defer() a lot based on the knowledge shared by Ronald Treur: <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/ronaldtreur/titanium-making-the-most-of-your-single-thread" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.slideshare.net/ronaldtreur/titanium-making-the-most-of-your-single-thread</a></li>
<li>Nick Kemp 2018-09-12

   Just to chime in, we are also seeing this issue on iOS 12. Its very random in frequency but in our case it appears to happen only when the app resumes from the background. In the Resumed event we are using a _.defer(). The deferred function is checking for Geofence permission and starting/stopping and based on that loading geofences or not.
   
   Update: removed _.defer, no change.

   I have the same issue with an application in production. it freezes each second time when window with ti.map is opened. 
   
   I'm gong to re-test app with "run-on-main-thread" is set to false and don't have any ideas what to do next. Please help.</li>
<li>Leonardo Farias 2018-09-14

   Also having the same issue. Its very difficult to isolate on a production app, due to the multiple dependencies, also there is nothing in the logs, or anything. It seems that its a black box error, so no visibility on why.</li>
<li>Carlos Henrique Zinato 2018-09-14

   For me, setting run-on-main-thread to false fixes the problem 100%. Tested with GM version of iOS 12 beta and Xcode.</li>
<li>Sergey Nosenko 2018-09-14

   I have a few things that works only with run-on-main-thread so I'm in dead lock with this issue. :(
   
   Please help...</li>
<li>Hans Knöchel 2018-09-14

   Thanks for the responses everyone! We are actively looking into this ATM. If anyone can share his/her app with me, I'd highly appreciate it. It can be sent to hknoechel@axway.com, thx! [~vijaysingh] Let me know your investigations on this one.</li>
<li>Leonardo Farias 2018-09-14

    Hans have sent you an invite to our repo on github. If you have questions please reach out to ianko or bduyng on ti.slack.</li>
<li>Nick Kemp 2018-09-15

    After a few days testing we think it is in fact related to use of setInterval. We are able to reach a no hang state by not using setInterval. 
    
    Hans, I have sent you an email and access to our repo.</li>
<li>Hans Knöchel 2018-09-15

    Thanks Nick! I am testing your project right now. We are continuing to investigate in the setInterval / setTimeout direction, since these are also JSCore based and may have changed internally in iOS 12.
    
    *EDIT*: Looking into the code, there is indeed a [difference](<a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/blob/master/iphone/Classes/KrollTimer.m#L106-L117)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/blob/master/iphone/Classes/KrollTimer.m#L106-L117)</a> between kroll- and main-thread in the timer-management, resulting in a threading issue after some time. If someone can comment out line 106-113 and let me know the results, I'd appreciate it, since I'm still not able to reproduce the bug.</li>
<li>Nick Kemp 2018-09-16

    Cheers Hans,
    
    I ran up a build with those lines commented out and have had UI hang on boot. I once got into the UI after resetting the simulator (so forcing the user to log out of the app). But once in I had a hard crash. 
    
    After that it was back to the hang on splash.</li>
<li>Hans Knöchel 2018-09-16

    Thanks Nick! We will dig into this next week.</li>
<li>Vijay Singh 2018-09-16

    I'll also look in this issue. If someone can please share your app with me at vsingh@axway.com, would be great. Thanks!</li>
<li>Nick Kemp 2018-09-16

    I've sent you an invite Vijay!</li>
<li>Vijay Singh 2018-09-17

    Thanks Nick for sharing your app! 
    I have tried to reproduce the issue with app but unable to reproduce the issue.
    Is there any particular steps to reproduce it?
    Can you please try to test it by replacing 'NO' with 'YES' at line no 111 [here](<a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/blob/master/iphone/Classes/KrollTimer.m#L111)." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/blob/master/iphone/Classes/KrollTimer.m#L111).</a> Thanks!</li>
<li>Nick Kemp 2018-09-17

    No problem, I have just sent a build out to our team tonight for testing with that change. One of the challenges has been consistency. On some devices it manifests quickly (on a test iPhone X we have running iOS 12, it occurs several times an hour) but on others (iphone7+) it can be 24hours+ of running before we see the issue.
    
    With our particular app, it only happens when you have the pill moved over to locations (on the greetings screen). This does a setInterval. With this on, it will randomly UI hang. With this slider set to manually it never hangs. </li>
<li>Nick Kemp 2018-09-18

    An update: We have been running for 2 days now, no hangs with this change!
     That flag seems to have solved it. Will keep updating if there are any changes</li>
<li>Vijay Singh 2018-09-19

    Thanks for update Nick!
    Can other people also please verify with following changes -

    I've just tested on both 7.1.0.GA and 7.4.0.RC and still the same.
    Just to make sure, I'm changing from NO to YES on KrollTimer.m line 111, cleaning my project and building it again (deleting the app).
    Tested it 3 times on different devices, always cleaning the project. Still the same =/
    I can share an .IPA file if you want it so you can see the logs if it helps</li>
<li>Hans Knöchel 2018-09-19

    Please note that your app still could crash because of other iOS 12 related deprecations or removals. For example, memory leaks in your controllers could have been ignored on iOS 11.x but may be causing a crash on iOS 12 now. We need an isolated test project to reproduce this in order to properly fix all occurences of this crash. Also, it seems like no one is able to provide a symbolicated crash report or log so far, which makes it impossible to fix.</li>
<li>Pankti Pancholi 2018-09-19

    I can send you my app on email id provided would you be able to test it on your end, For me it is crashing on only one image screen, if I don't go to that part everything is working fine</li>
<li>Greg 2018-09-19

    I've tested this too and am getting startup crashes and other freezes very frequently with ios12/7.4.X and XCode 10.  All was fine with iOS11/7.3.0/XC 9  - I will look harder to find the cause, it's a real challenge to get crash logs though as the app cannot be directly built with XCode (missing resources etc...) - This should really be possible!!.  As a workaround I create a tishadow app and because of the way it is packaged, I can rebuild that app in XCode directly and the resources are present, which gives far superior debug-ability - it does however add another variable to the mix :/</li>
<li>Nick Kemp 2018-09-19

    UPDATE: I experienced our first UI hang last night on my own device, since making the change. Massive decrease in occurrences, however the issue is still there for us.
    
    Hans: We're not seeing crashes in our app, just UI hangs, so nothing to provide as output.</li>
<li>Brian Knorr 2018-09-19

    We are getting the freezes and crashes for our apps as well using all the latest, iOS12, XCode 10, Ti 7.4.0.GA.  Our clients are getting upset.  Any progress on this?</li>
<li>Greg 2018-09-19

    Not sure if it helps, but I've obbserved that some of the crashes are related to the freeze. 
    
    e.g when the app is frozen it will generally stay alive (and not crash).  It will however crash ~180 seconds after backgrounding as the system will be unable to take a screen snapshot - presumably because the main thread is unresponsive.

    Using instruments with a patched SDK with the fix: I can see a leak from our use of setInterval. Leak stops after clearInterval.</li>
<li>Oleg Gudyno 2018-09-20

    Hi guys!
    
    Our team faced the same issues right before application launch in production. It freezes or crashes frequently without specific steps to reproduce. Setting preference to YES in KrollTimer.m unfortunately was not helpful - seems application did not freeze but crashes much frequently (in some cases it is related to TI.Database). 
    Could you please tell do you have any updates regarding these issues and when we can expect SDK update?
    
    Thanks in advance!</li>
<li>kosso 2018-09-20

    Regarding the possibility of setInterval and setTimeout being the culprit, I've been running this simple test app.js :
    
    [Gist Test app.js for TIMOB-26391](<a href="https://gist.github.com/kosso/540fdb1f24dc44152d9e6588ee57088f)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://gist.github.com/kosso/540fdb1f24dc44152d9e6588ee57088f)</a>
    
    Note:  when the app is put to the background, the setInterval pauses until the app is resumed. (Is that expected behaviour?) 
    
    However: interestingly, if I register a background service script (even an empty js file!) when the app pauses, the intervals and timeouts all work as normal while the app is in the background. 
    
    Update: In the background script, if I also add another setInterval and setTimeout similar to the ones in app.js, even though I'm stopping and unregistering the background script when the app resumes, the background setInterval and setTimeouts are still firing and logging to the console. So they're not being cleared. 
    
    And if I then go to the background again, the intervals and timeout are being duplicated. 
    
    Something is certainly wrong there. 
    
    Update2: The the invervals running in the background service do actually stop after 180 seconds, after the <code>assertiond</code> process sends "Sending background permission expiration warning!" to the log. 
    </li>
<li>Nirmal 2018-09-21

    Similar observation from our production apps.
    Random crashes in the initial sync during launching the app which is all API calls and persisting the received responses into SQLite DB.
    
    No use of setInterval in our codebase.</li>
<li>Carlos Henrique Zinato 2018-09-21

    Hey @Greg thanks for your input. I think this makes a lot of sense since some of my clients are complaining that the app is crashing much more often then before and I knew it was a side effect of keeping the run-on-main-thread FALSE. So the app is actually "freezing" but because the UI is running on a different thread, we can not notice the "freeze". Than like you've said, it will crash after ~180 seconds.
    @kosso, I'm trying your test cases but they are not freezing on iOS 12 =/ Any other idea anyone?</li>
<li>Pankti Pancholi 2018-09-21

    I don't know why they have put this issue as resolved, I am having the same issue and my App is getting crashed on one screen.. And its not resolved yet, I have tried all different options but I am not able to solve it out.
    
    </li>
<li>Carlos Henrique Zinato 2018-09-21

    It's not as resolved, it says "Unresolved" and "In Review"....let's hope they find something. Fingers crossed</li>
<li>kosso 2018-09-21

    @Carlos  The test app was to try and see if the intervals were the cause.  I was trying to speed up crash testing.  But on the way, found some interesting phenomena regarding timers on background services.  (But since the timers alone don't actually create any 'audio', 'fetch', 'location', etc. actions, the system will kill the background tasks after 180 seconds. 
    
    I still get random freezes in my apps, as described. But sometimes it can be after an hour. Sometimes after running for 12 hours. 
    
    One thing I did notice today, after testing an app overnight, is that I added the fix for Ti.App events from TIMOB-26369  and today I saw my app actually react to a 'memorywarning' event. The app did not crash, but an alert (which I had programmed in the listener) did show up. 
    
    I also spent all night re-writing some of the functionality my app needs to do on the network in to a custom native module using GCD for the tasks. This has dramatically improved performance of certain tasks (eg: lazy-loading 200+ row tableViews with remote/cached images.) But I don't think it's 100% related to this issue. 
    
    Also, a couple of people have mentioned SQLite being a potential culprit.  My app does a lot of regular SQLite work for logging etc. on a very regular basis, every 5 minutes or so, and also each few hours to generate JSON from it and POST to our servers. This all seems to have been working fine. 
    
    The 'KrollTimer.m' YES/NO fix and run thread setting doesn't seem to have made much difference.  </li>
<li>Hans Knöchel 2018-09-21

    Quick update: We are still investigating this ticket and are finally able to reproduce the issue. While doing that, we also pinpointed it down to calls with Ti.Network.HTTPClient that fire a callback which causes the crash (only when using main-thread as known already). 
    
    For an insight: [This](<a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/blob/master/iphone/Classes/KrollObject.m#L1077)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/blob/master/iphone/Classes/KrollObject.m#L1077)</a> is where it crashes exactly - the kroll- and main-thread related changes can also be seen in there. We are actively working on a fix right now and will keep this ticket updated. 
    
    To keep the ticket chronic clean, please prevent posts like "same here" and follow this ticket instead. Thank you!</li>

    This is not "the same" post. We have an application with offline mode (but with ti.googlemap module with prechased maps). it works without any HTTPClient calls but it freeze each 2-3 time when window with googlemap is opened.
    
    UPDATE: I added couple of "ENSURE_UI_THREAD" to ti.googlemap and we published new version with run-on-main-thread: false. Now it works so we can wait for fix. 
    
    Unfortunately, I can't share the app. :(
    
    Good luck with investigation and I'm ready to help with testing - contact me as @darknos at ti-slack if need.</li>

    Greetings,
    
    I have been able to successfully work-around this bug by doing the following things:
    - Change my background task spawned inside of index.js from using setInterval to using setTimeout+Recursion to keep running.
    - Change my SDK from the GA release to "*7.4.1.v20180920040600*".
    
    setInterval appears to be the problem for me. By implementing the two things above, I'm running almost 100% stable now on iOS12 from my testing so far. I am able to leave <code>run-on-main-thread</code> enabled in this configuration, meaning Hyperloop still works for me.</li>
<li>kosso 2018-09-24

    @Josh. I'm currently looking at forking and updating a native timer module to replace (or provide some parity to) setInterval and setTimeout here> <a href="https://github.com/kosso/ti.mely" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/kosso/ti.mely</a>
    
    Having tried the run-on-main-thread options and other possible fixes above, I've still had an app lock up. 
    
    Sometimes, it has locked up around a time in my app 'near' where I make 'heavy' use of setInterval (to crossfade two audio players). Sometimes the lockup happens after a couple of hours. Sometimes, many more. But often around the same point in my app's processes where setInterval is employed.

<li>Carlos Henrique Zinato 2018-09-24

    @Josh this didn't fix my app. Doesn't seem to be something in one place like HTTP or interval, maybe a bunch of things combined. My app also freezes when the phone is on Airplane mode =/
    @kosso nice work with these native intervals/timeout! Hope you can progress on that!
    (why JIRA's user mention tool is so useless like this?)</li>
<li>Hans Knöchel 2018-09-24

    Quick update: We investigated this further over the weekend could get a successful result if the following flag is set in the <ios> section o the tiapp.xml:
    <code><pre>
    <use-jscore-framework>false</use-jscore-framework>
    </pre></code>
    The JSCore framework can for example be used to debug apps through Safari. While we still fixing the cause of this issue, using the above flag will fix it for now. Thanks!</li>
<li>Carlos Henrique Zinato 2018-09-24

    Awesome! Gonna test this and let you know @Hans! Do you know when use-jscore-framework started to be supported by Titanium?</li>
<li>Hans Knöchel 2018-09-24

    Supported since SDK 5, made default in 7.0.0+ (which also explains why 6.3.0 worked and 7.0.0 not). The underlaying issue is about GC'ing objects on the low-level side of the SDK. Keeping this thread updated.</li>
<li>Carlos Henrique Zinato 2018-09-24

    Exactly! That's why I've just asked...and because I just found this: "With Titanium SDK 6.x, developers must add a tag to enable the iOS debugger in order to use Safari (or iOS-webkit-debug-proxy). With SDK 7.x and later, this value is assumed to be true unless you explicitly add the tag with false as the value."
    Testing it here and let you know right away</li>
<li>kosso 2018-09-24

    @Carlos (and anyone else interested to try it) I have updated my fork of the 'ti.mely' module to include setInterval and setTimeout methods with the same structure and callbacks as the 'native' JavaScript functions. 
    
    <a href="https://github.com/kosso/ti.mely" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/kosso/ti.mely</a>  (Now with iOS and Android included)
    
    I'm thinking that maybe a native solution for timers might be a safer approach?

<li>Brian Knorr 2018-09-24

    Some more info... we have one app that uses setInterval to retrieve remote data periodically and it freezes a lot, but after setting run-on-main-thread to false, it seems to work fine.  We can do this because we do not use Hyperloop in this app.  However in one of our client's apps, we use Hyperloop so we cannot do this.  Our client's app doesn't use setInterval, and it freezes up by just making a simple network call (like logging in) and then updating the ui.  So while setTimeout and setInterval may cause this issue to happen more often, it doesn't seem to be the root cause - at least in our case.  Thanks!</li>
<li>Rene Pot 2018-09-24

    [~btknorr]
    Did you also test with the recommended property by [~hknoechel] above?
    
    <code><pre>
    <use-jscore-framework>false</use-jscore-framework>
    </pre></code></li>
<li>Carlos Henrique Zinato 2018-09-24

    Great add @Brian! Thanks for sharing.
    Just so you know, I can confirm that setting "use-jscore-framework" to false on tiapp.xml fixed the issue on iOS 12 with no other side effects. Tested on both iOS 12 and 11 and with Titanium SDK 7.1.0 and 7.4.0, the app never freezes again.
    Thanks everyone!</li>
<li>Brian Knorr 2018-09-24

    We are starting to test with this set to false right now...I will let you know.  Thanks!</li>
<li>Brian Knorr 2018-09-24

    When setting this to false the app immediately crashes on startup and we get a hyperloop warning that we should set use-jscore-framework to true.  So this unfortunately is not a fix for hyperloop apps.</li>
<li>Fabian Martinez 2018-09-24

    *EDIT Sep 25*:
    setting the property <code><pre><use-jscore-framework>false</use-jscore-framework></pre></code> seems to work fine! The app is not crashing now.
    My problem after setting this property was that ES6 was not supported anymore.
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------
    *ORIGINAL POST:*
    I'm not experiencing freezings but crashes with iOS 12 (iPhoneX device) and Ti SDK 7.4.0.GA.
    Everything was smooth on iOS 11 and Ti SDK 7.3.1.GA.
    Changing this property flag <code><pre><use-jscore-framework>false</use-jscore-framework></pre></code>  to false didn't make a difference.
    
    This app uses joli.js library as adapter for the models. I could isolate the crash to always the same line, but it's totally random, sometimes I can add like 20 items to a listview and to the model and it works fine, sometimes it crashes after 3 or 9... no special conditions are met for the crash.
    
    This line <code><pre>var db = Titanium.Database.open('dbname');</pre></code> returns a database object almost all of the times, so <code><pre>db.execute('PRAGMA read_uncommitted=true');</pre></code> executes fine.
    
    But sometimes it just returns an empty object or "undefined", so the execute fails and crashes the app.
    
    I don't know if this is related or helps, but I hope it does!
    
    Thanks</li>

    Greetings,
    
    Per the above suggestion from *@Hans* and *@Rene*, I added the following to the *<ios>* tag inside of *TiApp.XML*:
    
    <code><use-jscore-framework>false</use-jscore-framework></code>
    
    Doing this causes my app to crash immediately on boot.
    
    * We use Hyperloop
    * We have *run-on-main-thread* enabled.
    * We use Localytics via Hyperloop and this module: <a href="https://github.com/centrevilletech/localytics-hyperloop" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/centrevilletech/localytics-hyperloop</a>
    
    When the crash happens, nothing gets sent to the logs, so I'm unsure what's happening here.</li>
<li>Eric Wieber 2018-09-24

    To those who are updating their tiapp.xml with the jscore tag, but encounter a crash on launch:
    If you use the com.appcelerator.apm module and it is version 3.0.0 or earlier, it is unsupported on iOS 12 and can cause the crashes you are seeing. Please update to 3.1.0 or higher.</li>
<li>kosso 2018-09-24

    Just FWIW: My app has been running OK (so far) for about 5 hours or so on two devices:
    - iPad 5thGen - iOS 12
    - iPad2 - iOS 9.3.5  (!) 
     
    Built with Ti SDK 7.3.1.GA and XCode9 installed. (I have yet to make the Xcode 10 leap)
    The app includes many custom modules: a custom audio player x 2, audio file decryption, media file inspection, mass download batch management, a new native timer for audio crossfades and other duties, frequent SQLite usage and various secure API calls via Ti.Network.HTTPClient. 
    
    Note: it does not use Hyperloop. And it is a 'classic' app. Not alloy.
    
    I'll be keeping an eye on them all night, but they're running fine so far with 'run-on-main-thread' set to true and 'use-jscore-framework' set to false. 
    
    </li>
<li>Josh Lambert 2018-09-24

    @Eric Wieber I'm on 3.1.2 of com.appcelerator.apm and still get the crash. Doesn't appear to fix it for me.</li>
<li>Brian Knorr 2018-09-24

    We are also on 3.1.2 of apm and get the crash on startup with run-on-main-thread true and use-jscore-framework false.  Again we use Hyperloop in this app...specifically for card.io</li>
<li>kosso 2018-09-25

    Just to update on my extended tests: 
    iPad2 stopped overnight but was still responsive, though no memorywarning alert or anything). 
    iPad5th just crashed and closed after running for over 12 hours. (No ability to get logs until I update to XCode 10 - and I didn't have the console open at the time).  
    Also an 11.4 iPhone Simulator also just crashed. The crashed thread log has multiple mentions of com.apple.JavascriptCore despite it being disabled in tiapp.xml.

    hope this helps. 
    
    Additionally, in the Console app I noticed the most recent logs after the crash (which I cannot see) contained logs of the <code>videosubscriptionsd</code> process in loop, complaining about "Unable to find framework using path: /System/Library/Frameworks/VideoSubscriberAccount.framework".  Which is weird, since it's on the simulator. I have a feeling this is related to the Apple News app background refreshes. 
    
    Also, on the iPad5th which crashed and closed, I noticed the icons at the bottom of the screen changing a few times, more than usual, which is the 'handoff' feature trying to do things.  No idea if this is related.

    Hi everyone,
    indeed, with the use-jscore-framework setting set to false, the app never freezes but started to crash more often. This is becoming very stressing =/</li>
<li>Jason David Miller 2018-09-25

    Hey Hey,
    
    I also wanted to chime in just to note that my latest app crashes on startup (every time), _both_ device & simulator with:
    <code><pre>
    <use-jscore-framework>false</use-jscore-framework>
    </pre></code>
    - run-on-main-thread: true
    - works great with jscore enabled (however, there are infrequent crashes & restarts when bringing the app back into foreground)
    
    Appc Stack:
    · *TiSDK:* 7.4.0.GA
    · *Hyperloop:* 3.1.3 (enabled and in use with CocoaPods)
    · *Alloy:* 1.13.2
    · *iOS:* 12.0
    · *Xcode:* 10.0
    · *macOS:* 10.14 (Mojave)
    
    — Hopefully this is of some help =]
    
    Thanks for all of the hard work everyone!</li>
<li>Jeroen van Dijk 2018-09-25

    Another downside of reverting the use of jscore framework to 'false' is the fact that you could run into some issues in regards to the ECMA script support you got when using the 'true' mode. Some of the Javascript I wrote cannot be interpreted anymore when setting to false.</li>
<li>Matthew Delmarter 2018-09-25

    After spending the last few days trying to figure out what is going on, and reviewing everyones comments and suggestions, the following things are clear to me (nothing that hasn't been said before, I just wanted to summarise my thoughts):
    
    * There is something fundamentally different about how iOS 12 works, and it is not behaving well with Ti 7.4.0/Xcode 10
    * The issues are not easily reproducible
    * The issue is not isolated to using jscore (or not)
    * The issue is not isolated to using main thread (or not)
    * Some users are experiencing the app "hanging", others "crashing"
    * There are frequent references to setTimeout / setInterval - there must be something in that
    
    For my experience, I do not use Alloy - all my apps are classic.
    
    The issues for me are random, but frequent. I do not really have apps "hanging" - but I do see my apps "crashing". Sometimes on startup, sometimes at other places in the app flow. Some patterns have emerged:
    
    * There is definitely something odd going on with setTimeout. Don't ask my what as I cannot get a clear picture, but a percentage of the crashes do seem to happen when there are timeouts involved. 
    * I use JSON file stores a lot in my apps. Mainly because they have been so performant in all versions of iOS / Ti up till now. But there are definitely random issues related to loading files, parsing JSON and then the reverse - stringify and write file.
    
    I should mention that there were some reproducible crashes occurring related to memory usage. Using Instruments I managed to track them down and improve the code, and that has made a difference. This code worked fine on iOS 6-11, but all of a sudden an issue with iOS 12 - which lines up with the changes Apple said they were going to make around iOS 12 performance/memory usage I guess.
    
    But stepping back from these memory issues I managed to address, I am left with these random crashes. Every time I think I have fixed it by changing the flow of logic in the code, or the use of timeouts etc, I come back later and test again, and "crash" again :(
    
    Anyway ... at this stage I am a bit lost on how to proceed. I know the team is working very hard on this. But I am hoping that there is more on the table than just "disable jscore"? Are there other recommendations I can try?
    
    Overall I guess I am wanting reassurance that I am not the only one having issues in the areas of code I have described.</li>
<li>Vijay Singh 2018-09-26

    [~ppancholi] Can you please share your app on my email id vsingh@axway.com. Please mention the steps to reproduce the same. As your app in crashing on a particular screen, so it may be we can create a smaller test case with that to debug. Thanks!</li>
<li>David van de Meer 2018-09-26

    I am also seeing my app crash at random times, I will try to find a reproducible case but at this stage its only happened once or twice on the simulator a few seconds after startup - with no logs
    
    running hyperloop and have added tag to disable jscore</li>
<li>Carlos Henrique Zinato 2018-09-26

    What is maybe slowing down our process is that we can't see any error or logs when the app crashes or freezes. Can we add some logs on the iOS SDK so we start receiving them?</li>
<li>Fabian Martinez 2018-09-26

    This is the crash log from my device. It doesn't crash if I add <code><pre><use-jscore-framework>false</use-jscore-framework></pre></code> under the ios tag in tiapp.xml.

    We finally isolated the issue and have an initial fix ready for you guys. Please check the SDK from the following PR and let us know if it works for you.
    
    PR: <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/10352" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/10352</a></li>
<li>Carlos Henrique Zinato 2018-09-27

    Amazing! Testing it right now and can give you some feedback ASAP</li>
<li>kosso 2018-09-27

    Hi.Good news!
    
    Can you confirm which tiapp.xml settings we should be testing with for <code><pre>use-jscore-framework</pre></code>  and <code><pre>run-on-main-thread</pre></code>  
    
    thanks!</li>
<li>Vijay Singh 2018-09-27

    [~kosso] Any combination should work now. But default -
    
    <use-jscore-framework> true </use-jscore-framework >
    <run-on-main-thread> true </run-on-main-thread>
    
    should be specially tested. Thanks!</li>
<li>David van de Meer 2018-09-27

    @Vijay Singh - should we just patch the two files in our SDK as in the pull request or how do we get the correct SDK for testing? 
    
    In this PR: <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/10352" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/10352</a></li>
<li>kosso 2018-09-27

    That's is a good question. 
    How 'back-portable' is this fix?  
    Will it help earlier version of the SDK?  (eg: 7.3.1.GA) 
    
    thanks! </li>
<li>Vijay Singh 2018-09-27

    [~dieskim]
    Patching your sdk with this change is the best way to test now. This change will go in 7.4.1 SDK.
    </li>
<li>Matthew Delmarter 2018-09-27

    Initial testing against 7.4.0.GA with the patch is looking very positive. No crashes yet!</li>
<li>Matthew Delmarter 2018-09-27

    I can only imagine the effort that went into those 6 lines of code. Thanks so much team for your efforts.</li>
<li>Taylor Thompson 2018-09-27

    How do I go about about getting the patched SDK? We're experiencing this same issue in all of our apps and it's put us in a broken state.</li>
<li>Pankti Pancholi 2018-09-27

    How can I get 7.4.1.GA, When I try to install through appc ti sdk install with 7.4.1 it says 7.4.0 is the latest version</li>
<li>Jeroen van Dijk 2018-09-27

    Amazing job guys! Our app implementation feels rock solid again after patching the 7.2.1 SDK. Thank you so much for the effort!</li>
<li>Nirmal 2018-09-27

    @Taylor Thompson <a href="https://www.appcelerator.com/blog/2018/06/patch-titanium-sdk-using-cherry-picking/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.appcelerator.com/blog/2018/06/patch-titanium-sdk-using-cherry-picking/</a> 
    Or if you just want to test with latest:
    
    <code><pre>
    git clone <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile.git" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile.git</a>
    git checkout 7_4_X
    cd titanium_mobile/build
    npm install 
    node scons.js cleanbuild ios
    </pre></code>
    
    </li>
<li>Jan Vennemann 2018-09-28

    The patch was merged and you can now get the fixed SDK directly via CLI if you select the 7_4_X branch: <code>appc ti sdk install -b 7_4_X</code></li>
<li>Carlos Henrique Zinato 2018-09-28

    Great work guys! It doesn't seem to freeze anymore with both flags set to TRUE.
    Do you guys mind sharing how did you manage to isolate the problem? Or how did you find what was causing the issue?
    Thanks for the effort everyone</li>
<li>Matthew Delmarter 2018-09-28

    +1 I was going to ask the same questions...</li>
<li>Christy Thomas 2018-09-28

    I tested this fix to see if it fixed AC-5928 and I am still seeing the original problem described in that ticket.  Should it have resolved that issue as well?
    
    I have run-on-main-thread set to true and removed the jscore line so it should be true now.
    
    7.4.1.v20180927102822 is the SDK version I am using after running:
    <code><pre>
    appc ti sdk install -b 7_4_X
    </pre></code></li>
<li>Andreas Pingas 2018-09-28

    With the updates on sdk 7.4.1 (Thu Sep 27) in random times i get a black screen and app stops running. On previous versions of sdk 7.4.1 this issue did not appear. :(

    Thanks for all hard work guys but new version did not resolve my error totally, Now it is not crashing anymore but it is still freeze on random screen and also I am not using hyperloop module anywhere in my iOS app so before if I enable hyperloop I ws getting some errors, Without enabling hyperloop it was working fine but now without enabling hyperloop I am getting same errors only on ios 12</li>
<li>Jason David Miller 2018-09-29

    I'm also experiencing frequent, random app freezing now. Before the SDK fix, I would experience an immediate crash on app launch. That crashing has been resolved (on my end), however, a few different app interactions are now causing app freezes (no crash, no log). This could be from a button click (to call an HTTP request), adding or removing views, showing a NavigationWindow (modals), etc. — Since there is no error log output, I'm afraid I cannot provide much more, I just wanted to share my experience with the latest 7_4_X patched SDK (on iOS 12). — Thanks again for all of the great work & effort being put into these fixes! · Jason</li>
<li>Jeroen van Dijk 2018-09-29

    OK, this issue is still not completely resolved from my perspective. The number of freezes changed from frequent to sporadic, but the issue isn't completely gone. The freezes do not occur when disabling the use of the JSCore framework.</li>
<li>Vijay Singh 2018-10-01

    For those who are still facing issue- 
    Can you please share your test case with which we can reproduce the bug. It will help us debugging and will help us finding if the issue is same as mentioned in this ticket or different.
    Or if you can share your app to my email vsingh@axway.com so that we can debug. Thanks!</li>
<li>Jan Vennemann 2018-10-01

    Apart from reproducible test cases, crash logs with stack traces would also be a tremendous help to narrow down the cause of any remaining issues. Please connect your device and check in Xcode under the Devices and Simulators window. There is a button to open a list of recent device logs which should include the crash log for your app. If they don't show up make sure to sync your device with iTunes because if there are more than 25 crash logs on your device, no new crash logs will be created.</li>

    This is still an issue on our production apps.  We are noticing random freezes and crashes when trying to authenticate using a webview.
    
    We have shared a sample app that reproduces this issue in Case# 01006092 / iOS 12 App Crash With Xcode 10.0 Appc SDK 7.4 
    
    Should this ticket be reopened or are you guys fixing this as a separate Jira issue?
    
    </li>
<li>Jan Vennemann 2018-10-04

    First of, thanks for all the feedback which showed os that we got the root cause of the issue! Still, there seem to be a few edge cases that our current fix does not cover.
    
    We are currently working on an improved version of the fix. This will also address a regression introduced with the fix where some event listeners are not properly fired thus giving the impression of app freezes because it suddenly stops its usual workflow.
    
    As soon as it is ready we'll let you know!</li>

    I don't have app freezing and crashing issues any more Without using <use-jscore-framework> and 
    <run-on-main-thread> 
    
    With this new SDK I mean with all version of 7.4.1 my app doesn't update device token which functionality I am using in App, It was working fine with 7.2.0 but not with new SDK</li>
<li>Vijay Singh 2018-10-08

    [~ppancholi] We have deprecated 'kroll-thread' and 'ticore'  and have to remove from SDK 8.0.0. So we have to fix all issue related with 'main-thread' and 'jscore'. If you can share your reproducible test case or app project with us, would be great. It will help us to find the edge cases which is still not handled. Thanks!</li>
<li>Pankti Pancholi 2018-10-08

    I have shared app project zip on vsingh@axway.com, jvennemann@axway.com from dropbox with in detail messages regarding App functionality and error, Please check and let me know but we need to resolve this as soon as possible because current app in app store is crashing on iOS 12 and new SDK solved crushing and Freezing problem but with this issue we can not do new release </li>
<li>Brian Knorr 2018-10-08

    We just started testing with the latest 7_4_X branch with jscore and run-on-main-thread both true.  It mostly freezes now on startup.  It's easy to reproduce...just keep removing your app from the multi-task bar and then re-opening.  It will freeze half the time.  We make several network calls on startup and I think this is a big part of the issue that causes the main ui thread to freeze up and become unresponsive.  We really need a fix for this asap.</li>
<li>Brian Knorr 2018-10-08

     Okay this is very interesting...if we remove the AppC generated code in Alloy.js for logging into ACS we no longer get the freeze on startup.</li>
<li>Jan Vennemann 2018-10-08

     [~ppancholi], after a quick check of your submitted project it looks like you are experiencing issues with notifications. Please open a dedicated ticket for that as the scope of this tickets are solely the crashes in JSC. Describe in detail what steps to take to reproduce your issue, what is the actual behavior and what should be the expected behavior.
     
     [~btknorr], testing with a sample Alloy app does not crash/freeze for us, so it is probably a combination of things. Again, please provide reproducible test cases with as much information as possible or submit your project to help us narrow down any remaining issues and if they are related to the initial JSC crash reported here. Thanks!</li>
<li>Brian Knorr 2018-10-08

     Jan - please be sure you are testing on actual devices and not the simulator.  Also the freeze happens much more often on older iPhones like the 6 and 7.  Unfortunately we cannot submit any of our client's proprietary apps.  Also there are no stack traces when the app freezes...it just becomes unresponsive to any interactions.</li>
<li>Jan Vennemann 2018-10-08

     I'm testing on an iPhone 6s Plus and was able to reproduce all previous crashes there. However, i have not yet seen an actual app freeze yet, only crashes. Other reported "freezes" where due to events not being fired properly and thus the app appearing to be frozen.
     
     If you don't mind please ask your clients if you are allowed to share code with Axway to investigate the issues. The project will only be used by our engineers for the sole purpose of identifying any remaining edge cases for iOS 12 issues. We really want to help you guys, but as the issues seems to mostly appear in real life app projects with many moving parts working together we dependent on you providing us with test cases/projects to work with.</li>
<li>Brian Knorr 2018-10-08

     Now that we are past the startup freeze, we are now seeing freezes just by using app after some time.  Seems directly related to making an http call to get data and updating the UI.  Also we don't get crashes...only freezes.</li>
<li>Pankti Pancholi 2018-10-08

     @jvennemann 
     I am having this issue with 7.4.1 and all new sdk only, If you try with 7.2.0 It is not happening, and Without using 7.4.1 my app is crashing and freezing so it has something to do with this new update only, as I am converting push messages to alert when app is open, Everything is working fine with until I update SDK apart from crash and freeze in ios 12, I will generate separate ticket for this</li>
<li>Jan Vennemann 2018-10-09

     [~ppancholi], this ticket deals with crashes and freezes under iOS 12 only and your issue seems to be neither a crash nor a freeze. We can't deal with all 7.4.0 issues in only one ticket, this gets confusing real quick. Please open a new ticket describing in detail what your issue is and mention me in the comments. I'll move it to TIMOB and investigate as soon as i can.
     
     // EDIT: Sorry it was early in the morning and i didn't see your last sentence that you will create a new ticket. Thanks a lot for helping us organize the issues related to 7.4.0 ;)</li>

<li>David Bankier 2018-10-10

     Just to echo @Brian Knorr. While the latest nightly is much improved, I am still getting crashes and freezes.
     Unfortunately I also have highly secure financial and telecommunications apps that I can't share the source.
     I have been trying to create simple apps to replicate the issues unsuccessfully.
     Much like Brian, these apps have live feeds and/or many concurrent api calls that update the UI. It is during or after api calls that I am (guessing) are the cause. (Stack traces don't help much.)
     
     This might help... I have found Titanium on iOS 12 more "fragile". One fix I applied was related to an issue that during a window transition, I updated the UI (modifying a TableViewSection) and triggered API calls to refresh the UI content. The crash occurred when that sequence was performed about three times. To fix I simply added a delay of 200ms before making the API calls (I think the time for the animation to complete). I had applied a similar fix to Android to fix a crash that was occurring under these conditions previously. </li>
<li>Jan Vennemann 2018-10-10

     Due to lack of test cases we currently are having a hard time to further investigate this. To move forward i created a special 7.4.1 build which includes a ton of debugging output. Please run your app with this build and send me the log output along with a possible crash report to [mailto:jvennemann@axway.com].
     
     Please also add as much debug info to your app as well, especially to callbacks of your HTTP requests or other event handlers so we have a rough idea where in your app the crash or freeze happened. Valuable information is the proxy and event name of callback functions.

     An uncaught exception was thrown!
     Invalid Version: 12.-1.0

     [~TaylorThompson], do a full clean by deleting the <code>build</code> folder when switching between versions. If the issue persists, please open a new ticket for issues other than crashes related to JSC or freezes. If you do, please also enabled trace logging with <code>-l trace</code> and post the full logs, since just a simple "BUILD FAILED" does not help us in identifying the problem.</li>
<li>Fabian Martinez 2018-10-11

     If it fails when compiling to the device with only "BUILD FAILED" check your tiapp.xml that you have the correct app <id> and that you are using the correct Provisioning Profile for that device.</li>
<li>David Bankier 2018-10-14

     @Jan Venneman, that build helps. It helped to catch one crash that the previous sdks didn't present.
     Basically the cause in this one case was updating the contents of a <code>TableViewRow</code> that had been removed from the table, yet the reverence was still held with JS (on the alloy <code>$</code>). The crash was a <code>EXC_BAD_ACCESS</code>. It looks like the ObjC objects were freed from memory despite existing JS references to them. I have worked around that crash, but you might want to look at it anyway.
     
     It would be good to have this "trace" logging as a feature going in future sdks.
     
     I will continue working to with this debug sdk for the other crashes and freezes.</li>
<li>David van de Meer 2018-10-15

     Hi all,
     
     Thanks for all the effort to get to the bottom of it. Most people have good results, and working with JS Core disabled provides a work-around.
     However I am still getting freezes on an actual ipad (not simulated) with JS Core enabled. Mostly when I am doing an action that takes many REST Requests (it's ecom) login, getbaskets, get wishlists, load adresses etc.
     
     I am happy to provide the App code somewhere privately, but maybe [these log](<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/10FpdKH9IiN3JwDDIYMtnGqKlncCtks-B/view?usp=sharing)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://drive.google.com/file/d/10FpdKH9IiN3JwDDIYMtnGqKlncCtks-B/view?usp=sharing)</a> files traced with the debug SDK help already.

     Hey guys, we are changing the status of this ticket to resolved for the upcoming 7.4.1 GA release. This is required for our internal JIRA workflow. We are fully aware that some of you still have issues so we will keep this issue open (with state resolved, but not closed yet).
     
     The initial crash we could reproduce was solved and we are actively working together with some of you to reproduce other issues like the freezes. Once we have more insight on those the ticket will be put back into "In progress" state. Sorry in advance for the inconvenience and unnecessary mails this might cause.</li>
<li>Diego Freniche 2018-10-18

     @Jan Vennemann. Thank for the heads up!
     
     In our case, we can't replicate as we get random crashes, always related to jscore not being able to launch a new code block. Most probably a closure/block got deallocated. Always happening when doing lots of HTTP requests and showing data in ListViews. Something like this:

      My (uneducated and totally made-up guess) is that maybe [Apple optimized JavaScript execution so much](<a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2018/09/24/iphone-xs-benchmarks/)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://mjtsai.com/blog/2018/09/24/iphone-xs-benchmarks/)</a> in the new iOS 12 that they are introducing some non-compatible or breaking changes to Appc code? 
     
     The 7.4.1 build with all the built-in logs seems less crashy here, just FYI
     
     Thanks!</li>
<li>Kai Lu 2018-10-22

     The same freeze issue here. Throughout normal testing on iOS, the app intermittently freezes and I have to quit/restart the app.
     
     This has been happening consistently for the past 2-3 weeks. Got a lot better upgrading to 7.4.1 but still happens from time to time.
     
     Had the run-on-main-thread set to true.
     
     The freeze/crash happens randomly on various screens, but the majority of the freezes happen when transitioning between screens.
     
     I've seen this consistently on iOS, but not once on Android. </li>
<li>Brian Knorr 2018-10-22

     Can we get this issue re-opened or create a new one?  Doesn't make sense that the status is Resolved and Fixed, when it's not.</li>
<li>Jason David Miller 2018-10-23

     *Update:* I posed a few weeks back & just wanted to note that my current experience is greatly similar to that of @Kai Lu. — Frequent freezing in TiSDK 7.4.0+ / slightly less freezing in TiSDK 7.4.1+ — iOS is my primary focus, so I cannot report on Android.
     
     <code><pre>
     <property name="run-on-main-thread" type="bool">true</property>
     <use-jscore-framework>true</use-jscore-framework>

     *Stack:*
     * iOS 12
     * TiSDK 7.4.1.GA
     * Alloy 1.13.3
     * Xcode 10.0
     * Hyperloop 3.1.4</li>
<li>Jan Vennemann 2018-10-23

     First off, thanks for all the feedback. As promised i reopened the issue. However we still have a hard time reproducing this issue. As some of you already wrote these freezes are most likely due to optimization and changes to the internals in Apple's JavaScriptCore, especially GC handling.
     
     When you are experiencing freezes, will iOS terminate the app after you wait for ~10 sec? If so, please look for crash reports on your device and post them here.
     
     We are also still looking for app projects to reproduce the freezes so we can do some actual debugging on that. If you can share your project with us please send it to [mailto:jvennemann@axway.com] or [mailto:vsingh@axway.com]. All code is considered private and confidential of course and will only be used for the purpose of helping us debug the freeze issue.
     
     Last but not least: If you are using timers in your app and experience freezes please check this build which contains a minor change to how timer callbacks are executed to prevent possible thread deadlocks. <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/zasd5dd7j9xl7lx/mobilesdk-7.4.2-osx.zip?dl=0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.dropbox.com/s/zasd5dd7j9xl7lx/mobilesdk-7.4.2-osx.zip?dl=0</a></li>
<li>Kai Lu 2018-10-23

     Hi Jan,
     
     Really appreciate your quick response. We do have a timer in the background constantly checking with the database sync.
     
     Will test on 7.4.2 to see if that helps with the freezes.
     
     Thanks,
     
     Kai</li>
<li>Kai Lu 2018-10-23

     Just tried 7.4.2 but unfortunately the freeze issue is still happening and by digging into the log I could not find a pattern as to where in the code it freezes (seems pretty random to me) but it all happened when I open a new window.
     
     We are currently in the beta testing stage with a critical product release in coming.. you know we were going to choose a different tool and we chose you because you can get this stuff done and will evolve.. but it's holding up our business at this point so a quick fix of this freeze issue is MOST appreciated.</li>
<li>David Bankier 2018-10-23

     Apologies if this is noise. But due to release time lines, we have reverted to <use-jscore-framework>false</use-jscore-framework> which greatly improves stability.
     Can we ensure non-jscore usage is not deprecated? I think having jscore as a dependacy is proving to be a liability. </li>
<li>Greg 2018-10-23

     100% agree with @dbankier - we have had to release our apps with jscore disabled and have had no issue since, so ideally we must ensure that this functionality is not deprecated until such time as the jscore implementation is robust.</li>
<li>Kai Lu 2018-10-23

     Thanks David for the solution. I can verify it is working a lot better now.
     
     Definitely agree with David and Greg on keeping the non-jscore without deprecation.
     
     So much more stable and even faster than Apple's JS engine.</li>
<li>Jason David Miller 2018-10-23

     Thank you for the continued efforts, Jan!
     
     We're currently using Hyperloop (and plan to extend that use) in our current project.
     
     *Question:* Does Hyperloop require (JavaScriptCore)? — I gather it does. — If so, we don't really have the option to disable it, even as a temporary solution like some of the devs above suggest. Any additional thoughts?</li>
<li>Leonardo Amigoni 2018-10-23

     I have also had to use <use-jscore-framework>false</use-jscore-framework> but I have found some issues that I have had to deal with which I attribute to concurrency issues. If you add views in a loop to a layout vertical view. The child views don't display properly. I have to use an interval to add them at a 10 ms interval to get them to work. Option dialog buttons seem not to fire correctly most of the time so I had to replace them with non-native option dialogs. There are other issues that are more difficult to describe but I think all related to concurrency. Finally performance is lagging a bit with it.</li>
<li>Matthew Delmarter 2018-10-23

     @Leonardo - did you try the 7.4.2 build as described above by Jan? It has some changes to optimise timer callbacks etc which might help you. I am still testing, but it seems to have reduced issues for me so far...

<li>Jan Vennemann 2018-10-30

     Alright guys, here is another update for you. We replaced our timer handling in jscore with native timers and it looks very promising. First tests with various projects proved positive results and the app freezes were gone.
     
     To get more feedback we would like to ask you once more to test with the following new build:
     
     <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/80bqt55221yqeiu/mobilesdk-7.5.0-osx.zip?dl=0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.dropbox.com/s/80bqt55221yqeiu/mobilesdk-7.5.0-osx.zip?dl=0</a>
     
     Especially if you are having <code>run-on-main-thread</code> set to false since we couldn't verify this yet in a project that reproduces the freezes.</li>
<li>Matthew Delmarter 2018-10-30

     @Jan - is the timer handling much different from the 7.4.2 build you gave us recently?</li>
<li>Jan Vennemann 2018-10-30

     [~mdelmarter], yes! Actually, it's a complete rewrite replacing the old timers when using JSCore.</li>
<li>Muhammad Ahmed Fahad 2018-10-30

     Jan Vennemann? Do I need to make any config changes in order to make my project run with 7.5.0? 
     
     Right now when I try to build, I get the following error:
     [INFO] :   Invoking xcodebuild

     No, you shouldn't have to change anything. Please post logs with at least debug log level so we can see what is going on.</li>

     Hey Jan,
     
     I haven't done any _extensive_ testing with 7.5.0, however, it does seem to greatly improve the stability of my current app which was freezing consistently with 7.4.X. Thank you for the continued effort on this issue! — I'm going to keep testing w/7.5.0 moving forward. I'll stay tuned into this ticket & report any buggy activity.

     Hi Jan, is there a way we can add the latest changes to 7.4.1 ? As 7.5.0 has so many other changes we would really like to just fix this issue with our current app setup. Is there a specific commit or pull we can cherry pick on top of 7.4.1 to take advantage of the latest changes? </li>
<li>Peter Ladis 2018-10-30

     When I install 7.5.0 and use...I get this message and the app doesn't start up
     
     [WARN]   The implicit global scope for variable declarations in app.js is deprecated in 7.5.0, and will be removed in 9.0.0
     
     [ERROR]  Script Error Module "app.js" failed to leave a valid exports object
     
     
     ANY IDEAS</li>
<li>Steven van Loef 2018-10-30

     @Peter Ladis, could be an uninitialize global variable like:
     
     
     <code><pre>
     var myVar;
     </pre></code>
     
     </li>
<li>kosso 2018-10-30

     @Peter :  Are you 'polluting the global scope' with  <code>Ti.App.my_custom_thing</code>  in app.js ?
     
     I _think_ this is what the deprecation refers to. It's been discouraged for a while, since I _think_ it causes issues with memory garbage collection. 
     
     
     </li>
<li>Jan Vennemann 2018-10-30

     There is a known issue currently in 7.5.0 that causes problems if you use third-party modules and assign them using the <code>ns</code> attribute in your Alloy templates instead of using the recommended <code>module</code> attribute.
     
     I'll prepare a backport of the timer changes for a 7.4.2 build so you can exclusively test those changes and will share it with you here once it's ready.</li>
<li>Peter Ladis 2018-10-30

     So I have code like this in my app.js
     
     function include(file) {
         return eval(Ti.Filesystem.getFile(Ti.Filesystem.resourcesDirectory, file).read().text);
     }
     
     and then below...I bring in the moment.js  class like this
     
     include('ui/common/moment.js');
     
     
     
     But for some reason getting initialization errors like this:

<li>Steven van Loef 2018-10-30

     @Jan Vennemann I installed your 7.5.0 (thanks!) and reverted that 'unarchiveFromTemplate' method in TiViewProxy.m back to the one in 7.4.1.GA (because my app uses some 3rd party modules like you mention, also see: <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/10131)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/10131)</a> and my app has been without freeze for two hours now while using it 'extensively'. With 7.4.1.GA it would freeze within 5 to 15 minutes.
     
     (edit) Forget to mention: running with use-jscore-framework and run-on-main-thread both turned on.</li>
<li>Peter Ladis 2018-10-30

     @Jan.....Thanks ill wait for 7.4.2 build with the freeze fixes </li>

     > I'll prepare a backport of the timer changes for a 7.4.2 build so you can exclusively test those changes and will share it with you here once it's ready.
     
     @Jan Vennemann I'd also love the 7.4.2 backport and will try it out and give feedback right away (we'll have ~30 people test it). 
     
     We're in a [bit of trouble](<a href="https://gymhero.me/community/t/version-2-24-released/2683)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://gymhero.me/community/t/version-2-24-released/2683)</a> because of this bug, and I'd love to submit an update as soon as possible :)</li>
<li>Sergey Nosenko 2018-10-30

     Hi,
     
     @Jan thank you for <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/zasd5dd7j9xl7lx/mobilesdk-7.4.2-osx.zip?dl=0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.dropbox.com/s/zasd5dd7j9xl7lx/mobilesdk-7.4.2-osx.zip?dl=0</a> it works for me with jscore and main thread turned on.
     
     I was in trouble to extract and use 7.4.2 SDK from zip, so I just extracted folder "iphone" over my 7.4.1.GA and no freezes or crashes now in my app. 
     
     Great job!  And I also wait for backport to 7.4.2</li>
<li>Peter Ladis 2018-10-30

     Which build is good to go for freezing issues....the older 7.4.2 did not fix anything?</li>
<li>Peter Ladis 2018-10-30

     @sergey.....is that build a new 7.4.2. or one from the other day with problems still</li>
<li>Peter Ladis 2018-10-30

     Any  update on this?</li>
<li>Jan Vennemann 2018-10-30

     Sorry, it took a little longer. We detected an issue when run-on-main-thread is set to false and had to disable the new timer implementation for that.
     
     Now, i updated the 7.4.2 build i shared earlier to the newest version. Here is the download link again: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/zasd5dd7j9xl7lx/mobilesdk-7.4.2-osx.zip?dl=0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.dropbox.com/s/zasd5dd7j9xl7lx/mobilesdk-7.4.2-osx.zip?dl=0</a>
     
     To enable the new timer implementation it is required to use js core (enabled by default or explicitly via <code><use-jscore-framework>true</use-jscore-framework></code> under <code>ios</code>) and run on main thread also set to true with <code><property name="run-on-main-thread" type="bool">true</property></code>. We also included the change from the earlier 7.4.2 to timers when not using main thread which proved to help for some of you.</li>
<li>David van de Meer 2018-10-31

     @Jan Vennemann - will you guys be able to just release the new timer fixes as part of 7.4.2.GA rather than part of 7.5.0? 7.5.0 has many other changes that many apps might require alot of work to get working (including ours) and if this fix could be released as part of 7.4.2.GA that would be great as it would mean most people could simply update from 7.4.0 / 7.4.1 to 7.4.2 without any real work to their apps.</li>
<li>Matthew Delmarter 2018-10-31

     +1 on David's suggestion. Priority is getting a stable SDK that fixes this issue. I am not even sure what is in 7.5.0 to ensure that other areas are working - will tackle that when we get the formal Release Notes etc.
     
     Thanks again for the great work team. Initial feedback from my beta testers is that everything is much more stable with zero app freezing.</li>
<li>David van de Meer 2018-10-31

     </li>
<li>Jan Vennemann 2018-10-31

     The above 7.4.2 is basically what you are asking for. An updated 7.4.1 with only the timer fixes. I'm not sure if we can squeeze in an official 7.4.2 release because the GA process takes time and resources are already reserved for 7.5.0 and 8.0.0. However, we'll discuss this internally and see what we can do.
     
     [~dieskim], why would the changes in TIMOB-24909 cause a few days work? Not overly familiar with that ticket, but shouldn't the implementation be 100% backward compatible?</li>
<li>David van de Meer 2018-10-31

     @Jan Vennemann thanks for the info. Do you have a specific branch on your fork of titanium_mobile on GitHub that is the 7.4.2 version? That way we could use that 7.4.2 and build cherry pick other fixed we need etc on top of that as needed. It should be good enough for people to build their own sdk versions and get apps out there. Maybe you already have a branch I could not find or maybe you can create a 7.4.2 branch?  Thanks for all the hard work on this. I'll build our apps with 7.4.2 tomorrow and let you know how it goes. </li>
<li>Clint Oaks 2018-10-31

     In iOS 11, this 7.4.2 did help with a lot of crashes in our app.  We get 1 crash, after allowing permissions to push notifications, but after that the app doesn't crash.  Push notifications do not seem to be working still in iOS 11.</li>
<li>Leonardo Amigoni 2018-11-01

     Question on 7.4.2 was there any change to the modules or can we just drop the sdk mobilesdk folder?</li>
<li>Christian Clare 2018-11-01

     We also could use a 7.4.2 branch with timer fixes applied rather than these only going into 7.5.0. We need to rebuild the 7.4.2 SDK with our fixes applied (and the new timer fixes) so could use a branch with a commit to cherry-pick on top of 7_4_X.
     
     Looked in master and 7_4_X and 7_5_X but couldn't see a commit that matched the native timer fixes that stopped the app hanging.
     
     Thanks... these hangs are causing major problems for our customers.</li>
<li>Jan Vennemann 2018-11-01

     The PR with the new timer implementation is still under review and testing, so it is not merged into any of the main branches yet.
     
     [~dieskim] and everyone else asking for 7_4_X branch line, here you go: [timer-refactor-7_4_X](<a href="https://github.com/janvennemann/titanium_mobile/tree/timer-refactor-7_4_X)." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/janvennemann/titanium_mobile/tree/timer-refactor-7_4_X).</a> This is the branch used in [this](<a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/10416)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/10416)</a> 7_4_X PR i just opened.
     
     [~amigoni], the 7.4.2 build has no other changes, you can just drop the sdk into your mobilesdk folder.</li>
<li>David van de Meer 2018-11-01

     @Jan Vennemann thank you so much. That's perfect. 
     
     I can confirm that this 7.4.2 build is much better for us, but it is not completely bug free yet. Our app ran for 30 minutes with aggressive usage and testing and then crashed. The crash was once again cause by setting and accessing objects via Hyperloop, exactly as before but it did last longer. Jan it's the same crash as before in the emails I sent you but the app did last alot longer this time. I will work with our tester tomorrow to see if we can reproduce</li>
<li>Jan Vennemann 2018-11-01

     Glad to hear that it's working for you. Please open a new ticket regarding the Hyperloop issue with all relevant information so we can then investigate what's going on in that new ticket.</li>
<li>Jan Vennemann 2018-11-01

     The new timer implementation is now merged to all our main branch lines!
     
     Just to let you know we plan to put out a 7.4.2.GA to bring just the timer fixes to 7.4.X. It will be released alongside 7.5.0.GA.</li>

<li>Jan Vennemann 2018-11-02

     [~mr.jatinjoshi.mca@gmail.com], please make sure you are using JSCore and have run-on-main-thread enabled. If a crash occurs make sure to get the related crash report from the device. Also provide the logs and as much other information as possible. We can't do much with "it crashed" and no other information at all.</li>

     Hi Jan,
     
     We using device with OS Version: iPhone OS 12.0.1 (16A404). Crashes happening on iOS 12.x only. 
     *No crashes on 11.x and 10.x*
     
     I tested my app on 7.4.2 after installing it : appc ti sdk install --branch 7_4_X 7.4.2.v20181101134650
     and still the app freezed suddenly at point and then app crashed.
     I have enabled the two properties as you mentioned:
     <property name="run-on-main-thread" type="bool">true</property>
     <use-jscore-framework>true</use-jscore-framework>
     
     *Scenario*
     * App launching without crashes and landing in dashboard page.
     * Now, Kill the app manually and Again, Open the app.
     * App crash issue occurred. 
     
     *Please check my crash report*

<li>Venkateshkumar 2018-11-13

     Hi Jan,
     
     Please check symbolicated crash logs of my app from Xcode in the below link <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/nhatk51tm0q4g0u/Scalepoint%20%2013-11-18%2C%204-14%20PM.txt?dl=0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.dropbox.com/s/nhatk51tm0q4g0u/Scalepoint%20%2013-11-18%2C%204-14%20PM.txt?dl=0</a></li>
<li>Jan Vennemann 2018-11-13

     [~venkateshkumarg], thank's for the symbolicated crash log. However, there are no indicators that this is related to JavaScriptCore or Timers. Please open a separate ticket and attach the crash log and, if possible, provide a reproducible test case, thanks.</li>
<li>Venkateshkumar 2018-11-13

     Thanks Jan, Thanks for quick response. I will create new ticket with crash log and test case. </li>

     Hi All, We have received issue from one of our customer. The app is continuously crashing under IOS12. It is working under IOS11 without issues. As downgrade is not possible on IOS level they are frustrated and looking for a fix.
     
     We have already suggested to get recent Appcelerator SDK 7.4.2 and they have already added the possible jscore setting:
     
     <code><pre>
     <use-jscore-framework>false</use-jscore-framework>
     </pre></code>
     
     CrashLogs can be downloaded under: <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1m4ZV7zm4jR-3Ta9HtQ1bpiZmiZwHi8XA" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1m4ZV7zm4jR-3Ta9HtQ1bpiZmiZwHi8XA</a></li>
<li>Jan Vennemann 2018-11-13

     For 7.4.2 and onward it is important to have jscore *enabled* to benefit from the fixes made in the ticket. Also, i'm unable to access the logs you shared (missing permissions).</li>
<li>Alexander 2018-11-13

     Hi Jan, thanks for the update. I've shared the drive doc again. Please let me know if you can access this now.</li>
<li>Jan Vennemann 2018-11-13

     [~aboldt], i see threads with <code>KrollTimer</code> in your crash log which mean you are not running with <code>use-jscore-framework</code> set to true and <code>run-on-main-thread</code> also set to true. Please make sure to properly configure the app in <code>tiapp.xml</code> and enabled JSCore as well as run-on-main-thread, then test again with the most recent 7.4.2 build from my comment above.</li>
<li>Alexander 2018-11-13

     Hi Jan, Thanks for the quick feedback. Please confirm that the following within tiapp.xml is the correct setting
     <code><pre>
     <property name="run-on-main-thread" type="bool">false</property>
         <ios>
             ...
             <use-jscore-framework>true</use-jscore-framework>
     </pre></code></li>
<li>Jan Vennemann 2018-11-13

     See my previous comment, <code>run-on-main-thread</code> must be <code>true</code>.</li>
<li>Alexander 2018-11-14

     Customer has tested changes but the crashes are still consistent. new crash logs have been uploaded to: <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1FGrko2EKct1rv4ShqDiRJhD0AtM0Lc0Z." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1FGrko2EKct1rv4ShqDiRJhD0AtM0Lc0Z.</a> I have search for the mentioned KrollTimer in those new logs but they are not recorded anymore. any pointers what could be the reason on this? 
     Thank you for your feedback.</li>

     I'm on TiSDK 7.5.0 GA and experiencing random crashes in regard to tableview layout and interaction on an iPhone running iOS 12.0.1.
     
     These iOS12 crashing problems need to be escalated and resolved as soon as possible. Should not be occurring on 7.5.0 GA.
     
     Essentially there is a survey with a scroll view consisting of about 15 table views with 7 rows per tableview.
     
     The app will crash when app is building the tableview row contents.
     
     Here is the start of crash log (i dont see option to add file here):

     [~jonkravetz], your app is not running on main thread. Please add <code><property name="run-on-main-thread" type="bool">true</property></code> to your tiapp.xml. If the issue persists open a new ticket and submit a reproducible test case.</li>
<li>jon kravetz 2018-11-21

     I changed the "run-on-main-thread" property to true and the issue still persists:
     
     It is hard for me to figure out how I can submit a reproducible test case in this situation, because the app has a robust architecture and it would be difficult/time-consuming to figure out how separate this functionality for sharing.
     
     Here is the crash log:

     I have started using new titanium 7.5.0 and got app crush and it gave me following error on console, Its working fine with 7.4.2 though
     
     I have set following properties to false in my tiapp.xml as it was working fine only with false in 7.4.0

<li>Rene Pot 2018-12-05

     [~ppancholi] you will need to put the properties on true for the fix to be applied. Can you try it with that?</li>
<li>Jan Vennemann 2018-12-05

     Please note that the use-jscore-framework is no property and rather has to go inside the <code><ios></code> section as a node if you specifiy it. Using JSCore is true by default. The structure of you <code>tiapp.xml</code> should look like this.
     
     <code><pre>
     <ti:app>
       <property name="run-on-main-thread" type="bool">true</property>
       <ios>
         <use-jscore-framework>true</use-jscore-framework> <!-- optional, true by default since 7.0.0 -->
       </ios>
     </ti:app>
     </pre></code>
     
     </li>
<li>Pankti Pancholi 2018-12-05

     Thanks for help!
     
     It's working fine with properties set to true</li>
<li>jon kravetz 2018-12-06

     Wondering whether there are any updates for this issue? We provided our code and are interested to know whether it has been tested, if there is any feedback.</li>
<li>Simon Buckingham 2018-12-06

     This is very confusing. I have been following this thread for a while on and off now.
     
     Earlier on people were saying you need to set the "use-jscore-framework" flag to false to get things to work.
     
     Now @jvennemann is saying use true.
     
     What exactly does this flag do and how does it affect performance? Again from earlier reading of comments it seemed that all this flag does is allow debugging in Safari (which is not needed usually), but maybe it has more reach than that.
     
     In our app we moved from Ti SDK 7.4.1 to 7.5.0 and had an immediate improvement in performance (everything faster with no freezes). But we are using "use-jscore-framework" set to false.
     
     </li>
<li>Jan Vennemann 2018-12-07

     [~jonkravetz], we have received another test case which lets us reproduce the issue in 7.5.0 reliably and we have found the change in 7.5.0 that introduced the issue. Working on a fix right now!
     
     [~icecandyent], use-jscore-framework switches from our legacy TiCore to the official JavaScriptCore framework from Apple as the JavaScript runtime. TiCore is an old fork of JavaScriptCore which we did to implement various changes that were necessary in the earlier days of Titanium. Since then Apple's official JavaScriptCore framework also implemented those changes and we could switch back to use that and also benefit from all the optimizations and improvements Apple implemented there. In 8.0.0, TiCore will be removed and JavaScriptCore is the only available JS runtime on iOS. So it does a little more than just "allowing debugging in Safari".
     
     When this issue first came up it was an easy workaround to use TiCore because the issue was related to GC optimizations done by Apple in JavaScriptCore. For others the changing the <code>ron-on-main-thread</code> property also seemed to help. If this property is set to false, JavaScript execution runs on a separate thread. Since this can cause issues when interacting with the UI (which always needs to be done on the main thread) this property is also deprecated and will be removed in 8.0.0.
     
     After making several fixes to our core users could switch back to use JavaScriptCore and <code>run-on-main-thread</code>. We have a few outstanding reports about continued crashes which we are investigating.
     
     Hope this clears up a few things!</li>
<li>Simon Buckingham 2018-12-07

     [~jvennemann] thank you very much for the clear explanation. I hope you are putting this somewhere important in the Ti docs!</li>
<li>Alberto Marcone 2018-12-10

     we're waiting for the fix too, hope this is coming out soon!</li>
<li>Jeroen van Dijk 2018-12-11

     [~jvennemann] is there already an idea if this is going to be fixed in 7.5.1? I don't see anything related in the current milestone on Github yet.</li>
<li>Jan Vennemann 2018-12-11

     Alright guys, here is the latest 7.5.1 build addressing the reoccurring crashes some of you were seeing with 7.5.0.GA.
     
     <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/dwgcxtk5fmwfl41/mobilesdk-7.5.1.v20181211045525-osx.zip?dl=0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.dropbox.com/s/dwgcxtk5fmwfl41/mobilesdk-7.5.1.v20181211045525-osx.zip?dl=0</a>
     
     Please give it a try and let us now how this version works for you. We were seeing positive results in our test case and no more crashes occurred even after several iterations.</li>
<li>Jan Vennemann 2018-12-11

     [~jvandijk], the corresponding PR is <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/10525" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/10525</a> and it was solved together with TIMOB-26452</li>
<li>Jeroen van Dijk 2018-12-13

     [~jvennemann] Looking good so far. Running your test build for 2 days now and haven't seen a freeze myself yet.</li>
<li>Carlos Henrique Zinato 2018-12-20

     Just saw the blog post addressing this issue. I'd like to thank the whole team that worked hard to make it work, especially @Jan Vennemann for his comments and explanations!
     I'm just a little bit confused on what's the best release to use and settings.
     I understand that we should use _run-on-main-thread_ and _use-jscore-framework_ set to *true* but with the blog post about the 7.4.2.GA release and 7.5.1 I'm not sure which one is the recommended version.
     Please correct me if I'm mistaken, but 7.4.2 addresses bugs and issues and this one is included, but 7.5.1 has a lot of improvements, new features and fixes + this one, is that correct?
     Gonna give them a try and let you know!
     Thanks again</li>
<li>Jan Vennemann 2018-12-20

     [~chmiiller], basically you are correct. Except that 7.4.2.GA contains the fixes made for this ticket only, nothing else. 7.5.1.GA also has the fixes made for this ticket along wither other high priority fixes for 7.5.0.GA. And since 7.5.X was a minor update it contains a lot of other new features and fixes compared to the 7.4.X branch as well.</li>
<li>Alberto Marcone 2019-01-30

     I had hoped that everything was fixed, but maybe I found an error connected to this ticket.
     
     When I pause my app with a setInterval running, and then resume it, I get this error (shown as many times as the interval run in the background)
     
     !<a href="https://cdn1.imggmi.com/uploads/2019/1/30/cb2b0b94c4933b97d2c640a18201553f-full.png" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://cdn1.imggmi.com/uploads/2019/1/30/cb2b0b94c4933b97d2c640a18201553f-full.png</a>!
     </li>
<li>Jan Vennemann 2019-01-30

     [~a.marcone], could you please open a separate ticket and post a simple test case? Usually timers will be suspended when the app switches to background and resume once it enters foreground again so they shouldn't fire when app is paused.</li>
<li>Alberto Marcone 2019-01-31

     sorry, I replied to this ticket only because this is happening only after updating to the above mentioned sdk and I never experienced anything like that - especially because the error mentions the JSContext and timer that were the culprit of the issues from other users.</li>
<li>Jan Vennemann 2019-02-28

     [~rmitro], you can use TIMOB-26852 for follow up issues related to JSCore crashes. Please attach the crash log to that ticket and include as much additional info as you can provide. Test cases or full example projects are always a big help for such crashes since they are hard to pin down with just the crash log. Thanks!</li>
