<h3>Description</h3>

We're noticing various seemingly random crashes in our apps on iOS 12. See attached device logs. Issues only occur on physical devices.

I don't have any code to present, it happens "randomly". I've seen various other tickets that are potentially related, but I'm creating this ticket anyway to hopefully create awareness for this issue, our clients starting to notice this which is a big issue for us.

Titanium SDK we're using: 7.1.0.GA, but also tested with 7.2.0, 7.4.0. Same result.
Xcode 9 / 10, no difference.

   I've just installed an app which we didn't update for a while (january 2016), and that seems to work fine (tested on more than 5 iOS12 devices). Not sure what this tells us though. The app is using Titanium SDK 5.1.0.GA.</li>

   Added a log file.</li>

   <use-jscore-framework>false</use-jscore-framework> seems to fix our issue </li>

   btw: Since I've also seen various crashes related to JavaScriptScore, I'm testing my app with this setting too. 
   
   However, this is unlike TIMOB-26391, where I get a random app freeze with nothing useful in logs. 
   
   (My app does make regular use of a setInterval. So, I'm also attempting to fork and update a native timer module for both platforms and see if that helps. <a href="https://github.com/kosso/ti.mely)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/kosso/ti.mely)</a> </li>
