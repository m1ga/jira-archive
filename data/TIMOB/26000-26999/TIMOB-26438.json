I think the best person to ask is [~cbarber] :)",

					"body": "I think it makes sense (given the current code) why it's not picking it up. In the fail case the SDK forking the command only has iOS as a platform, so it can't know about any options/flags defined by android (such as --debug-host), so when it loops over the various command contexts trying to decide what flags should be copied over it will drop the things it doesn't know. Once I build that SDK with Android and iOS, it knows to pass through --debug-host because it now is aware of the flag through Android command context.\r\n\r\nI'm assuming that this was intended behaviour, and that there is reasoning for us not forwarding unknown args, but I can see why we would also want possibly forward unknown args.",

If yes, then add the output where it says forking the correct SDK. If no, then build the SDK with Android, give it a try, and resolve this ticket.",
