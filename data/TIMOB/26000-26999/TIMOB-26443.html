   Hello, I tested your sample code in a sample app. There isn't an issue in my test, The video plays fine. Changing video works fine too. See my video "Videotest.mov". Thanks.</li>

   Hey 
   Can you please test this on iOS 12? With the above configuration?
   It is not crashing on any version of iOS 11.
   As I can see you are running it on iOS 11.2!</li>
<li>shumne 2018-10-04

   Even APM is also reporting this crashing issue on the Appcelerator Performance dashboard only for iOS 12.</li>
<li>Vijay Singh 2018-10-04

   This issue is happening on native iOS as well. I have attached a native iOS app 'TestWebViewApp.zip'. If you run this app on iOS12 and play video, it will crash. This is bug from Apple side. I will file bug to apple for same.</li>
<li>shumne 2018-10-04

   Is there any workaround to resolve this issue? Or do we have to wait for Apple to release another version of iOS/Xcode for this fix?
   Can you please also share the details of the bug you guys are filing to Apple.</li>
<li>Sharif AbuDarda 2018-10-04

   Hello [~shumne], Since it's a native bug from Apple side. We have to wait for support from them. There isn't a workaround besides letting them know about it for faster response. We will let you know if we hardback from them. Thanks.</li>
<li>Vijay Singh 2018-10-05

   [~shumne] You can try to use [Ti.WKWebview](<a href="https://github.com/appcelerator-modules/Ti.WKWebView/releases)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator-modules/Ti.WKWebView/releases)</a> module which uses WebKit framework if it suits to you. I believe this issue should not be there. Thanks!</li>
<li>shumne 2018-10-08

   Hi Vijay,
   I have tried the Ti.WKWebview but it is causing the crashing issue on launch.
   I have tried that example given on the GitHub repo.
   Can you please let help us to get the working code for that module?
   
   Thanks
   Snehal.</li>
<li>Vijay Singh 2018-10-08

   [~shumne] Which version of Ti.WKWebView? I tried with 2.8.3 and it is working fine. I believe you are using code mentioned inside example/app.js. </li>
<li>shumne 2018-10-08

    Hi Vijay,
    Yes it is the same version with the same code. I am running on iOS 12.
    Please find the link of the video.

    Please let me know if I am missing anything.
    Just FYI If I remove the wkwebview related code it is working fine.
    
    Thanks,
    Snehal.

<li>Rakhi Mitro 2018-11-27
