<h3>Description</h3>

Calling Titanium.App.iOS.UserNotificationCenter.getDeliveredNotifications causes 'NSInvalidArgumentException'.
The first line of the stacktrace <code> -[UNNotification content]: unrecognized selector sent to instance</code> points to a type mismatch. The code attempts to get the 'content'  property on UNNotification instead of UNNotificationRequest.
Code should be modified to look like this. I can provide a PR
<code><pre>
 [[UNUserNotificationCenter currentNotificationCenter] getDeliveredNotificationsWithCompletionHandler:^(NSArray<UNNotification *> *notifications) {
        NSMutableArray *result = [NSMutableArray arrayWithCapacity:[notifications count]];

        for (UNNotification *notification in notifications) {
          [result addObject:[self dictionaryWithUserNotificationRequest:[notification request]]];
        }
</pre></code>

   [~rlustemberg] Have you get chance to verify your issue with  SDK 7.4.1 as several notification issues have been fixed in ticket TIMOB-26399? I saw that you were watching that ticket actively. Thanks!</li>

   Hello [~rlustemberg], Can you get back to us after trying on SDK 7.4.1. Thanks.</li>
<li>Richard Lustemberg 2018-10-06

   I think it was not fixed on the PR, but I’ll have a look as soon as I’m at my computer</li>

   Just had a look and the code was not fixed in the PR from TIMOB 26399</li>
<li>Vijay Singh 2018-10-07

   [~rlustemberg] Would you like to provide a PR for same? It would be great. We can review it and merge. Thanks!</li>
<li>Richard Lustemberg 2018-10-07

   I'll take care of that as soon as I'm back home (in about 8 hours from now). The branch for the PR is not in my laptop.
