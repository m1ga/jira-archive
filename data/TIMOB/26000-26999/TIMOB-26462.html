<h3>Description</h3>

I sometimes have to change my internet provider as I have two and sometimes one goes down. Typically this is changing from Virgin ethernet to Talk Talk wi-fi. Obviously the IP address of my machine changes.

When I try and compile after the change with:

$appc ti build -p ios --target simulator ...

I can't because of the error:

[ERROR] Another process is currently bound to port 46032
[ERROR] Set a unique <log-server-port> between 1024 and 65535 in the <ios> section of the tiapp.xml

I have no idea what to set the <log-server-port> value to. One shouldn't have to do this anyway. This is only a relatively recent problem as it didn't used to happen (not sure at which version it changed).

I have tried restarting the simulator, my terminal (quitting processes) and restarting my computer.

   [~icecandyent], thanks for the report. I think it's possible this is similar to TIMOB-25872, where localhost is not resolving as expected. I've seen UK ISPs do similar behaviour before (BT was sniping localhost, and .int domains for me)
   
   Does this only cause issues for you on one ISP? Could you check your <code>/etc/hosts</code> file, there should be some entries like below mapping localhost. If they don't exist could you try adding them and seeing if the issue still occurs?
   
   <code><pre>
   127.0.0.1	localhost
   ::1             localhost
   </pre></code></li>

   Ewan Harris.  Thanks for such a prompt reply.
   
   Yes there was a load of gunk in my /etc/hosts file. Been doing a lot of local web development.
   Setting the localhost values you suggest seems to work. Thanks a bunch.</li>

   Awesome, glad it works. I'll move this ticket over to TIMOB, we really should be erroring with information that can guide you how to fix this issue here.</li>
