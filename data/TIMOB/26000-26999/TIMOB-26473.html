<h3>Description</h3>

I am on 7.4.0GA.

Running this code:
<code><pre>Ti.API.info("displayCaps-platform-H:" + Ti.Platform.displayCaps.platformHeight + ", W:" + Ti.Platform.displayCaps.platformWidth + ", " + Ti.Platform.displayCaps.density);</pre></code>

Returns this for these simulators (iOS 12.0):
iPhone X/XS:      displayCaps-platform-H:812, W:375, xhigh
iPhone 7 Plus:    displayCaps-platform-H:736, W:414, high
iPhone XR:          displayCaps-platform-H:812, W:375, high
iPhone XS Max:  displayCaps-platform-H:812, W:375, xhigh


I believe the XR & XS Max are both incorrect and should instead return:
iPhone XR:          displayCaps-platform-H:896, W:414, high
iPhone XS Max:   displayCaps-platform-H:896, W:414, xhigh

   This issue is also present on 7.4.1GA</li>

   Interesting....
   By simply adding the new splash screens for XR & XS Max, the Ti.Platform APIs are now reporting correctly.
   
   So, the API wont report correctly unless you have the splash screens added.
   
   Shouldn't the platformHeight & platformWidth report correctly regardless ?</li>

   I am on 7.4.1.GA and use launch files, and I am seeing the correct values for displayCaps on XS Max.</li>

   I found this out.  I was on the newest SDK, but I hadn't added the new splash screens.  When the splash screens were missing I got invalid dimensions.  But once I added the missing/new splash screens - then the dimensions reported correctly.
   
   I would have thought the dimensions would be reported correctly whether all splash screens were present or not.....but maybe this is expected!?  IDK.
