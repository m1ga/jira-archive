   I have seen this error a few times - only happens with specific simulators, for me I simply had to delete the simulator and add it again</li>
<li>Kai Lu 2018-10-10

   Thanks David but it is a brand new install of the Xcode. I doubt it was because of a specific simulator. I actually tried a lot of them but all failed the launch.</li>
<li>David van de Meer 2018-10-10

   Have you tried to delete and re-add one?</li>
<li>Kai Lu 2018-10-10

   Hi David,
   
   I don't think that was the issue so I did not try that. Plus I am able to launch the simulator directly from the Xcode and the native project runs just fine.</li>
<li>Sharif AbuDarda 2018-10-14

   Hello, What is the SDK version that you are trying on? Try on the 7.4.1 releases. Thanks.</li>
<li>Kai Lu 2018-10-14

   Thanks Sharif, I have actually tested on both 7.4.0 and 7.5.0. Neither works on mine.
   
   Will give 7.4.1 a shot but not so much hope though.</li>
<li>Kai Lu 2018-10-15

   Just tried 7.4.1, the same issue.</li>
<li>kedomuz 2018-10-22

   Same issue here, latest SDK 7.4.1, OSX High Sierra 10.13.6, nodejs 8.9.4 (via nvm)
   Done fresh install: xcode 10 and appcelerator studio.
   (Simulator from xcode starting normally and xcode native app working, but from studio and cli "Simulator is not available").

   Hello, Can you run a trace log of your build? Run project through terminal. "appc run -p ios -l trace", send the log in here. Also, try with "appc run -p ios -I 12.0" for explicitly selecting iOS SDK 12 when run. Copy the command from here to run. Thanks.</li>
<li>kedomuz 2018-10-23

    Sure! Attached "trace.txt"</li>
<li>Kai Lu 2018-10-23

    Thanks Sharif. I've attached my two trace logs as well. "trace_log" and "trace_log_12_selected".</li>
<li>Sharif AbuDarda 2018-10-24

    Hello, Try deleting the simulator in xCode and reinstall again. Then try from the studio. Thanks.</li>
<li>kedomuz 2018-10-25

    Hello, deleted and added again, not helped,</li>
<li>Josh Lambert 2018-10-29

    Howdy! I'm seeing this same thing. My environment is as follows:
    
    <h4>Node Version: v8.9.4</h4>
    <h4>APPC CLI Version: 7.0.6</h4>
    <h4>APPC SDK Version: 7.4.1.GA</h4>
    <h4>NPM Version: 5.6.0</h4>
    <h4>Titanium CLI Version: 5.1.1</h4>
    <h4>OS Version: 10.14</h4>
    
    I have tried the following things to resolve:
    <h4>Testing using: XCode 9, 10, and 10.1.</h4>
    <h4>Deleting / re-adding simulators.</h4>
    <h4>Restarting computer.</h4>
    <h4>Trying different TiSDK versions.</h4>
    <h4>Re-installing Java, Node, Titanium, Titanium Studio, NPM, etc.</h4>
    
    Nothing working so far. Glad to know I'm not the only one.</li>
<li>Vijay Singh 2018-10-30

    I tried at my end by creating new app and run it, it is launching iOS 12 simulator. I guess it should be something to do with environment.</li>
<li>Samir Mohammed 2018-10-30

    Also unable to reproduce on 7.4.1.GA
    
    *Test Environment*

<li>Kai Lu 2018-10-31

    EULA Accepted             = yes
    
    How can I get an Xcode output of this?
    
    I guess this might be the difference as I never accepted any kind of EULA when I installed the Xcode 10.</li>
<li>Kai Lu 2018-10-31

    Just checked, it's not about the EULA. Problem still there after accepting the license (sudo xcodebuild -license accept).</li>
<li>Kai Lu 2018-11-07

    Is there anyone looking at this issue right now?
    
    We still cannot launch the iOS 12 simulator on Xcode 10 (MacOS 10.13.6). Tried uninstall reinstall the xcode, created a new project, etc. all failed with "Simulator is not available" error message.</li>
<li>Jan Vennemann 2018-11-07

    [~kenjorai], can you run <code>xcrun simctl list devices | grep &lt;UUID&gt;</code> with the simulator UUID in your Titanium build log? For example my output looks like this:
    <code><pre>
    ~/Development/appc/titanium_mobile on master ❱❱❱ appc run -p ios -l trace
    ....
    [TRACE] [ioslib] No iOS Simulator UDID specified, searching for best match
    [TRACE] [ioslib] Scanning Xcodes: 10.1:10B61
    [TRACE] [ioslib] Scanning Xcode 10.1:10B61 sims: 12.1
    [TRACE] [ioslib] No watch app being installed, so picking first Simulator
    [TRACE] [ioslib] Autoselected iOS Simulator: iPhone 7 Plus
    [TRACE] [ioslib]   UDID    = 2A7B0A56-6C58-4CAF-90C1-C359C137752C
    [TRACE] [ioslib]   iOS     = 12.1
    [TRACE] [ioslib] Autoselected Xcode: 10.1
    ...
    </pre></code>
    <code><pre>
    ~/Development/appc/titanium_mobile on master ❱❱❱ xcrun simctl list devices | grep 2A7B0A56-6C58-4CAF-90C1-C359C137752C
        iPhone 7 Plus (2A7B0A56-6C58-4CAF-90C1-C359C137752C) (Shutdown) 
    </pre></code>
    
    What's the state of your selected sim according to <code>simctl</code>? How are you selecting sims? Also compare the UUID of the sim you try to use with Titanium with the UUID of sim you use in Xcode under Window > Devices and Simulators. Either you or the SDK seems to select a Simulator that is not available anymore (probably missing runtime of older iOS version).
    
    To avoid selecting unavailable Simulators you can delete all unavailable with <code>xcrun simctl delete unavailable</code> or individual ones using <code>xcrun simctl delete &lt;UUID&gt;</code>. Please also see this question on StackOverflow: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34910383/xcode-free-to-clear-devices-folder/34914591" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34910383/xcode-free-to-clear-devices-folder/34914591</a></li>
<li>Kai Lu 2018-11-08

    Thanks Jan, I had upgraded to Xcode 10.1 and the simulator (iOS 12.1) is launching now.
    
    Before the upgrade, I tried the "xcrun simctl delete unavailable" which did not work.
    
    Not sure what's been the issue but seems the 10 to 10.1 upgrade and Command_Line_Tools_macOS_10.13_for_Xcode_10.1 (not sure if the command line tools are necessary for the fix) are making the simulator come back again.</li>
<li>Jan Vennemann 2018-11-08

    Yeah, might be the command line tools, the Titanium CLI makes use of them extensively.</li>
<li>Jan Vennemann 2018-11-14

    Alright, resolving this ticket then. Making sure that only valid simulators are available solves this issue. Either by making sure the Xcode environment is up-to-date or deleting any unavailable simulators as described in my comment above.</li>
<li>Léna Faure  2019-10-02

    Hello,
    
    I have exactly the same issue an unwanted upgrade of Xcode to version 11.
    
    The error I get is at the end of the build : "Simulator is not available".
    
    The simulator is showing with commands <code>appc ti info</code> and <code>xcrun simctl list devices</code>, I mention the simulator id for each build with no success.
    
    The app launches fine when installed on the simulator manually.
    
     Here is what I attempted so far :
    
    - Testing with XCode versions 10.1, 10.3 and 11 (with complete uninstall / reinstall)
    - Deleting / re-adding simulators
    - Rebooting computer
    - Trying different TiSDK versions
    - Eventually deinstalling / reinstalling everything (Appcelerator, Xcode, Titanium CLI, etc)
    
    @Josh Lambert @Jan Vennemann, did you eventually find a solution ?</li>
<li>Léna Faure  2019-10-03

    For anyone reading this thread and having the same issue, here are the steps I followed to solve it:
    
    - fully uninstalling xCode, his folders on ~/Library/Developer & /Library/Developer
    - sudo <code>xcode-select -r</code> to reset my xcode-select
    - installing Xcode 10.3 from [<a href="https://developer.apple.com/download/more/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://developer.apple.com/download/more/</a>](<a href="https://developer.apple.com/download/more/)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://developer.apple.com/download/more/)</a>
    - revert to Appcelerator CLI 7.0.10 (or previous version) <code>appc use 7.0.10</code> 
    
    Apparently the bug has to do with the new version of CLI causing trouble for ioslib to connect to the simulators</li>
