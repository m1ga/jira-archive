   [~cbarber], I'm also getting this from time to time. Maybe something in node-ios-device? I'm not getting any useful logs apart from the above error. (Slightly different error code though: 0xe8008001)
   
   Wiping the <code>build</code> folder and then running again solves the issue for me.</li>
<li>Hans Knöchel 2018-11-06

   I get this from current stable versions (e.g. 7.4.1) as well and applying the workaround Jan's describes as well. Would be great to fix! To reproduce:
   1. Deploy an iOS app to device using 7.4.1 and Xcode 10
   2. Change some lines of code in the app
   3. Try to run the app again
   
   Expected: A fast, great Titanium app running on the iOS device
   Actual: The above error code</li>

   Nothing has changed in node-ios-device and since things work, granted intermittently, I doubt the problem is with node-ios-device.
   
   Just out of curiosity, what Node.js version are you using? node-ios-device has not been tested with Node.js 11.x (coming soon).</li>
<li>Hans Knöchel 2018-11-16

   v8.12.0 / v10.13.0 :(. I'd bet on an Xcode 10 thing that changed.</li>
<li>Jan Vennemann 2018-11-16

   Running Node v10.13.0 too. I have two Titanium projects i use for all kinds of testing. One is a classic project, the other is Alloys based. The classic one has this issue every now and then, whereas i have not seen it in the Alloy project yet. Super strange.</li>

   Using Node 8.9.1 and I get this error all the time on the Master branch.</li>
<li>Samuel Haig 2018-11-21

   I also get a failure, even after running <code>appc ti clean</code> and removing the build folder. Using node v8.12.0. Using SDK 8.0.0.v20181031043847</li>

   Getting this issue all the time on master branch, [this issue](<a href="https://github.com/ios-control/ios-deploy/issues/148)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/ios-control/ios-deploy/issues/148)</a> seems to have the same error code and points to a sort of code signing issue? I've attached the full build log from my run.</li>
<li>Ewan Harris 2018-12-03

   Rolling through the builds on the next branch
   
   8.0.0.v20180927131133 - Thu Sep 27, 2018 13:11:33 (/)
   8.0.0.v20181001082706 - Mon Oct 01, 2018 08:27:06 (/)
   8.0.0.v20181002083413 - Tue Oct 02, 2018 08:34:13 (x)
   
   So this looks to have been caused somewhere around the start of October, looking through the history I see <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/10218" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/10218</a> as the PR with the most potential to cause this issue</li>
<li>Ewan Harris 2018-12-03

    Tried using [ios-deploy](<a href="https://github.com/ios-control/ios-deploy)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/ios-control/ios-deploy)</a> in the hope that it gave me a better error. I guess it maybe did, <code>2018-12-03 15:32:44.618 ios-deploy\[80368:1665232\] \[ !! \] Error 0xe800801c: No code signature found. AMDeviceSecureInstallApplication(0, device, url, options, install_callback, 0)</code></li>
<li>Chris Barber 2018-12-03

    <code>TitaniumKit.framework</code> is injected at build time into the generated Xcode project and needs to be signed. This regression was introduced in [PR 10218](<a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/10218)." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/10218).</a>
    
    PR: <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/10505" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/10505</a></li>
<li>Hans Knöchel 2018-12-04

    This is definitely not only 8.0.0+ but also on earlier versions. Though it may be the same reason: We use a lot of dynamic frameworks, which also need to be signed differently. That would also explain why some apps run into it and some not.</li>
<li>Chris Barber 2018-12-04

    [~hknoechel] I don't follow. The issue is with the addition of <code>TitaniumKit.framework</code>, which was introduced into 8.0.0 via PR 10218.
    
    If this issue occurred in the past with dynamic frameworks, then I don't recall hearing about it. Most commonly this error was caused by bad provisioning profile as the error suggests.
    
    On a side note, PR 10218 also broke increment builds. I'll be fixing it in another commit to PR 10505.</li>
<li>Hans Knöchel 2018-12-04

    Please see the previous comments for reference. We are currently seeing this on all kind of Titanium projects using 7.4.1 / 7.5.0 GA builds and valid (non-automatically-signed) provisioning profiles. Not sure if [~jvennemann] also ran into this using < 8.0.0 builds, but I'll for sure try a 8.0.0 build with this flag set as well.</li>
<li>Ewan Harris 2018-12-04

    The 2 error codes mentioned so far appear to represent different things, I think it's best to do the following here
    
    - This ticket is for an 8.0.0 only issue where the TitaniumKit framework is not getting signed causing an app to fail to install to device due to a codesigning issue, throwing error code 0xe800801c. This issue is consistently reproducible
    - A separate ticket is filed for the issue [~hknoechel] is mentioning. [~hknoechel] if you could send me reproducible steps/project on slack I can handle filing and collecting the necessary error logs that for you. It's possibly the same issue [~jvennemann] is seeing with error code 0xe8008001 which looks to represent ["An unknown error"](<a href="https://github.com/ios-control/ios-deploy/issues/292#issuecomment-328091687)." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/ios-control/ios-deploy/issues/292#issuecomment-328091687).</a> This issue is intermittent.</li>
<li>Samir Mohammed 2018-12-19

    Closing ticket, fix verified in SDK Version <code>8.0.0.v20181219044040</code>
