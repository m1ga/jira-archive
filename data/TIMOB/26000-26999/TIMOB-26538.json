		"description": "*Summary:*\r\nIf you start a service and then back out of the app, the JavaScript runtime is kept alive due to the change we've made via [TIMOB-9831] so that the JavaScript service code can still function. The problem with this is if you re-launch the app after doing the above, you'll be stuck at the splash screen and the \"app.js\" won't be re-executed. The reason is because Titanium only supports running 1 JavaScript runtime at a time. And we don't want to start a new JavaScript runtime instance since it wouldn't be able to communicate with the 1st runtime that is running the service... and we don't want the 2nd runtime to start a 2nd service instance.\r\n\r\nThis is a design issue and needs to change.\r\n\r\nWe should revert the change made by [TIMOB-9831] and stop all services when backing out of the app. If an app developer wants a service to keep running when backing out, then they should set up the root window's [exitOnClose|https://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#!/api/Titanium.UI.Window-property-exitOnClose] property to {{false}} so that the UI and service will continue to run in the background as shown in \"Work-Around 1\" down below (or alternatively use \"Work-Around 2\" solution). This also makes the app work more like iOS.\r\n\r\n*Note:*\r\n{{BroadcastReceiver}} has this same issue. If you don't unregister a {{BroadcastReceiver}} before exiting the app, then the next time you launch the app, you'll be stuck at the splash screen.\r\n\r\n*Steps to reproduce:*\r\n# Set up a Classic Titanium app using the below code an XML settings.\r\n# Build and run on Android.\r\n# Press the back button to exit the app.\r\n# Re-launch the app.\r\n# Notice that you're stuck on the splash screen. _(This is the issue.)_\r\n\r\ntiapp.xml\r\n{code:xml}\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\r\n<ti:app xmlns:ti=\"http://ti.appcelerator.org\">\r\n\t<android xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\">\r\n\t\t<services>\r\n\t\t\t<service url=\"Service.js\"/>\r\n\t\t</services>\r\n\t</android>\r\n</ti:app>\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n./Resources/Service.js\r\n{code:javascript}\r\nTi.API.info(\"@@@ Service started.\");\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n./Resources/app.js\r\n{code:javascript}\r\n// Start the service.\r\nvar intent = Ti.Android.createServiceIntent({\r\n\turl: \"Service.js\",\r\n});\r\nTi.Android.startService(intent);\r\n\r\n// Display the main window.\r\nvar window = Ti.UI.createWindow();\r\nwindow.open();\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n*Work-Around 1:*\r\nFor the 1st window you open, set it's [exitOnClose|https://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#!/api/Titanium.UI.Window-property-exitOnClose] property to {{false}} like the below. This prevents the back button from closing your root window and makes the app work more like iOS. It also allows the service to operate in the background without issue. This is the best solution.\r\n{code:javascript}\r\nvar window = Ti.UI.createWindow({\r\n\texitOnClose: false,\r\n});\r\nwindow.open();\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n*Work-Around 2:*\r\nOverride the root window's \"androidback\" event and use an intent to home-out of the app. This is similar to the work-around 1 solution where the root window is not closed and the service will continue to run in the background. Again, this makes your app effectively work like iOS.\r\n{code:javascript}\r\nvar window = Ti.UI.createWindow();\r\nwindow.addEventListener(\"androidback\", function(e) {\r\n\t// If the back key was press, cancel it and go to the home-screen instead.\r\n\tvar intent = Ti.Android.createIntent({\r\n\t\taction: Ti.Android.ACTION_MAIN,\r\n\t});\r\n\tintent.addCategory(Ti.Android.CATEGORY_HOME);\r\n\tintent.setFlags(Ti.Android.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK);\r\n\tTi.Android.currentActivity.startActivity(intent);\r\n});\r\nwindow.open();\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n*Work-Around 3:*\r\nStop the service when the root window is about to close and let everything terminate.\r\n{code:javascript}\r\nvar intent = Ti.Android.createServiceIntent({\r\n\turl: \"Service.js\",\r\n});\r\nTi.Android.startService(intent);\r\n\r\nvar window = Ti.UI.createWindow();\r\nwindow.addEventListener(\"close\", function(e) {\r\n\tTi.Android.stopService(intent);\r\n});\r\nwindow.open();\r\n{code}\r\n",

					"body": "[~jonkravetz],\r\n\r\nHave a look at the summary of this ticket up above. The problem is that Titanium services (it doesn't matter if it's background or foreground) has a design issue. The issue is if you start up a service and back out of the app, then that service would keep the JavaScript runtime alive because it would be useless without it. When you relaunch the app, it'll re-use the same existing JavaScript runtime... but the issue with that is all of the {{require()}} calls won't re-execute your JavaScript files. It'll return their \"cached\" modules instead. And while you may have rigged your app to handle this behavior, for many other app developers this is unexpected behavior. Another issue is that Titanium is tightly bound to the UI and most of our APIs assume that the UI exists when called... because the JavaScript runtime is created when the app UI gets launched.\r\n\r\nSo, the solution in 8.0.0 is to change the behavior to avoid the design issue. As of 8.0.0, services (and broadcast-receivers) are now shut down when exiting the app.\r\n\r\nFor services launched by the UI, the best solution is to set up your \"root\" window's \"exitOnClose\" property to {{false}}. You can see this in the \"Work-Around 1\" example above. When pressing the Back button, it'll end up backgrounding your app's root window instead and keep the JavaScript runtime alive. This is what I recommend. And it definitely works; I've done it. But the key thing is you need to set this property on the \"root\" window (ie: the 1st window you open), not the child windows.\r\n\r\nRegarding 7.5.0, we didn't make any changes to services, but I believe you are running into [TIMOB-26774]. It's caused by the same pre-existing service design issues I've mentioned above... but that ticket's issue can also happen when receiving data intents such as notifications, tapping on URL schemes, etc. That issue was solved in 7.5.1.\r\n",

It's an issue with relaunching the app with the same JavaScript runtime. The 7.4.x and older behavior would re-execute the \"app.js\" in this case (even though it was already loaded before), but all of the required-in JS files would return a cached copy. The re-execution of the same JS file was unintended behavior. The issue with this is that globals defined in the \"app.js\" (particularly for Alloy) would end up being re-initialized and can end up putting the rest of the app in a bad state. In 7.5.1, we restored the old broken behavior of re-executing the \"app.js\" (your app apparently depends on this unintended behavior), but for 8.0.0 we're avoiding this.\r\n\r\n{quote}I don't care about the back button. When you force close the app or restart the phone, it still needs to be running services.{quote}\r\n\r\nEveryone I've worked with was launching services and broadcast-receivers after the app UI was launched, making the new behavior a viable solution (ie: binding the lifetime of the service/broadcast-receiver to the activity). Backgrounding the app's UI (like iOS) is a viable solution in this case.\r\n\r\nThe only way you can get a service to launch without the UI in a Titanium app is if you get a 2nd app to start the service.

If you want to avoid this, then perhaps you should add the [excludeFromRecents |https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/activity-element#exclude] activity XML setting as well?\r\n{code:xml}\r\n<activity android: excludeFromRecents=\"true\" />\r\n{code}\r\n",

					"body": "Hi Joshua,\r\n\r\nI am working on implementing your suggestions but we may decide to roll back to 7.5.2 and ask our customers not to close the app...(or risk running in to intent problems). Is the update to intents being backported? The reason I ask is because I'm thinking other enterprise clients may still be using 7.X and unaware of this new limitation.\r\n\r\nAlso, theoretically would it be possible to allow services and broadcast receivers to continue to run in the background after force closing the app as they were before, and instead, stop/clear and then restart/reinitialize those services and broadcast receivers in a fresh javascript runtime when the app starts up? It seems to me that the problem is not that the services and broadcast receivers are still running, but that the old js runtime conflicts with the new one creating intent issues.\r\n\r\nThe thing is, we've been using android background services for over 2 years that have functioned with the app fully closed. Recently we poured a lot of work in to updating this functionality for API 26 foreground changes. \r\n\r\nI still think that we should really strive to match the native functionality of being able to run background services with the app exited. I don't know the technicalities of how this all works, but it's really important that we are able to continue doing this in a stable and secure manner as we have been.",

Using a GA is clearly out of the question, so now my project is getting less stable with each SDK I'm trying.

					"body": "[~jonkravetz], [~vwalsh],\r\n\r\nI've attached a custom Android module named \"ti.myservice\" (see:  [^ti.myservice.zip] ) which has implements its own Java {{Service}} and {{BroadcastReceiver}} that's work outside of Titanium, but provides a {{MyServiceModule}} which allows the Titanium JavaScript to interact with it however you see fit. The {{BroadcastReceiver}} is set up to listen for the Android bootup event that will start the service. The service doesn't actually do anything, but it has {{//TODO}} comments where you can put your Java code and have it do what you need it to do in the background.\r\n\r\nThe module has a \"build.sh\" script in its root directory, which will only work on Mac/Linux. This script will build the module for you. You can also give that build script a command line argument to your Titanium project directory that you want it to copy the built module to. So, your project will keep its own copy of the built module, which you can then update your \"tiapp.xml\" to reference the \"ti.myservices\" module for Android. This makes it easy to test your service module changes with your.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps.",
