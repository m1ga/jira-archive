<h3>Description</h3>

Our app is not launching when using SDK 8.0.0 with LiveView. It stops after launching the LiveView file server:
<code><pre>
[TRACE] ** BUILD SUCCEEDED **
[INFO]  Finished building the application in 25s 438ms
[LiveView] version 1.2.2
[LiveView] Alloy project monitor started
[INFO]  Launching iOS Simulator
[LiveView] File Server Started on 0.0.0.0:8324
[LiveView] Event Server Started on 0.0.0.0:8323
</pre></code>

This is happening on both iOS and Android (Windows untested so far).

   [~hknoechel], I'm having no issues myself connecting to the liveview server.
   
   Could you please edit <code><sdk path>/node_modules/liveview/hook/lvhook.js</code> to add <code>child.stderr.pipe(process.stderr);</code> after <code>child.stdout.pipe(process.stdout);</code> and then run with <code>DEBUG=liveview:*</code>. 
   
   I don't suppose you still have a path to a custom liveview hook setup in ti config do you? That's unsupported and we have patched the liveview distributed via studio to not run when using SDK 8</li>

   I'm going to close this as cannot reproduce, based off the error logs it looks very similar to when a global install of liveview and a local install of liveview are fighting, nothing project specific</li>
