See the [corresponding issue on the socket.io repo|https://github.com/socketio/socket.io/issues/1590], dating back to 2014, with *41 comments* and thus making it the *third issue by comments number* in the repo. At the time the maintainer of {{superagent}} was [willing to accept|https://github.com/visionmedia/superagent/issues/529#issuecomment-75417508] an extension for Titanium SDK but I personally never got to the stage to make a PR because I found too many problems on offering a reliable API to developers.\r\n\r\n_*Please note:* I’ve not been part of the Titanium community for a long time, the aforementioned issues could have been solved in the meanwhile. Sorry if that’s the case._",
