   [~kmahalingam] I tried at my end using 8.0.0 but it is working fine for me.
   Is this issue happening to other people as well?
   What Xcode version you are using?
   
   I can see an old Jira ticket TIMOB-25079 (fixed) with same error message. But it was related to hyperloop.

   [~vijaysingh]  yes, I checked with [~lchoudhary].he is also getting it. Xcode version im using is Xcode 10.0

<li>Vijay Singh 2018-11-22

   I am using Xcode 10.1 and it is working fine. [~jvennemann] [~gmathews] any suggestion?</li>
<li>Jan Vennemann 2018-11-22

   Please post a complete log with trace log level. That way we can see the actual error that caused the linker to fail.</li>

   As per log com.soasta.touchtest module is giving problem. Discussed with [~kmahalingam] and she verified by removing that module, it is building successfully. </li>

   We need to provide a new iOS module that contains X86_64 slices:

   With SDK 7.5.0.GA it is working fine. It is failing on SDK 8.0.0.
   [~gmathews] Is there any way we can rebuild Soasta module? 
   I can not see any iOS target file. Even the Soasta documentation link mentioned in README is also broken.</li>
<li>Vijay Singh 2018-12-11

   We do not have source code of Soasta module. So we are unable to build.
   Removing it out of 8.0.0. </li>
