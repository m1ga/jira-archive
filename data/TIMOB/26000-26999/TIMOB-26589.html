<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Description</h4>

Customers are seeing an issue when using SDK 7.4.1 on android (we have seen the issue using a Google Pixel 1 with Android 8.1), when they install the app the appicon appears smaller than it should and round, but when they compile with the SDK 7.0.2 the icons display as they should. Attached screenshot.

If they add the next line in the tiapp.xml file the icons displays with the right size and shape: 
<uses-sdk android:minSdkVersion=“23” android:targetSdkVersion=“25" /> 
But Google Play will require that new apps target at least Android 8.0 (API level 26) from August 1, 2018, and that app updates target Android 8.0 from November 1.

<h4>Reproduce</h4>
1. Download test app from following link, which basically a brand new Alloy app with customer's app icon. (<a href="https://propelics.box.com/s/a78x4kli780wxbf3bfstuvalitc90luw" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://propelics.box.com/s/a78x4kli780wxbf3bfstuvalitc90luw</a> )
2. Run the app to Google Pixels 1 device.

<h4>Note</h4>
We tested this in support team, but seem not able to reproduce the problem. However, we do not have Google Pixels devices. 

Please check and provide some advice.

   For Android 8 and above Google has introduced Adaptive icons:
   <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/ui_guidelines/icon_design_adaptive" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/ui_guidelines/icon_design_adaptive</a>
   This is the reason they look round and smaller.</li>
<li>Joshua Quick 2018-12-03

   Right. This isn't a bug because Android 8.0 and higher defaults to masking app icons within a circle now.
   
   The reason the icon is smaller is because the app icon has a white round bordered square and the OS is shrinking it to fit within the circle. You may want to consider changing the icon's white square to a white circle so that it won't be downscaled as much. Or alternatively, implement a "roundIcon" as that Yordan provided a link to.</li>
