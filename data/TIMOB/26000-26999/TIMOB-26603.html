<h3>Description</h3>

I'm attempting to run  projects  containing Hyperloop code directly on XCode, in order to debug native modules or run Instruments.
As soon as Hyperloop code is invoked a script error is shown:

{noformat}
Script Error {
    column = 26;
    line = 7;
    message = "Can't find variable: Hyperloop";
    sourceURL = ..., etc
}
{noformat}
What am I missing?

   Great that this has moved along the pipeline. I was about to make a comment to bump it. 
   The source url of the stacktrace is any of the js stubs created by the hyperloop build. When the project is run from XCode, the Hyperloop global is unavailable.
   If a project has a combination of native modules and hyperloop, not being able to run it from within XCode makes it impossible to do module development on the same project where there is hyperloop code.</li>
