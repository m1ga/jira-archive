<h3>Description</h3>

Use case: We want to run some code first before closing the window without creating a custom back-button which is not easy to create exactly looking button as native iOS provides on a Window.

In Android, we can add a custom method to <code>onHomeIconItemSelected</code> for the up-arrow icon to call our custom method where we can even close the window.

In iOS: We cannot call any method upon clicking the back-button of Window where we can run some validations before closing the window. 

Current Solution: Create left-nav button with a back arrow icon and set click event listener to it. This is not a proper way as the padding, size, back-icon are very hard to match as provided by native iOS Window itself. So we should add similar property or override iOS back-button click event. See attached screenshot for clear understanding.

   Hi, I couldn't find native docs on this much as but I did find some hacks on Google. Since I'm not a native iOS guy, so could you please refer to your iOS team to look into this as I believe they can confirm on this?</li>
