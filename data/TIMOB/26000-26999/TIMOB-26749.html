<h3>Description</h3>

We recently updated to SDK and LiveView 1.4.2 and noticed that LiveView does not work (= does not launch Simulator) anymore. Log:
<code><pre>
[TRACE] ** BUILD SUCCEEDED **
[INFO]  Finished building the application in 1m 7s 303ms
[LiveView] version 1.4.2
[LiveView] Alloy project monitor started
[LiveView] File Server Started on 0.0.0.0:8324
[LiveView] Event Server Started on 0.0.0.0:8323
</pre></code>
The project is already shared with the Appc team, so it can be reproduced there.

   I can't reproduce this issue. Me and 2 other people here (3 separate machines) are able to launch the iOS Simulator and Android emulator via LiveView 1.4.2 just fine. We've done it via the CLIL (v7.0.9) and via Appcelerator Studio.
   
   Is this just a simulator/emulator launch issue for you?
   If you launch the simulator/emulator yourself, is LiveView able to function from then on?</li>

   I'm going to close this as cannot reproduce, based off the error logs it looks very similar to when a global install of liveview and a local install of liveview are fighting, nothing project specific</li>
