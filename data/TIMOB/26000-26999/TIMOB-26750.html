   [~hknoechel] I wouldn't class this as a bug, node-ios-device is being initialised twice because of the forking of the SDK. The first you're seeing is during the 7.5.0.GA setup, the second is during the 8.0.0 build. AFAIK there's no possible reuse we can do there because the two versions might not be API compatible </li>

   I don't know. As a developer, I would expect the tooling to be streamlined here. But if it's not possible, guess this can be resolved.</li>

   We can't safely do this as the two instances come from different SDKs and we can't assume that the node-ios-device in a different SDK is compatible</li>
