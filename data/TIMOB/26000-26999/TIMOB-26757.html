<h3>Description</h3>

Currently, Android does not offer a way to check and request permissions to access the photo gallery. It seems like it's a similar permission to access the camera, but for the sake of parity and less platform-specific code, it could be added.

   On Android, you don't need permission to select an image from the gallery. This is because the selected image is returned indirectly via a content provider. I've re-tested this on an Android P device and it's true.
   
   You only need permission to *add* images to the gallery, which is something the camera APIs already effectively offer.
   
   Although, for the sake of parity, I suppose we could hardcode these methods to return true. I suppose that's what you're after, right?</li>

   Yep, that's what I thought. If I remember correctly, some kind of API for some other permission returns a hardcoded "true" already, so that concept wouldn't be new. It's really just an effort to minimize the "if-else" cases.</li>
