Because that will simply terminate the app. When you start up the app afterwards, it'll start up fine because it's a cold start.\r\n\r\nAnd I can kill the app via Android's task manager and restart the app just fine too. This works fine because it's doing a cold start too.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you are referring to tapping the exception dialog's \"Continue\" button? If you do that, then you may be continuing the app's JavaScript or Java side is in a broken state.",

This typically only happens if there is an issue with a Java module.\r\n\r\nFor example, the \"ti.facebook\" module will throw an exception on app startup if you haven't added your app ID to the \"AndroidManifest.xml\" and \"strings.xml\". This exception occurs within Facebook's library (they did it on purpose and works like a C/C++ assert).",

					"body": "The error handling can definitely be made better. I think it's great that we now display a stack trace error dialog. That was a huge improvement. But right, it can still be made better.\r\n\r\nTitanium just needs a try/catch block in the right places in our {{onCreate()}} methods to better catch exceptions and handle it more gracefully. Because since the app's UI is in a broken state, we're unable to show an error dialog. You have to look at the log instead. This is what you're seeing, right?\r\n\r\nThe only error handling we can't handle gracefully are things that are loaded by the Android OS. Such as an activity or service in your AndroidManifest.xml that doesn't exist in Java. Things like that we're kind of screwed on, but it's no worse than it is for Android devs that go full native either.",
