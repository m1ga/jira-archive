<h3>Description</h3>

This one is no regression and was likely never considered as a bug, but it's quite simple: When re-building an iOS app - even without any change, the build takes like 20seconds. Ruffly 10 seconds of that are caused by a "build state check" that validated *every* single file to see if it changed, causing thousands of logs in larger projects like ours.

A simple way to fix this would be to not check every file, but curate a blacklist of changed files that can be compared (like with a hash). If I remember correctly, something very similar is already done for Hyperloop right now.

Example of this log:
<code><pre>
[TRACE] No change, skipping /Users/hans/Documents/dev/myapp/myapp-titanium/build/iphone/build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/MyApp.app/node_modules/date-fns/is_today/index.js
</pre></code>

Only partly related: The same can be applied to Alloy, where the "alloy compile" command is executed on every incremental build, even if no files change. There is a command for conditional Alloy compiling which LiveView also use, so Alloy should make use of it internally as well.
