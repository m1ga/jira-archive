		"description": "This one is no regression and was likely never considered as a bug, but it's quite simple: When re-building an iOS app - even without any change, the build takes like 20seconds. Ruffly 10 seconds of that are caused by a \"build state check\" that validated *every* single file to see if it changed, causing thousands of logs in larger projects like ours.\r\n\r\nA simple way to fix this would be to not check every file, but curate a blacklist of changed files that can be compared (like with a hash). If I remember correctly, something very similar is already done for Hyperloop right now.\r\n\r\nExample of this log:\r\n{code}\r\n[TRACE] No change, skipping /Users/hans/Documents/dev/myapp/myapp-titanium/build/iphone/build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/MyApp.app/node_modules/date-fns/is_today/index.js\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nOnly partly related: The same can be applied to Alloy, where the \"alloy compile\" command is executed on every incremental build, even if no files change. There is a command for conditional Alloy compiling which LiveView also use, so Alloy should make use of it internally as well.",
