<h3>Description</h3>

Latest error message on LiveView issue with 8.0.0 TIMOB-25072 shows that we might need to gracefully close TCP connection just before application exit - sample code: <a href="https://gist.github.com/infosia/a4d617b6678a5efef445eb7301b8b4c2#file-liveview-diff-L54" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://gist.github.com/infosia/a4d617b6678a5efef445eb7301b8b4c2#file-liveview-diff-L54</a> I think this has never happened on iOS/Android/WindowsPhone because application lifetime is totally controlled by each frameworks...but it seems things are different for Windows Store app because user can explicitly kill the app manually by pressing Window's [x] button. I don't know why this has never happened on previous versions but maybe we need to handle this natively, like explicitly closes all open-connection gracefully just before application exit.

*Steps to reproduce*

<code>appc run -p windows -l trace --target ws-local --liveview -l trace</code> and then exit the app by pressing [x] button on the title bar

*Result*

<code><pre>
[INFO]  Disconnected from app
-- End application log -------------------------------------------------------

2019-01-31T07:12:35.322Z | ERROR  | An uncaught exception was thrown!
read ECONNRESET
2019-01-31T07:12:35.322Z | ERROR  | read ECONNRESET
</pre></code>

*Expexted*

<code>read ECONNRESET</code> error message does not happen
