   Now that I think about it, we already do support margins.
   
   If you set a view's "width" property, then its "left" and "right" properties will act as margins.
   If you set a view's "height" property, then its "top" and "bottom" properties will act as margins.
   
   For example, the below will set up an auto-sized label with a margin of "5dp" around it. Note that it's important that you set the width and height to <code>Ti.UI.SIZE</code> or else the top/bottom/left/right properties will be used to size the view instead via our pinning feature.
   <code><pre>
   var label = Ti.UI.createLabel({
   	text: "My Margin Test",
   	width: Ti.UI.SIZE,
   	height: Ti.UI.SIZE,
   	top: "5dp",
   	bottom: "5dp",
   	left: "5dp",
   	right: "5dp",
   });
   </pre></code>
   
   [~bhouse], what do you think?</li>

   The problem is that setting the size to Ti.UI.SIZE isn't always possible.    For example, if you are trying to create a gridview w/ tiles .  You might want each one to be a certain width/height.    I've been able to work around it w/ embedded views but I usually have one embedded view for margin and and second embedded view for padding.</li>

   It'll work for your case too. As long as you set the "width" and "height" properties to a value of some kind, then the top/bottom/left/right properties will act as margins. This works on all platforms (Android, iOS, and Windows).</li>

   cool!  let me try it out.  Maybe we can add a helper property called margin that sets the top,bottom,left, and right.  </li>
