		"description": "Until SDK 7.5.X one could open the Xcode project from a device build ({{-T device}}) and simply run it via Xcode. This was very useful for easy native debugging of both the SDK core and natives modules.\r\n\r\nSince SDK 8.0.0 this is now failing due to the core-js polyfills which are added to the app outside of our usual JS processing and thus are not part of the encrypted JS assets.\r\n\r\nApart from the issue mentioned in this tickets this may also have a negative performance impact since i would assume loading the polyfills from the encrypted assets is probably faster then loading them all from file.\r\n\r\n*EDIT:* With latest master the issues with polyfills were resolved. Only the {{__index__.json}} used to resolve require paths is still required.\r\n\r\nAs a workaround the following build phase can be added to the Xcode project which copies the required files into the app bundle:\r\n{code}\r\ncp ${SRCROOT}/build/Products/Debug-iphoneos/${CONTENTS_FOLDER_PATH}/_index_.json ${BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR}/${CONTENTS_FOLDER_PATH}/_index_.json\r\n{code}\r\n",

I open the Xcode project and try to run it and it blows up with \"Could not find the file ti.main.js\".\r\n\r\nAfter doing some testing, I determined Xcode uses a system DerivedData directory to build the app. This directory is outside the Titanium project and thus does not have any of the Titanium resources.\r\n\r\nTo fix the Derived Data directory issue, you must open Xcode Preferences, go to the \"Locations\" tab, then set the \"Derived Data\" path to be \"Relative\" and a value of \"DerivedData\". This will put all intermediate files in the \"build/iphone/DerivedData\" directory. Next you need to click the \"Advanced...\" button under the Derived Data field to open the build location window. Select the \"Custom\" option with \"Relative to Workspace\". Set the \"Products\" path to \"Build/Products\" and the \"Intermediates\" path to \"Build/Intermediates.noindex\". Click the \"Done\" button and close the preferences.\r\n\r\nNow you can build your iOS app and will will run. BUT, don't clean the project! That will wipe all files in the \"build/iphone/build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/appname.app\" directory and then you're back at the \"Could not find the file ti.main.js\" error.\r\n\r\nI recommend we research changing the iOS build so that it copies/processes files from the Resources directory into a \"build/iphone/Resources\" directory instead of \"build/iphone/build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/appname.app\". Then add each of those Resources files to the Xcode project as static files that are copied to the final app output directory. This will allow you to clean, re-build, distribute, and natively debug an app without issue.",

					"body": "[~cwilliams], yes this is still an issue, precisely because of what [~cbarber] wrote. When you open the project in Xcode it will use a different derived data directory. The command above copies the _index_.json from the derived data directory our command line build uses to the one when you build directly from within Xcode. As you already noted, that's also the reason it fails when you try to hack our iOS CLI because both dest/src are the same in our command line build.\r\n\r\n[~cbarber], your proposed solution is exactly what i had in mind too. We probably \"just\" have to refactor [copyResources|https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/blob/f63e597adfc21c4aac6894234b2c92bee4c5a593/iphone/cli/commands/_build.js#L4895] so that it copies all resources to this new destination and then add this as a folder reference to the Xcode project. That way we don't have to manage each and every file reference in the project. Xcode should then just copy it during the \"Copy Bundle Resources\" phase.\r\n\r\nAs an intermediate solution we could start with the {{_index_.json}} and, instead of writing it directly into the Xcode directory, write it into a temp folder and then let Xcode copy it. That way users should be able to run a device build directly from Xcode (since JS resources are encrypted and don't need to be copied).",
