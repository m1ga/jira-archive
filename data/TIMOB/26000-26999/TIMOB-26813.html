<h3>Description</h3>

I've noticed that once Hyperloop is enabled in a project, only the js class stubs appear available in the Webkit debugger. I think this issue is critical for Hyperloop adoption as without debugging any advantage of using Hyperloop instead of native modules is lost.

   Hello [~rlustemberg], can you share a sample project that demonstrates the issue that you mentioned? We will look into it. Thanks.</li>

   Hi Sharif, I've uploaded a screenshot of the debugger and here I'm pasting the repo of an example app. The hyperloop examples app should exhibit the same behaviour, but I cannot test because of an issue I have with hyperloop+cocoapods

   I've renamed the bug. It's actually an sdk issue starting on 7.5.x.
   Debugging works correctly on 7.4.2.GA</li>

   I can verify that the issue still exists on sdk 8.0.0.GA. It's not possible to debug using the Webkit Inspector. Only sources for ti.main.js are exposed

   This seems legit and has likely been caused by the bootstrap changes of 7.5.0 (cc [~jquick]).</li>

   @hknoechel , I was about to run a diff between 7.4 & 7.5 to try to figure this out. I'm very eager to start using sdk 8 but can't lose the ability  to debug.</li>
