We noticed some random JSCore crashes in latest SDK 8 builds (not sure if also happening on < SDK 8 since we already updated to 8 a while ago). One of the crash logs attached.

   [~amukherjee] [~lchoudhary] Can you check this one.. </li>
<li>Hans Knöchel 2019-02-27

   I just attached another crash log.</li>
<li>Hans Knöchel 2019-03-01

   [~jvennemann] You now have access to all out crashlogs reported via Firebase.</li>
<li>Jan Vennemann 2019-03-12

   [~rmitro], please share the following build with users that report this issue. It contains a possible fix for this issue. Due to lack of reproducible test cases we depend on customer feedback here.

   The changes have been applied but it is still crashing in some occurrences. [~amukherjee] [~jvennemann] Please escalate this asap, this is really a SDK 8 update blocker.</li>
<li>Hans Knöchel 2019-03-30

   Unfortunately even the latest fixes could not fix the crashes, although it seems to become more stable now. I hope more core-devs can be allocated to eliminate this.</li>
<li>Abir Mukherjee 2019-04-01

   Returning this ticket to "In Progress"</li>
<li>Abir Mukherjee 2019-04-03

   [~lchoudhary], [~vijaysingh] can you also please help with the debug?</li>
<li>Hans Knöchel 2019-04-08

    This issue causes another possible crash in native modules (see [here](<a href="https://github.com/AndreaVitale/av.imageview/issues/72)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/AndreaVitale/av.imageview/issues/72)</a> for reference). To reproduce it in our app, we used an iPhone 6 (device, not Simulator. Simulator does not crash at all). You are free to create stuff in our app to trigger it.
    
    The reason why this is not reported too many tines so far is that probably not many users moved to 8.0.0 already. If I could guess, I would now pinpoint it to be related to firing events that cause a bad access / race condition inside JSCore. We now have 20+  unique crash reports for this. Please get more staff on this.</li>
<li>Jan Vennemann 2019-04-12

    Pushed an updated fix to the PR.
    
    [~smohammed], can you test this again with the project provided by Hans? Thanks!</li>
<li>Hans Knöchel 2019-04-16

    Added one more crash occurring after the latest changes from [~jvennemann].</li>
<li>Hans Knöchel 2019-04-17

    Guys, you cannot be serious moving this ticket to 8.1.0. Every app using 8.0.0 is affected by this and there is no workaround available. Please finally more staff on this to resolve this.
    
    Edit: Thanks for the clarification and active efforts, I hope the team will find a solution soon.</li>
<li>Abir Mukherjee 2019-04-17

    [~hknoechel] I just sent you email. We can do a 8.0.2 immediately after we get the fix for this.</li>
<li>Daniel Levine 2019-04-24

    I believe I am also experiencing this issue with my app (support told me about this Jira issue).  The app was using 7.x SDK (not sure which, perhaps 7.5) on iOS 10.1.x.  Seemed to break when app iOS was updated to 10.2, but wasn't able to verify because my devices are all 10.2.  Updated to use SDK 8, but didn't seem to change it.  Crash on my app only happens on real hardware (simulator is fine, so same as this issue).  It seems like once my app gets running, it's good to go.  However, the crash is like 8 out of 10.  Will try to upload my crashlog.
    
    Edit: I don't see how to upload my crashlog in chrome on my Mac. :-/  <More...> doesn't give me an option to attach anything.</li>
<li>Jan Vennemann 2019-04-25

    [~dlevine], if you can't upload directly to JIRA you can also share a link to the crash report via Dropbox, Google Drive or similar.</li>
<li>Jan Vennemann 2019-04-29

    [~vijaysingh] this can now be reviewed again.</li>
<li>Brian Knorr 2019-04-29

    We are seeing a ton of crashes in JavaScriptCore in our client's apps as well because of the upgrade to 8.0.  We are now considering downgrading to 7.5 unless a fix can be provided very soon.  Here is a link to an example crash report...we get hundreds of these a day.  <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1pw6M3CzpJf53X2RSlmliUSlJdaAEAWSW" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1pw6M3CzpJf53X2RSlmliUSlJdaAEAWSW</a></li>
<li>Jan Vennemann 2019-04-29

    Please test the following pre-release build of 8.0.1 that includes a fix: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/eidzetqd0z7cmv0/mobilesdk-8.0.1.v20190429083235-osx.zip?dl=0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.dropbox.com/s/eidzetqd0z7cmv0/mobilesdk-8.0.1.v20190429083235-osx.zip?dl=0</a>
    
    Please note that due to a tight schedule this fix might be postponed to 8.0.2 in a final release. However, this will follow shortly after the 8.0.1.GA.</li>
<li>Brian Knorr 2019-04-30

    @Jan Vennemann - your link to the pre-release build requires a username/password.</li>
<li>Jan Vennemann 2019-04-30

    [~btknorr], sorry, try again. I've updated the link!</li>
<li>Daniel Levine 2019-04-30

    I'd love to see if this resolves my issue, but I'm not quite sure how I would install this in my Studio build process.  I'm on a Mac.</li>
<li>Jan Vennemann 2019-04-30

    [~dlevine], just download the zip and run <code>ti sdk install &lt;zip-file-path&gt;</code>. You should now be able to select this version in Studio.</li>
<li>Daniel Levine 2019-04-30

    Ok got it.  For completeness, I needed to run:
    <code>appc ti sdk install &lt;zip-file-path&gt;</code>
    
    Nice job guys! This build resolves my crashing problem.  Can't wait for 8.0.2. ;-)</li>
<li>Hans Knöchel 2019-05-03

    We even see some crashes in the current pull request state, but those may be different kind of leaks. [~jvennemann] is informed about those.</li>
<li>Samir Mohammed 2019-05-09

    FR Passed, Waiting on Jenkins to merge. </li>
<li>Hans Knöchel 2019-05-09

    [~smohammed] I heard of more people still having crashes in regards to memory usage over time, so I think this is not finished, yet.</li>
<li>Jan Vennemann 2019-05-09

    [~hknoechel], we don't want do postpone 8.0.1 any longer so we will merge the current fixes. This is still being worked on and any additional fixes will be released in 8.0.2.</li>
<li>Samir Mohammed 2019-05-13

    [~jvennemann] Feel free to reopen for any additional fixes for 8.0.2 or create a new ticket for the additional fixes. </li>
<li>Abir Mukherjee 2019-05-22

    Reopening to allow further PR's for this ticket.</li>
