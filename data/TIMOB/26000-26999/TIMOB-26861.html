<h3>Description</h3>

There are multiple issues with logging from native modules.

*ObjC modules*
The module template uses <code>DebugLog</code> by default. This is a macro that only logs when <code>DEBUG</code> is defined. However, a module is always built with the "Release" configuration which does not has <code>DEBUG</code> defined. It is enabled in the "Debug" configuration but there is no way to select that during module build. The only way to enable it is to define <code>DEBUG</code> in the Release configuration which would defeat the purpose of two different configurations.

<code>NSLog</code> works as expected in ObjC modules.

*Swift modules*
In Swift modules no logging works at all. Neither <code>debugPrint</code>, <code>print</code> nor <code>NSLog</code> print anything to the logs. This is somewhat expected for <code>debugPrint</code> and <code>print</code> since they only work with the Xcode debugger log.

For <code>NSLog</code> however, the only way to get any logs is to check the Console app where log messages will appear. The default Titanium device/simulator log doesn't contain any logging made from within a Swift module with <code>NSLog</code>.

[~cbarber] you are familiar with our logging, any idea why no logs appear from Swift modules?

   If you prefix the log with <code>[DEBUG]</code>, <code>[TRACE]</code>, <code>[INFO]</code>, <code>[WARN]</code> or <code>[ERROR]</code> it will be displayed. The logger system expects those. Would be cool to pump Swift's <code>debugLog</code> to <code>DEBUG</code> directly.</li>

   Nope, even that won't make logs appear in Swift modules. I tested all day with another module issue and the only way i could see logs from within Swift modules was to check through the Console app.
   
   I guess it has something to do with our redefinition of <code>NSLog</code> which won't be picked up by Swift.
   
   Also, there is another side effect which i suspect to be related to redefining NSLog: All output from NSLog made in third-party frameworks is completely gone. I noticed this when working with Localytics in Hyperloop. You can enable [logging](<a href="https://docs.localytics.com/dev/ios.html#troubleshooting-ios)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://docs.localytics.com/dev/ios.html#troubleshooting-ios)</a> in Localytics but won't see any logging at all, neither to the Console app nor in our Titanium log server.
   
   I'll add some reproducible code snippets when i have time.</li>

   Good to know and  good to be resolved! It definitely works for ObjC modules as you described, so the ticket name may include "Swift" as well.</li>

   Any news on this? or any kind of workaround?</li>
