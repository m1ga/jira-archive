<h3>Description</h3>

With SDK 8.0.0 we now support writing native module with Swift. This is great, however, there are a few regressions in the developing experience compared to ObjC modules.

Since we don't have any Swift source files in our core yet the Swift standard libraries are not embedded by default and it needs to be done explicitly right now to support third-party frameworks. This is currently done through a simple [hook](<a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/blob/e15980ad3066fa6d50abb6ddb7ce725cd9659759/iphone/templates/module/swift/template/ios/hooks/ti.swiftsupport.js)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/blob/e15980ad3066fa6d50abb6ddb7ce725cd9659759/iphone/templates/module/swift/template/ios/hooks/ti.swiftsupport.js)</a> for both Swift native modules as well as Hyperloop.

Now, the requirement for this hook prevents quick testing of module changes by building a module and then launching the example. Running <code>ti build -p ios</code> will crash the example on startup because the above hook is not active when doing this workflow. Users currently have to do a build only run with <code>ti build -p ios -b</code>, then extract and copy the module into a test app to verify changes. This a time consuming task and needs to be improved.
