<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Description</h4>

In TIMOB-26869 it was confusing as the error log stated LiveView but it wasn't actually related to LiveView, something like this could (and probably has) waste dev cycles debugging an error in the wrong place. LiveView attaches an uncaughtException handler here <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/liveview/blob/099cc1a0fc8870853db279274121cab65ca01aae/lib/fserver.js#L505" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/liveview/blob/099cc1a0fc8870853db279274121cab65ca01aae/lib/fserver.js#L505</a>, now that we're no longer spawning the server this is attaching onto the main process and claiming errors from the build scripts

   When this is changed need to investigate the this doesn't cause errors to be hidden from a user, it might be that we need to move this handler up to titanium</li>
