<h3>Description</h3>

Following are the steps to produce the issue.
1. Install the Hub from the Android play store.
2. Configure Hub using VMware credential.
3. If You have any other setting to configure the Android Enterprise we can use that.
4. Once the configuration is completed it will create a separate workspace profile which includes the Android Enterprise Play Store. 
5. Download any Appcelerator application from Workspace.
6. Open the app.
7. It does not show a splash screen while opening.

   Hello [~shumne],
   
   Can you please provide more detail about your problem?
   
   1. Please correct me if I am wrong. Your apps are working well with splash screen during development or download from other app stores, and this problem only happens when you try to download and open it from Android enterprise work play store? 
   
   2. if #i is yes, can you please provide a simple example we can test?  or can you please provide some screenshots or short video about how you reproduce the problem, like what the app store looks like, how you install Hub?
   
   3. Have you try a newly created test app for this process, see if you can see the same problem.
   
   Please get back to us on this either in here or in the salesforce ticket. 
   
   Regards,
   AppC Support

   I doubt this is a Titanium issue.
   
   Titanium sets the splash via the main launcher activity's "windowBackground" style in XML, which is the standard way of handling it on Android. The Android OS displays the "windowBackground" on app startup before any of the app's native code gets executed. It works similarly to an iOS "default.png". Meaning Titanium does *not* display the splash, the OS is supposed to do it.
   
   But in this case, the app is being launched by Android Enterprise within a sandboxed environment and it's ignore the "windowBackground" image. So, this is really an issue with Android Enterprise.</li>
