<h3>Description</h3>

One of our technology customers is using a module we built for them that utilizes foreground-services (7.3.0+) and the location provider API to record geolocations and it seems to randomly fail:

{quote}
In the foreground, the tracking on all devices under Android 7 and Android 8 delivered sufficiently accurate results. On a Galaxy S5 under Android 6 no geo data could be recorded. If the app is running in the background, the results are very different. On Huawai Devices, the Foreground service is often terminated - this happens very differently, sometimes after 16 minutes, sometimes even for the first time.
after 50 min. A Google Pixel 2 with Android 8 behaved similarly. The least problem with the Foreground service seems to be on Galaxy devices.

We hope this can be resolved by some fine tuning.

   The following community module attempts to keep the app alive by having the Android <code>AlarmManager</code> poll it at regular intervals (as I stated above in my last paragraph above). This should work, but spawning a wake-lock every interval via the <code>AlarmManager</code> is frowned upon... unless your app "really" needs it.
