<h3>Description</h3>

This encompasses both the Titanium CLI, and some refactoring of the Alloy CLI. Apologies to the various devs who help me craft this. Please edit as you see fit.

We create some form of titanium amplify cli extension that handles things like service enablement, crash/tiapp metadata uploading on build, premium module updating on new/build, and abstracts the whole separate alloy install away

* To buy time for doing it right and get it done sooner could try and produce a wrapper package that contains titanium cli, alloy and and appc-cli-titanium.next package that would emulate the existing behaviour of the appc cli and how it works with hooks
* We could "do the right thing" from the start and migrate to the way things want to be done (daemon)

We need cross team discussions/effort I imagine (appc-platform-sdk does the heavy lifting for requests in appc-cli-titanium, but is incompatible with the new auth flow. There is a suggestion we could do it quickly with just bearer token support in appc-platform-sdk).
