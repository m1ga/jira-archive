<h3>Description</h3>

if I try to run the following command:

<code><pre>
appc run --platform ios --target simulator --log-level info --liveview --project-dir myProject --device-id deviceid
</pre></code>

I have different processes

<code><pre>

therefore I get the spamming log:

<code><pre>

This started happening only lately.

   Hello, I can verify this also in an Android device (9.0) using the 8.0.0.GA SDK. The log keeps showing the "Address in use, retrying..." but liveview works fine. [~a.marcone], did liveview works for you when you make changes to the code and save the file? Thanks.</li>
<li>Alberto Marcone 2019-05-06

   Yes, live view works, but the console log is flooded by those messages and it’s unusable. </li>
<li>Alberto Marcone 2019-05-07

   This is happening on different computers with different configurations. Switching back to 7.5.x didn't make any difference. It's only been happening for the past week or so.</li>
<li>Sharif AbuDarda 2019-05-07

   Hello, What is your studio version? </li>
<li>Alberto Marcone 2019-05-07

   I haven’t used Studio for a while. This happens even if I simply run it from the command line.</li>
<li>Rodolfo Perottoni 2019-05-10

   Can confirm this issue when using LiveView. Console won't stop printing "Address in use, retrying...".</li>
<li>Sandro Lain 2019-05-10

   Hello!
   I confirm the presence of the problem after upgrading to SDK 8.0.0.GA, running on the iOS Simulator from Visual Studio Code with "axway.vscode-titanium" extension.
   
   Making changes, liveview executes the loading of a long list of files, and after the refresh of the app an "Invalid type passed to function" error occurs</li>
<li>Alberto Marcone 2019-05-13

   any workaround on this? reading through the logs is unbearable, plus the app is refreshed multiple times and it crashes after a few updates.</li>
<li>Alberto Marcone 2019-05-22

   could anyone give us an update on this ticket? *any* workaround if a solution is not on the way?</li>
<li>Alberto Marcone 2019-06-19

    I updated everything to the latest: Appcelerator Studio version 5.1.2.201903111843 , Titanium CLI 7.0.11, Ti SDK 8.1.0.
    
    It's still giving the same error. This is driving us insane, we can't update to the latest sdk version and we're still stuck with Ti SDK 7.x. It's not only one workstation but all of the workstations in the company. It's ridiculous that we don't get an update AT ALL.</li>
<li>Eric Merriman  2019-09-20

    Hello [~a.marcone] I'll ask the team to take at look at this one. I'll let you know if we need any additional info to reproduce.</li>
<li>Alan Hutton 2019-09-20

    Hello [~emerriman] [~a.marcone]
    
    Looking at the log, there are two versions of liveview installed. It looks like there is a globally installed liveview that's fighting against the SDK installed liveview
    
    <code><pre>
    *[LiveView] version 1.5.0*
    [LiveView] Alloy project monitor started
    [INFO]  Launching iOS Simulator
    [LiveView] File Server Started on 0.0.0.0:8324
    [LiveView] Event Server Started on 0.0.0.0:8323
    * [LiveView]  version 1.2.2*
     [LiveView]  Alloy project monitor started
    </pre></code>
    
    Should be able to correct this issue by [sudo] npm uninstall liveview -g and then use the liveview distributed in the SDK as of 8.0.0.GA.
    
    Please let me know if this solves your issue.
    </li>
<li>Alberto Marcone 2019-09-24

    thank you, this shed light on what was going on.. It wasn't a global package, but I looked for all the /bin/liveview and removed them. Now it looks like it's working! thank you!
