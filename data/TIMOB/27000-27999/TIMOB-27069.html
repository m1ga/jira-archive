<li>Rakhi Mitro 2018-12-26

   [~sonufana4u],
   We are working into this. We will update you soon.</li>
<li>sonufana4u 2018-12-27

   @Rakhi - Have you checked the issue at your end ?</li>
<li>Rakhi Mitro 2018-12-27

   [~sonufana4u],

<li>Fazlul Haque 2018-12-27

    Hello [~sonufana4u],
    
    I have tested your project on my end and cannot complete the steps because of your  pincode. I have tried all of these 6880 or 1333 or 0433 or 9482 but all are invalid. Please check the screenshot. !IMG_5068.PNG|thumbnail! 
    
    Thanks</li>
<li>sonufana4u 2018-12-27

    Ok..Am giving some more pin code.. Basically your to give username & password then from picker you need to select school devtest2 and you need to select class and click on done..Hope you are doing the same...
    
    Pins - 3626,3012,4532,2287
    Let me know if that doesn't work..
    Thanks</li>
<li>Fazlul Haque 2018-12-27

    Hi [~sonufana4u],
    
    Now I can test using your new Pins. I am sharing you my test report and workaround for your issue.
    
    1) I have tested your provided project on my end on following environment:
    Appcelerator Command-Line Interface, version 7.0.9
    SDK version: 7.5.0.GA
     Test Device: iOS 12.1 enabled iPhone device
    
    And I can reproduce the crash issue using your project *without changing anything on your code*.
    
    Also I have noticed that on your tiapp.xml file you have blocked the the following code:
    <code><pre>&lt;property name="run-on-main-thread" type="bool"&gt;true&lt;/property&gt;</pre></code>
    
    Please enable this code and test your project on ti SDK version 7.5.0.GA and I hope the issue will be resolved. I have tested after changing this code and I did not reproduce the crash. The project is working file.
    
    *Steps which I followed:*
    1) Run your provided project on iOS 12.1 enabled iPhone device
    2) Login using your provided username and password
    3) Then from picker I selected the school *devtest2* and  select the class and click on done
    4) Tried several time and doing different things by following your provided video.
    
    Cannot reproduce the issue.
    
    Thanks

    Hello Fazlul,
    Thanks for your reply.
    
    Actually i tried with this option also but i was getting crashing issue.However i didn't clean the build after doing the changes..
    
    
    {noformat}
    <property name="run-on-main-thread" type="bool">true</property>
    {noformat}
    
    
    Also, am using Appcelerator Command-Line Interface, version 7.0.6..Does it affect to causing the issue?
    
    Let me try with again by cleaning the build and test it..I'll update you on the same..
    
    Thanks.

<li>Fazlul Haque 2018-12-28

    Hello [~sonufana4u], That means there is no any issue on your iPhone after changing the code on your tiapp.xml file. Am I right? Thanks</li>
<li>sonufana4u 2018-12-28

    So far it seems to be working fine..Will test more on iPhone and let you know..
    
    But please check your mail and test on iPAD (Landscape) dashboard feed section..

    Hello [~sonufana4u], I am not sure how can I reproduce it as an issue on my end. As its working perfectly on iPad simulator (check the screenshot on named Screenshot_iPad.png ). I have used your full test project which you sent on email. I have just change the tiapp.xml file and added the above mention code. If you think its an our platform issue then please share us a simple test code where we can reproduce the issue. Thanks</li>

    [~sonufana4u] Thanks for the update. After testing the steps above on an ipad mini 3 (11.4) and iPhone 6S plus (12.0 Beta). I was only able to experience one crash and that was on the Iphone when entering the pin code. (Spent 15 minutes on each device trying to reproduce).

<li>sonufana4u 2019-01-07

    Thanks Samir for the time spent.
    
    Yes we also get crashing when we use 15-20 minutes..And it happens random.Doesn't get any crash log in console.
    
    Last time it was told to me to add below line tiapp.xml..So, after that it reduces but not vanished.
    
    {noformat}
    <property name="run-on-main-thread" type="bool">true</property>
    {noformat}
    
    Let me know what went wrong and how to resolve that since client is asking for updates.
    
    
    Thanks Again.</li>
<li>sonufana4u 2019-01-07

    You said that you experienced crash when entering the pin code..But try to test the profile section also as described in the video.Thanks </li>
<li>sonufana4u 2019-01-08

    Hello,
    
    So, how to fix those random crashes..?Please let me know.
    
    Thanks</li>
<li>sonufana4u 2019-01-09

    Hello Guys,
    
    Any suggestion or update on this.Can we prevent crashes ?
    
    Thanks</li>
<li>sonufana4u 2019-01-10

    Hello Guys,
    
    Is anyone looking into this random crashes issue ? I need to fix this.Please let me know where it is causing the issue.
    Thanks
    </li>
<li>sonufana4u 2019-01-11

    Hello Guys,
    
    Today i was testing the application and it got crashed 4 times..Please help me to fix this issue.Its very urgent..
    Thanks.</li>
<li>Jan Vennemann 2019-01-24

    [~sonufana4u], could you please test with the latest build from 7_5_X branch? You can install it with
    <code><pre>
    appc ti sdk install -b 7_5_X
    </pre></code>
    
    We recently merged a fix that addresses memory leaks in timers. Since your crash reports indicate frequent crashes in timer callbacks this might be related.</li>
<li>sonufana4u 2019-01-25

    Hello Jan,
    Thanks for your reply.
    
    Currently Am already using 7.5.0GA and i also tested on 7.5.1RC but in this SDK sometimes App freezes..
    
    So, i did some memory leakage changes at the code level and monitoring it..Though it subsides but still it has random crashes.
    
    Thanks.</li>
<li>Jan Vennemann 2019-01-31

    [~sonufana4u], if you continue to see issues with the latest build from 7_5_X (download with <code>ti sdk install -b 7_5_X</code>) please shoot me an email with your updated project and crash logs.</li>
<li>sonufana4u 2019-02-07

    Hey Jan,
