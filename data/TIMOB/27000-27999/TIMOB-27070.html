<h3>Description</h3>

*The Issue:*
Currently, Titanium does not have an API to detect if there are any registered activities that can be started for a given intent. An app developer's only option is to call Titanium's [startActivity()](<a href="https://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#</a>!/api/Titanium.Android.Activity-method-startActivity) method and see if it throws an exception or not. This is an issue for apps that need to detect this in advance without launching an activity.

*Solution:*
Add a new <code>canStartActivity(Intent)</code> method to <code>Ti.Android.Activity</code> which will return <code>true</code> if at least 1 activity was found for the given intent.

Internally, this should call Google's [PackageManager.resolveActivity()](<a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/pm/PackageManager.html#resolveActivity(android.content.Intent" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/pm/PackageManager.html#resolveActivity(android.content.Intent</a>,%20int)) method, where if it returns a non-null reference, then we know an activity exists for the given intent. Alternatively, we could call Google's [PackageManager.queryIntentActivities()](<a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/pm/PackageManager.html#queryIntentActivities(android.content.Intent" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/pm/PackageManager.html#queryIntentActivities(android.content.Intent</a>,%20int)) method which returns a list of activities matching the given intent, where we could check if at least 1 activity was returned.

*Use-Case:*
Can be used to detect if there is a 3rd party app installed for viewing a file, such as PDF. If <code>canStartActivity()</code> returns <code>false</code>, then you can alert the end-user that viewer app needs to be installed.

*Note:*
While it would be more powerful to provide a <code>queryIntentActivities()</code> method in Titanium, the vast majority of app developers simply want to know if at least 1 activity exists. So, it's better to keep it simple for now. The only good use-case I've heard where you want to scrutinize the activity list is when you want to exclude an activity from a particular app that has known issues.
