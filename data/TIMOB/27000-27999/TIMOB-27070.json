		"description": "*The Issue:*\r\nCurrently, Titanium does not have an API to detect if there are any registered activities that can be started for a given intent. An app developer's only option is to call Titanium's [startActivity()|https://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#!/api/Titanium.Android.Activity-method-startActivity] method and see if it throws an exception or not. This is an issue for apps that need to detect this in advance without launching an activity.\r\n\r\n*Solution:*\r\nAdd a new {{canStartActivity(Intent)}} method to {{Ti.Android.Activity}} which will return {{true}} if at least 1 activity was found for the given intent.\r\n\r\nInternally, this should call Google's [PackageManager.resolveActivity()|https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/pm/PackageManager.html#resolveActivity(android.content.Intent,%20int)] method, where if it returns a non-null reference, then we know an activity exists for the given intent. Alternatively, we could call Google's [PackageManager.queryIntentActivities()|https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/pm/PackageManager.html#queryIntentActivities(android.content.Intent,%20int)] method which returns a list of activities matching the given intent, where we could check if at least 1 activity was returned.\r\n\r\n*Use-Case:*\r\nCan be used to detect if there is a 3rd party app installed for viewing a file, such as PDF. If {{canStartActivity()}} returns {{false}}, then you can alert the end-user that viewer app needs to be installed.\r\n\r\n*Note:*\r\nWhile it would be more powerful to provide a {{queryIntentActivities()}} method in Titanium, the vast majority of app developers simply want to know if at least 1 activity exists. So, it's better to keep it simple for now. The only good use-case I've heard where you want to scrutinize the activity list is when you want to exclude an activity from a particular app that has known issues.",
