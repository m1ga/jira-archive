<h3>Description</h3>

The following settings don't work on Android, using TabBar style bottom, new in Ti 8.0

This is problematic when the background is white, then you can't see the tabs, because the color of the png isn't being preserved.  Also, for some reason it doesn't load the "activeIcon" when it's selected.

<code><pre>

'TabGroup[platform=android]': {
	style: Ti.UI.Android.TABS_STYLE_BOTTOM_NAVIGATION,
//	tabsBackgroundColor: "transparent" // -doesn't work-  Update: it works.
	tabsBackgroundColor: "#fff" // does work, but stinks because icons are white
}

'Tab': {
	activeTitleColor: "#164660",
	activeIconIsMask: false,  // doesn't work on android
	iconIsMask: false,           // doesn't work on android
}
</pre></code>

   I want to also point out, in the screenshots, that on Android, the activeIcon setting is not being applied.</li>
<li>amdolan 2019-03-14

   I think this might be a new feature request, and not a bug, given that the bottom tab bar is new in 8.0.</li>

   [~amdolan],
   
   Thanks for raising this. Can you please explain more? It would be great if you can share a sample test issue to reproduce the problematic issue on our end.</li>
<li>amdolan 2019-03-21

   Sure thing - see attached project - I created an alloy project and this is the entire zip of the app/
   
   I created this project with Ti 8.0.0GA
   
   Quick correction: I have updated the issue description regarding transparent background color.  Still, the icon masks seem to be a pretty big issue for my use case. You can see in action if you change over to transparent from white in <code>app/styles/app.tss</code>
   <code><pre>
   tabsBackgroundColor: "transparent" // Update: this does work!
   </pre></code>
   
   So I'm still having issues with activeIcon on android - and activeIconIsMask and iconIsMask.  Thanks!

   I just want to reiterate; the docs describe the correct behaviors, that these settings are not implemented for Android. No bugs here, just lack of feature parity, if that makes sense.</li>

   Hello [~amdolan], Can you share the native Android guide link of how this it is handled in there? Thanks.</li>

   [~amdolan],
   
   Can you please test this issue on sdk 8.0.0.v20190104153150 and let us know how it goes? To install this SDK open terminal and execute the following: 
   <code><pre>
   appc ti sdk install 8.0.0.v20190104153150
   </pre></code></li>
<li>amdolan 2019-03-22

   </li>
<li>amdolan 2019-03-28

    Thought I should link these two issues somehow., 
    
    Edit: I don't see any relationship added, I tried to link this issue: TIMOB-26734</li>
