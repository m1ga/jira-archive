<h3>Description</h3>

In our application we have a composite view that shares models/collections across many sub views.  We also like to utilize data binding wherever possible, however this presents a bit of a challenge.  We can only bind to Collections and Models defined in the XML markup, and we cannot replace those Collections/Models with shared references across each sub controller.  It appears today our only option is to use a singleton Collection/Model which is not ideal if you need multiple instances of Collections/Models to be accessed across multiple view bindings.  If setting the Collection/Model inside the sub controller is not an option perhaps we could introduce a method of passing a reference to the Collection/Model in the createController statement.

   Hello, can you share some native guide or docs link on how this is handled natively? or a similar native equivalent of the Alloy data building in the native environment. Thanks.</li>
