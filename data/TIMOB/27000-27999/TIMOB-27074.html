<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Steps to reproduce:</h4>
1. Create a default app.
2. Build for IOS simulator.
3. After app launch, rebuild the app for the same simulator, without quitting the current simulator.

<h4>Actual results:</h4>
1. The build fails with :
<code><pre>
[DEBUG] :  Log server port 28544 is in use, testing if it's the app we're building
[ERROR] :  Another process is currently bound to port 28544
[ERROR] :  Set a unique <log-server-port> between 1024 and 65535 in the <ios> section of the tiapp.xml
</pre></code>
2. Works fine after quitting the emulator & then rebuilding.

<h4>Expected result:</h4>
1. The build should not fail.

   I also run into this from time to time. [~cbarber], i remember killing stale node processes solved this for me, so maybe the log server sometimes doesn't quit properly? Not 100% sure, i'll check again when i run into this next time.</li>

   [~cbarber], i did some testing and this happens when the app is put in the background. When you bring it to the foreground it works again. Updated testing steps are:
   
   <h4>Build and launch app on Simulator</h4>
   <h4>Put the app in the background </h4>
   <h4>Rebuild and see the error happening</h4>
   <h4>Bring the app to foreground, do another rebuild and everything works again</h4></li>

   After having a quick call with [~jvennemann] and doing some tests, [we think] we figured out the problem!
   
   Node's <code>net.connect()</code> has a <code>timeout</code> option and it's an *activity* timeout, not a *connection* timeout. So, even if you receive data, it will still timeout.

   FR passed on Master, waiting on Jenkins build and a back-port for 8_1_X.</li>

   Did a manual rebase and merge to master (had to fix some lint issues and re-work the commit message). Then cherry-picked to 8_1_X.</li>
