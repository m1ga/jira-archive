<h3>Description</h3>

I noticed this behavior in one of my own apps and tested it in another separate simple app where it also showed up. 

In the docs, the validatesSecureCertificate property of the HTTPClient is stated to default to false in development (simulator) and test (device) deployment types. Android's behavior with this property is as described, however on iOS the property is undefined in both development and test deployment types.

Either the docs are inaccurately describing the correct behavior or this is indeed a bug.

   Hello,
   Thanks for reaching out! Can you please test the issue on latest SDK? Open terminal and type: *appc ti sdk install latest*
   Do you have a simple test project to demonstrate what you are trying?

   Sure thing! I targeted the 8.0.0.GA SDK and tested against that but the same behavior is still cropping up.
   
   I've attached the sample project. Ignore the name and what not, it's from a prior resolved ticket. There are a couple console logs showing the http client's property discrepancy.</li>

   That's indeed an issue. iOS does not assign a default value. However, internally it will be handled correctly as false so it shouldn't have any negative effects. Moving to TIMOB. </li>
