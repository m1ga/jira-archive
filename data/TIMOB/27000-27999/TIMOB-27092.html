<h3>Description</h3>

After updating to latest master, the Window transitions on Android seem to be broken. Before, the underlaying activities would pop up from bottom to top and now they seem to fade. Please restore the default (native) behavior.

   It seems like adding the following setting nearly restores the default behavior, but it still looks a bit different. Also, hardcoding this is bad practice in case the OS changes it's transitions between versions.
   
   <code><pre>
   activityEnterTransition: Ti.UI.Android.TRANSITION_SLIDE_BOTTOM
   </pre></code></li>

   (y) yep, bring back the native transition please.</li>

   It's not technically broken. It still animates, but it's defaulting to a fade-in animation instead and I can understand why a breaking-change like this would be unwanted. A separate ticket has been made here [TIMOB-27101] to address this in Titanium 8.0.2.
   
   *FYI:* What's really happening is that it's doing a "shared-element" activity transition animation by default instead. It's a negative consequence of the change made via [TIMOB-25678] which allows app devs to use the shared-element transition properties such as "activityEnterTransition" without ever having to call <code>addSharedElement()</code>... instead of the older <code>open()</code> method's "activityEnterAnimation" and "activityExitAnimation" properties. The shared-element transition properties offer more animation options versus the other method is much more limited.

   [~hknoechel], I've noticed that the "activityEnterTransition" slide animation is a bit janky too. The slide animation is overlapping the top status bar and bottom navigation bar. I've modified the PR in [TIMOB-27101] to handle this better. It actually looks pretty nice now.</li>

   Closing as duplicate.
   This issue will be resolved in 8.0.2 via [TIMOB-27101].</li>
