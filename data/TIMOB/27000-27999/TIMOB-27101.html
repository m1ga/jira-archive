<h3>Description</h3>

*Summary:*
As of Titanium 8.0.1, a <code>Window.open()</code> method call is opening with a fade-in animation instead of the system default animation (typically slides-up). What's happening is that the window is doing a "shared-element" animation instead, which is mostly intended to show a view moving from one window to another.

This regression was caused by [TIMOB-25678] which was intended to allow app developers to use the shared-element transition animation properties such as "activityEnterTransition" without having to set up any views as shared-elements via <code>Window.addSharedElement()</code>. This was meant to be more convenient to use than the <code>Window.open()</code> method's "activityEnterAnimation" and "activityExitAnimation" properties. The negative consequence of this change was that it was always defaulting to shared-element transition animations even if none of the transition properties were assigned.

*Steps to reproduce:*
<h4>Build and run the below code on Android.</h4>
<h4>Tap on the "Open" button to open a child window.</h4>

<code><pre>
var windowCount = 0;
function openWindow() {
	windowCount++;
	var window = Ti.UI.createWindow({
		title: "Window " + windowCount,
	});
	var openButton = Ti.UI.createButton({ title: "Open" });
	openButton.addEventListener("click", function() {
		openWindow();
		window.close();
	});
	window.add(openButton);
	window.open();
}
openWindow();
</pre></code>

*Result:*
After pressing the "Open" button, it looks like the app fades to the Android system's home screen and then the app's child window fades-in.

*Expected Result:*
Child window should open with a slide-in animation instead.

   Verified the Fix on SDK 8.0.2.v20190605070127 and 8.1.0.v20190606063903. Windows transition works as expected.
