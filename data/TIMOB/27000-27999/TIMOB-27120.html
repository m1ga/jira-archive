   [~hknoechel],
   
   What's happening in your app is that a white child window is quickly opening and closing on startup. When that child window closes, it's bringing you back to the splash screen which can happen if you call it's <code>close()</code> method while its "exitOnClose" property is set <code>false</code> (this is the correct behavior). Once that white child window closes, your app then opens the main <code>TabGroup</code> window.
   
   None of my other apps have this behavior. Are you sure you're not quickly opening/closing a window on startup somewhere? Such as your login or intro windows?</li>

   Sorry for the late reply. No we don't - there is only a TabGroup opening. And even for non-logged-in states (e.g. log in) it flickers. Even if I comment out all logic in our index.js and add a <code>Ti.UI.createWindow().open()</code> it flickers.
   
   *EDIT*: Oh dear...It was a <code>Ti.UI.backgroundColor = 'xxxxx'</code> causing the issues. No idea where that regression came from, but removing it fixes all flickering.</li>

   Thanks for narrowing it down [~hknoechel].
   
   Setting the <code>Ti.UI.backgrounColor</code> property (or <code>Ti.UI.backgroundImage</code>) will replace the root window's splash screen image. I do know that there is a bug on Google's end where opening a child window while the splash is in mid-transition will restart the existing transition on cold start (see: [TIMOB-27328]). This sounds like a similar issue where replacing the root drawable is triggering an invalidation/request-layout which in turn is restarting the activity transition animation.
   
   The problem is how to work-around it. How we worked-around it in [TIMOB-27328] was to call the Java <code>overridePendingTransition()</code> method, but that only works when called immediately after <code>startActivity()</code>. I don't really have a solution for this particular issue at the moment... other than to avoid it entirely and don't set the <code>Ti.UI.backgroundColor</code> property.</li>
