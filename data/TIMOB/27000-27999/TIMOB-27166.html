<h3>Description</h3>

When we minify projects we explicitly turned off two options in the minified: "mangling" and "dead code elimination".

The first renames variables to shorter names.

The second removes chunks of code that should not be reached.

We turned both of these off to "fix" TIMOB-25573, but I believe that we should revisit and see if this is still an issue. Ideally we'd try to turn these options back on, especially since we'd like to move more aggressive optimizations from Alloy into the SDK core build for inlining true/false for platform/deploy type/distribution variables/guards.
