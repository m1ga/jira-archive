		"description": "Related to TIMOB-26352 because both would take advantage of npm and node_modules in the root directory of the project.   \r\n\r\nSpecifically for native modules, the directories would not get copied to Resources directory like normal commonjs Titanium packages but would instead get \"installed\" by copying to the modules directory and modifying the {{tiapp.xml file}} to add those modules to the app.\r\n\r\nOne way of doing this would be to add a \"titanium\" property to the {{package.json}} of the npm package that contains the native modules.  \r\n\r\nPossibly something like this:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{code:java}\r\n\r\n  \"titanium\": {\r\n    \"nativeModules\": true\r\n  }\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I don't know that our tooling will see that and enforce it especially when looking at an app that may have multiple installs under the node_modules folder\r\n- We do not yet publish any of our native modules to npm. We need to modify our Jenkins builds to support it\r\n- When we do publish them, should we do so under a scoped name like `@titanium`, `@appcelerator`, `@appcelerator-modules`?\r\n- There's duplication of effort on the user's point in that just installing a native module through npm does not modify the tiapp.xml for them - they need to add it there themselves and make sure the versions match up. Maybe we can do some magic in some npm script hook that'd run post install and do it for them?\r\n- Our native modules with multiple platforms often have wildly varying versions between the Ones. What do we publish the npm package as? The higher of the two? Publish separate packages for each platform?\r\n- The npm package name and the module id do not have to match. Do we want to begin moving that way?",
