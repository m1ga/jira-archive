<h3>Description</h3>

I have Xcode 11 beta2 and 10.2.1 installed. Xcode 10.2.1 is selected.

If I run <code>ti build -p ios</code> it will bomb out saying no Xcode's supporting iOS 13.0.

Ultimately, it looks the code to auto-select the iOS SDK version when unspecified is not always sorting the Xcode's to prefer to selected one. Specifically if a 2 member array, the custom sort only checks the second Xcode to see if it's selected, not the first. This can result in it not getting "priority" and Xcode's get sorted by version instead (preferring Xcode 11 and iOS 13)

   Thanks for this! I was to file the same ticket just now. </li>

   This fixed the issue for myself locally, and was a relatively small change so I merged to get past the issue. QE will likely want to double-confirm/FR it...</li>

   [~cwilliams] With Xcode 11 beta 3 installed and having Xcode 10.2.1 selected whenever I try build to iOS 13 I get the following error: (I get the same error if I have Xcode 11 beta 3 selected and try to run a iOS 12.2 emulator (all other emulators work fine)).
   <code><pre>
   [ERROR]  Unable to find any Xcode installations that support both iOS 12.2 and iOS Simulator F44E31CA-0C60-4226-8C41-8BD67EAE0CEF.
   Build failed. Process exited with code 1.
   </pre></code>
   Is this intended or should it auto select the correct Xcode version? 
   
   SDK Version <code>8.1.0.v20190715143102</code>, <code>8.2.0.v20190712143331</code> and  <code>8.0.3.v20190711103731</code>.</li>

   [~smohammed] sounds like a separate issue to me? It seems to be picking up that you have Xcode 10.2.1 selected as it reports trying to match iOS 12.2. But I'm guessing that sim ID must be from Xcode 11 beta 3/ iOS 13? We probably want to file a ticket for this - basically it looks to be auto-selecting an iOS 13 sim in your case to try and match. Presumably it should pick a sim from the selected Xcode to try and match up.</li>
