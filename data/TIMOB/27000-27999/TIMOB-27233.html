<h3>Description</h3>

Titanium has 3 essential CLI's: Appc CLI, Titanium CLI, and Alloy CLI.

The Appc CLI and Alloy CLI will be deprecated. The Titanium CLI will be re-imagined to include the platform specific functionality in Appc CLI as an add-on and Alloy CLI as a Titanium CLI command.

As apart of this effort, the following CLI's and compabilities will be deprecated:

<h4>Titanium CLI</h4>

* End of support for Node 8 and older
** TIMOB-27250
** Effective Titanium SDK 9
** Node 12 being the recommended
** Node 10.13.0 being the minimum supported (though the actual technical minimum is 10.2.0)
** Notice added to Titanium CLI v5 and displayed only if Node version < 10.2

* End of support for non-build,clean Titanium CLI (v5.x or older) plugins
** Effective Titanium SDK 10
** Plugins must be ported to Appc Daemon plugins and new hook system

* End of support for ALL Titanium CLI (v5.x or older)
** Effective Titanium SDK 11
** Notice added to Titanium CLI for specific commands when output is text (not JSON)
** NON-BUILD plugins must be ported to Appc Daemon plugins
** Note: build-related plugins must be continue to be written as Titanium CLI v5 plugins

* End of support for <code>ti setup</code>, <code>ti module</code>, and <code>ti plugin</code> commands?
** Effective Titanium SDK 10
** Notice added to Titanium CLI v5 for these commands when output is text (not JSON)
** Command will not likely be replaced in Titanium CLI v6

<h4>Appc CLI</h4>

* End of Life for Appc CLI
** Effective Appc CLI 9
** End of Support sometime in 2020, possibly around Titanium SDK 10... notify to switch to Titanium CLI v6

   * <code>Commands will not be replaced in Titanium CLI v6</code> - this is kinda wrong for <code>ti module</code> right? Don't we have the info buried in the titanium plugin somewhere, so I think we wanna point people there?
   
   * <code>End of Life for the Alloy CLI - Basically EOL today anyways</code> - Used by Studio as well as the editor plugins for a variety of interactions. Also should EOL and EOS be switched? How can we still support something that's been EOL'd</li>

   To my knowledge, nothing calls <code>ti module</code> and <code>ti plugin</code> because A) they don't provide much useful information and B) were never completed. Those commands were intended to list, install, and remove modules/plugins (e.g. a scoped package manager).
   
   Studio and plugins that call the Appc CLI will be in the same boat as those that call Alloy. They will all need to be updated.
   
   I agree the EOS vs EOL is confusing. I pulled the terminology from Microsoft and they've never been wrong before. :)</li>

   We have decided to announce this for now in the 9.0.0 SDK release notes.
   
   We will add more deprecation notices in the various CLI's as apart of TIMOB-27255 once we fully design the replacement hook system and a migration plan.</li>
