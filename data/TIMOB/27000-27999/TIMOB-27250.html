   There is some uncertainty as to where/how this will be done (I thought the belief was a warning in the appcelerator cli but I could be wrong), we can move this ticket if needed.
   
   My belief is we will want to log this out from the appc cli we will want to apply this restriction to the appc cli also. 
   
   However there is some uncertainty as to whether this is just restricted to people running commands from Titanium SDK 8 (I would say this warning is relevant to _anyone_ using Titanium as I would imagine someday they'll have to use SDK 9 so it should be output always)
   
   There is also uncertainty as to when to output it i.e only on certain commands (I would say we output this always to increase the frequency of people seeing it)
   
   I think if Titanium SDK 7.5.2 (our only supported SDK in the 7.X line) works with Node 10, we should output all the time on every command either from the Titanium CLI or the Appcelerator CLI.
   
   
   I guess cc [~cbarber] [~cwilliams] and [~emerriman] for some clarification</li>

   After giving this some thought, I don't think we need to add a Node.js deprecation warning to the CLI. It complicates which CLI, which commands, which output method, which SDK, etc that the warning should be displayed.
   
   Instead, I propose the following:
   
   <h4>Create a generic mechanism in the Titanium CLI (not the Appc CLI) that reads the SDK's <code>package.json</code> and validate the current Node.js version against the <code>"engine"</code> Node version. If the check fails, then the command (build/clean/create/project) errors with a useful error message.</h4>
   <h4>Put the actual Node.js 8.x deprecation notice in the next CLI(s) and SDK release notes AND a dedicated blog post</h4>
   ** Appc CLI 7.1.0, Titanium CLI 5.x, and Titanium SDK 8.1.0 release notes state that SDK 9 will require Node 10 (though technically 8.12) or newer</li>

   merged to 8_1_X and master branches</li>
