<h3>Description</h3>

It is working fine in 8.0.0 but not in 8.0.1
in 8.0.1 it return "Dialog activity is destroyed, unable to show dialog with message: null"

so here the case
1. i have 1 component of alert dialog with android view which used in multiple page of screen
2. when i show the alert dialog in first screen it works fine
3. when i show the same alert dialog in second screen, the alertdialog not showing, but instead it's on the first screen (when i close the second page, i saw the alert dialog in 1st page)
4. in first page when i try to show the same alertdialog, it return error "Dialog activity is destroyed, unable to show dialog with message: null"

Workaround for this  issue
1. Keep re-creating new alertdialog unlike previous approach which using 1 alertdialog and used in multiple places.

   Hi ! 
   Thanks for reporting the issue. Can you please try using latest ti sdk 8.0.2.GA and check if you experience the same? You can download the sdk using this command: *appc ti sdk install 8.0.2.GA* 
   Let us know the update.</li>

   I can reproduce this issue in Titanium 8.0.1 and above with the following code...
   <code><pre>
   var dialog = Ti.UI.createAlertDialog({
   	title: "Alert Dialog",
   	message: "This is the alert message.",
   	buttonNames: ["OK", "Cancel"],
   	cancel: 1,
   });
   
   var window = Ti.UI.createWindow();
   var button = Ti.UI.createButton({ title: "Show Alert" });
   button.addEventListener("click", function(e) {
   	var childWindow = Ti.UI.createWindow({ title: "Child Window" });
   	childWindow.addEventListener("open", function() {
   		function dialogEventHandler() {
   			dialog.removeEventListener("click", dialogEventHandler);
   			dialog.removeEventListener("cancel", dialogEventHandler);
   			childWindow.close();
   		}
   		dialog.addEventListener("click", dialogEventHandler);
   		dialog.addEventListener("cancel", dialogEventHandler);
   		dialog.show();
   	});
   	childWindow.open();
   });
   window.add(button);
   window.open();
   </pre></code>
   
   This is likely due to the changes we've made to [TIMOB-26978], where there were known rare crashes with <code>AlertDialog</code> and <code>ProgressIndicator</code> dialog when showing/hiding them from a destroyed activity window. Especially if Android's "Don't keep activities" developer option was turned on. A native Android dialog is designed to be attached to a single activity window and it can internally throw a Java exception on Google's end when showing/hiding it from a destroyed activity. 
   
   We'll re-look into this. On iOS, a dialog is always shown on top of the app and is not bound to any window. I think we need to look into better replicating this behavior on Android without the above mentioned exceptions that can happen.
   
   In the meantime, I recommend that you re-create the alert dialog like you're doing now.
   _(Natively, I think that's our only option as well to get the same effect.)_
   
   Thanks for bringing this issue to our attention.</li>
