<h3>Description</h3>

With Xcode 11 beta 3 installed and having Xcode 10.2.1 selected whenever I try build to iOS 13 I get the following error: (I get the same error if I have Xcode 11 beta 3 selected and try to run a iOS 12.2 emulator (all other emulators work fine)).

<code><pre>
[ERROR]  Unable to find any Xcode installations that support both iOS 12.2 and iOS Simulator F44E31CA-0C60-4226-8C41-8BD67EAE0CEF.
Build failed. Process exited with code 1.
</pre></code>

*Example Test steps (Xcode 11 Beta 3 and Xcode 10.3 ):*
<h4>Have two versions of Xcode installed (preferably xcode 11 beta 3 and 10.3 as they are the latest)</h4>
<h4>Make sure xcode 11 beta 3 is selected from the system e.g. <code>sudo xcode-select -switch <path/to/>Xcode.app</code></h4>
<h4>Try to run a simulator linked to Xcode 10.3 (in this instance 12.4 Sims)</h4>

The following message is then shown in the console: 
<code><pre>
[ERROR]  Unable to find any Xcode installations that support both iOS 13.0 and iOS Simulator F9E38F31-01E3-41CF-9E41-88D538471A10.

Build failed. Process exited with code 1.
</pre></code>

   [~smohammed] You think this is still an issue? We did a bunch of cleanup to ioslib v1 since July 2019. I have been using Xcode 10 and 11 side-by-side this whole time and I've seen this error before, I'm pretty sure we fixed it.</li>
