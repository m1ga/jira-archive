<h3>Description</h3>

Add visibility property to View (and any control that inherits from View) to support collapse, in addition to hidden.

Currently, if you want to collapse a view and you set the visible property to false, it will be invisible but still take up real estate on the screen.   Would be great to support a "visibility" property (and probably align it with the CSS property def: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_class_visibility.asp)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_class_visibility.asp)</a> so that a control can be hidden and collapsed.


<code><pre>
<View visibility="hidden" />
<View visibility="collapse" />
<View visibility="visible" />
</pre></code>

   You can set the view's "width" and "height" properties to zero to collapse it.
   
   Most native UI frameworks (particularly Apple's and Microsoft's) don't support a "collapse" like property. Meaning we would have to set the width/height to zero natively anyways to do this. Titanium is tightly bound to native UI and I think we should accept this behavior.
   
   Note that Android supports a "collapse" like feature via <code>View.GONE</code>, but this is the only native UI framework that I know of that does.</li>

   Note that Android also supports this on Titanium already, e.g. hidden vs. gone. It just needs iOS parity</li>
