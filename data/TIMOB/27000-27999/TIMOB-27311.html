<h3>Description</h3>

*Summary*:
In apps targeting Titanium SDK 8.0.1+ custom ListView elements will reset accessibility focus to the top/start of the Window. This behavior is not apparent in version 7.5.2 or 8.0.0

I have attached a sample app demonstrating the bug behavior. If it would help to demonstrate the behavior further I could attach a short video.

*Steps to Reproduce*:
<h4>Unzip attached accessSwipe project</h4>
<h4>Build and run on a physical Android device</h4>
<h4>Navigate to accessibility settings and turn on Android TalkBack/Voice Assistant</h4>
<h4>Keep swiping with 1 finger to the right of the screen to advance element focus</h4>

*Result*:
Labels inside the HeaderView and Buttons in the ListView that have not been focused before will reset focus back to the start of the Window.

*Expected Result*:
The focused and highlighted element should sequentially flow top to bottom of the screen.

   Hello, I tried to test the issue with the accessibility/talk back turned on in my device. I wasn't sure what is the issue here? can you please provide the video demonstration for a clear understanding of the issue? Thank you. </li>

   I attached a screen recording of the behavior. 
   Notice how the focused element will disappear and start again at the top of the page when it is focused for the first time. 
   This makes it difficult for disabled users to utilize accessibility gestures like the swipe right I was doing which moves to the next element on the page.
   
   Thank you for looking into this.</li>

   Hello [~zlitten], Thanks for the video demonstration. Actually, I was able to reproduce the issue before with SDK 8.0.2.GA. I do see the focusing elements keep start again when the I swipe with one finger to the right of the screen. Also, Not sure why it focuses on the window title. Will send this to the engineering for investigation. Thanks.</li>

   Yes it's a strange behavior that I noticed showed up only after 8.0.1
   Thank you for escalating this issue!</li>
