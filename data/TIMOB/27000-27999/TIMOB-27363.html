<h3>Description</h3>

If a new project has a framework that contains .png or .plist files (or remove the generated platform/iOS folder) the first build on device fails to install app.
The incremental build works fine. Also once the platform/ios folder is generated after build runign the full build or incremental build works fine.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a new alloy project. Add any framework containing PNG files into platform/ios under the app folder. (If adding to existing project then remove <project>/platform/ios folder)
2. Build and run the app for device

Actual Result:
The app fails to install with following error:
<code><pre>
[ERROR] An error occurred during build after 6s 579ms
[ERROR] Failed to install app on device (0xe8008001)
[ERROR] For some reason the app failed to install on the device. Try reconnecting your device and check your provisioning profile and entitlements.
</pre></code>

The next build (incremental build) works fine.

Expected Result:
The app should be installed on every build
