<h3>Description</h3>

I recently needed to update my iOS push notification certification. When uploading my exported certification it kept repeatedly stating that the wrong password was being used. Even though I was directly copy-pasting the password that was made from the password generator. Still the same thing after typing the long string in manually, and a couple more times just to be sure it wasn't my own error. I eventually learned that in order for the password field to take my password I had to escape the "$" that was in my password.

So for example, if my password was "pa$sword" in order to input it into the field I had to escape it like so before it would take it: "pa\$sword". I found it a little surprising considering it is a password field. I feel like the form field should be updated or mention having to escape special characters in the [documentation here](<a href="https://docs.axway.com/bundle/Titanium_SDK_allOS_en/page/configuring_push_services.html#Configuringpushservices-ConfiguringpushservicesforiOSdevices)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://docs.axway.com/bundle/Titanium_SDK_allOS_en/page/configuring_push_services.html#Configuringpushservices-ConfiguringpushservicesforiOSdevices)</a> to prevent confusion of other users.

   Hello [~zlitten], Thanks for reporting this issue. Actually, there is no restriction and no known character limitations for adding password on .p12 certificate. We are investigating on this issue and back to you soon with some updates. Thanks</li>

   Hello Rakhi,
   
   I do not understand what is exactly being asked of me, but I am happy to assist in any way!</li>

   If what Fazlul is saying is correct, that there are no character limitations on the field in the Dashboard, then I think that this issue may be a red herring for you guys. The problem may have arose from Apple's tool which creates the password when exporting the certificate to a .p12 file.</li>
