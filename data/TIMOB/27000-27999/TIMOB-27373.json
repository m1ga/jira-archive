		"description": "I recently needed to update my iOS push notification certification. When uploading my exported certification it kept repeatedly stating that the wrong password was being used. Even though I was directly copy-pasting the password that was made from the password generator. Still the same thing after typing the long string in manually, and a couple more times just to be sure it wasn't my own error. I eventually learned that in order for the password field to take my password I had to escape the \"$\" that was in my password.\r\n\r\nSo for example, if my password was \"pa$sword\" in order to input it into the field I had to escape it like so before it would take it: \"pa\\$sword\". I found it a little surprising considering it is a password field. I feel like the form field should be updated or mention having to escape special characters in the [documentation here|https://docs.axway.com/bundle/Titanium_SDK_allOS_en/page/configuring_push_services.html#Configuringpushservices-ConfiguringpushservicesforiOSdevices] to prevent confusion of other users.",
