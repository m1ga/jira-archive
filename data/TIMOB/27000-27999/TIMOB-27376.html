<h3>Description</h3>

The following is printed as red error text when building for iOS:

<code><pre>
&gt;&gt; [ERROR] 2019-08-22 23:51:47.821 xcodebuild[39858:743045] warning:  The file reference for "" is a member of multiple groups ("TableView & ListView" and "UI"); this indicates a malformed project.  Only the membership in one of the groups will be preserved (but membership in targets will be unaffected).  If you want a reference to the same file in more than one group, please add another reference to the same path.

Those are warnings that indicate a malformed Xcode project. Since they will be printed as red warning messages they get especially confusing when the build actually fails.

   Thanks to [~hknoechel] for the PR!
   
   [~amukherjee] this is an important QoL improvement that should make it into 8.2.0 considering that this version is specifically targeted for iOS. I've seen multiple reports on Slack where users have mistaken the warning as the reason of build errors, causing a lot of confusion when tracking down the actual error.</li>
