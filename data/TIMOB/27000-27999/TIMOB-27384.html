<h3>Description</h3>

When accessing the (in iOS 13 deprecated) "statusBarFrame" property, e.g. for rare view controller changes, the app can crash. Migrating to the iOS 13+ "statusBarManager" API of the "UIWindowScene" will fix the issue.

It can be reproduced by trying my [titanium-scanner](<a href="https://github.com/hansemannn/titanium-scanner)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/hansemannn/titanium-scanner)</a> module and clicking "Cancel" on the scanner view controller.

   cc [~amukherjee] [~vijaysingh] This one is important for 8.2.0, so apps don't crash in complex cases.</li>

   Using the example app in Ti.Scanner module as provided by [~hknoechel] there were no issues upon clicking Cancel on the scanner view. Detailed steps as mentioned in the PR <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/11201" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/11201</a>
   However was able to reproduce a crash as mentioned by [~vijaysingh] in the same PR following the steps as below:
   1. Click on 'Scan Document'.
   2. Click on camera button to capture photo.
   3. Click on 'Keep Scan' button, which will open camera again and previously captured photo will be in preview form in bottom left side.
   4. Click the preview image.
   5. Click on 'done' or 'retake' button.</li>
</ol>
