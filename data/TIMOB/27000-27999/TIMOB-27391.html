<h3>Description</h3>

I created a project trying to use the Braintree library.

This is my Podfile:
<code><pre>
install! 'cocoapods',
         :integrate_targets =&gt; false

platform :ios, '9.0'
target 'BraintreeAlloy' do
	pod 'Braintree'
	pod 'BraintreeDropIn'
	pod 'Braintree/PayPal'
end
</pre></code>

This is where it fails, the log level is already trace:

<code><pre>
[WARN]  [Hyperloop] CocoaPods ** BUILD FAILED **
[WARN]  [Hyperloop] CocoaPods The following build commands failed:
[WARN]  [Hyperloop] CocoaPods 	CompileC /BraintreeAlloy/build/iphone/build/Products/Pods.build/Debug-iphonesimulator/BraintreeDropIn.build/Objects-normal/x86_64/BTUIPaymentMethodCollectionViewCell.o /BraintreeAlloy/Pods/BraintreeDropIn/BraintreeDropIn/Custom\ Views/BTUIPaymentMethodCollectionViewCell.m normal x86_64 objective-c com.apple.compilers.llvm.clang.1_0.compiler
[WARN]  [Hyperloop] CocoaPods (1 failure)
[ERROR] An error occurred during build after 18s 504ms
[ERROR] the xcodebuild failed running from /BraintreeAlloy/Pods
</pre></code>

it doesn't give any indication of what could be wrong. Any way of going deeper on the issue?

   Hello,
   Thanks for reaching out with us. Can you please try to use the SDK 8.0.0.GA, let try to build again and let us know how it goes.</li>
<li>Alberto Marcone 2019-04-10

   sorry, that was just a warning.
   
   For some reason the file Pods-BraintreeAlloy-resources.sh is not created.</li>
<li>Alberto Marcone 2019-04-10

   ok, after creating the file manually, it worked. Is this a bug?</li>
<li>Rakhi Mitro 2019-04-10

   [~a.marcone],
   We are discussing with our teammates about this. You will be notified.</li>

   This is an issue with the Braintree library. See <a href="https://github.com/braintree/braintree_ios/issues/453." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/braintree/braintree_ios/issues/453.</a> This prevents the CocoaPods build from completing successfully which then results in missing files.</li>

   Hello [~a.marcone], What's the status of your issue? Can you get back here with that you need? Thanks.</li>
<li>Rakhi Mitro 2019-05-14

   [~a.marcone],
   We haven't heard back from you since our last response. Let us know the current status of your issue whether the provided workaround was helpful or not.Â </li>

   Re-opening this after double checking because of another issue. The CocoaPods build works fine in a native project, so it should work with Hyperloop too.
   
   This happens because we pass the project configured iOS deployment target to the CocoaPods build, which overrides pod's specific project settings. The CocoaPods build should stick to the settings specified in each individual pod and users are responsible to make sure that pods are compatible with the minimum iOS deployment target set in their project.</li>
