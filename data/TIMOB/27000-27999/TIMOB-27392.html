<h3>Description</h3>

PencilKit makes it easy to incorporate hand-drawn content into your iOS or macOS apps quickly and easily. PencilKit provides a drawing environment for your iOS app that takes input from Apple Pencil, or the user's finger, and turns it into high quality images you display in either iOS or macOS. The environment comes with tools for creating, erasing, and selecting lines.

You capture content in your iOS app using a PKCanvasView object. The canvas object is a view that you integrate into your existing view hierarchy. It supports the low-latency capture of touches originating from Apple Pencil or your finger. It then vends the final results as a PKDrawingReference object, whose contents you can save with your app’s content. You can also convert the drawn content into an image, which you can display in your iOS or macOS app.

This would be really useful for creative and productivity focussed apps being made in Titanium.

   I agree this should be done, but definitely not in the SDK. It could be a community driven open source module, ideally written in Swift.</li>

   Thanks [~hknoechel]. Just for my understanding, can I ask why this should not be in the main SDK? Just curious about what the basis for the differentiation is.</li>
<li>Hans Knöchel 2019-06-16

   The main reason is that there is no Android equivalent and the use-case is very specific. Also, the API is quite independent from other API's, so no existing API's need to be reused to implement that. Finally, the core should stay slim to improve compile time and app size. If I can help with the module, let me know.</li>

   Thanks for the explanation. Makes sense. If you are able to help that would be fantastic. I am not personally familiar with writing modules. It is an incredibly powerful toolset that would be so useful inside Ti. I predict users will be looking for / expecting Pencil support on iPad apps.</li>

   Hello [~mdelmarter], Did you get around creating the module? Let us know your progress. You can reach out to Hans for help. Thanks.</li>

   Hi [~sdarda] no I haven't. I was more creating this ticket so that PencilKit didn't get forgotten in the list of items to work on for iOS 13. I would like to use PencilKit if possible, but it is not a high priority for me right now compared to other things I am working on.</li>
