<h3>Description</h3>

If you are using SDK 8.2.0.RC and you try to target an iOS 12.x simulator from Xcode 10.x, it will find the simulator but then error out by saying it is not available.

   I believe it's important for this to be possible. Existing developers will want to be able to do 4 things:
   
   1. Develop new apps in 8.2.x for iOS 13 and test and run on iOS 13 sims and devices
   2. Support existing apps on <8.2.x with iOS 12 and test and run on iOS 12 sims and devices (and on iOS13 devices over the air / via cable etc)
   3. Support existing apps on <8.2.x with iOS 13 and test and run on iOS 13 sims to debug issues
   4. Develop new apps in 8.2.x for iOS 13 and test and run on iOS 11 + 12 sims (for debugging issues)
   
   These 3 would be key for me to support clients with existing apps that aren't ready to be updated yet to iOS 13.
   
   We can do 1, 2 and 3 with the RC release and running Xcode 10 and 11 side by side.
   
   Currently we *can't do no. 4.*
   
   If we can support this then it's possible for devs to run 2 Xcode's side by side, support existing apps, build new ones and test new ones on older sims which is a win-win.</li>

   I think our discussions on teams we figured that this was the same as TIMOB-27338. Any objections to me closing as a duplicate?</li>

   Technically, this is not a dupe of TIMOB-27338, but it's close enough. I've create a PR and assigned it to TIMOB-27338. <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/ioslib/pull/98" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/ioslib/pull/98</a></li>
