<h3>Description</h3>

Our test suite suddenly had a mysterious error. The root cause is that a stringified test failure result was longer than an inherent Android log limit. Internal android_log_write caps the messages at 4076 bytes. We do nothing to guard against this or deal with it, so if users call Ti.API.info() with a very long message it will get truncated.

Android itself has a hack in place on the Java side to split messages naturally by any newlines inside of them and log each chunk.

We could do the same via a JS shim in our common JS code internal to the SDK for Android. (Since the implementation of APIModule is in C++ and would be more difficult to hack this in).
