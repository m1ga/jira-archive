Node.js 8.9.4

  npm Version                 = 5.6.0

  CLI Version                 = 5.2.1

  SDK Version                 = 8.1.1.GA
Device: iPhone SE(12.3.1), Simulator:iPhone 7 Plus
</pre></code>

*Test steps:*

1.Download the module from [here](<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1exZfnH_rfl4O0eo4Q4RGq63my-tD_A3V/view)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1exZfnH_rfl4O0eo4Q4RGq63my-tD_A3V/view)</a>
