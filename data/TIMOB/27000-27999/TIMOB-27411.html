<h3>Description</h3>

Would be great to be able to have access to the iOS and Android properties that are defined in the tiapp.xml file.   For some things like "team-id", a developer needs to define it again as either at different tiapp.xml property, config.json, or somewhere else in order to be able to use it when doing things like Keychain access.

   I'm not following. The Titanium build as well as Titanium CLI plugins have access to <code>builder.tiapp.ios\['team-id'\]</code>. There are no properties that are used that aren't explicitly defined.
   
   Are you talking about Alloy and it's old tiapp.xml parser?
   
   Can you describe in more detail your use case?</li>

   I was talking about from within the app code itself.  Right now, in order to use the team-id, we need to store it in both properties and team-id elements in tiapp.xml.</li>

   Oh, ok, then I have that use case covered. All of those properties like team-id and use-app-thinning should never have been their own tag, rather properties. I would have guessed that team-id would be only of interested during build. Interesting.</li>

   Thanks!  We have to have access to the team-id for stuff like keychain access</li>
