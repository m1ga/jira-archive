<h3>Description</h3>

On iOS, if you have images that end in "-dark", they are no longer working after updating to 8.2.x SDK.  The SDK now believes that these are images for use with iOS Dark Mode.

   Thats native iOS behavior. Users should rename their images or the CLI should detect files with "-dark" that don't have a base (light) file and throw an error on build time.</li>

   Is this really the case for native iOS objective-c or swift development?  Any images that end in "-dark" are automatically assumed to have been created for a "dark" mode?  I thought this was a Titanium implementation that then assigned it iOS dark/light mode images.</li>

   It seems that if you specify an image that ends in "-dark", such as "myimage-dark.png" it would look for "myimage-dark-dark.png"  and "myimage-dark-light.png".   </li>
