<h3>Description</h3>

We are seeing an uncaught exception handler warning in TitaniumKit that has been caught by Crashlytics:
<code><pre>
[DEBUG] [Crashlytics:Crash] Warning: NSUncaughtExceptionHandler is 'TiUncaughtExceptionHandler' in '/Users/user/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Devices/xx/data/Containers/Bundle/Application/yy/MyApp.app/Frameworks/TitaniumKit.framework/TitaniumKit'
</pre></code>
This has only been uncovered because of the logging improvements of TIMOB-27331 and may exists for a long time. The reason for it is that the <code>TiUncaughtExceptionHandler</code> overrides the parent exception handler incorrectly, causing other exception handlers to report crashes incorrectly.

   Since I cannot edit my tickets anymore, here some additional notes after some investigation:
   * I think it's Xcode 11 only (so highly relevant for 8.2.1)
   * It occurs since a while but wasn't uncovered so far because the "old" logging system did not stream all native logs to the console.
   * To reproduce, simply run a sample app with an SDK that has the changes from TIMOB-27331 (again, that one isn't causing the issues but makes it possible to uncover them)</li>
