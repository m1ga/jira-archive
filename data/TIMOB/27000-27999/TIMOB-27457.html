<h3>Description</h3>

We would like to request a clarification on how the 7.5.0+ bootstrap concept (ti.main.js but also Node polyfills like fs) influence the boot time and build size. We feel like recent changes to support more Node.js modules was done for the cost of size and boot performance. A developer should be able to opt in or at least opt out to these changes to keep apps slim.

What'd be especially interesting are the benchmarking of booting in < 7.5.0, 7.5.0 and 8.3.0 as well as the resulting build size in production. Performance in cross platform frameworks is a big decision point these days, so I hope this can be taken seriously. Thank you!

   Hi there! Any update on this? It'd be good to see how the bootstrap files influence the boot time, although it's really fast and we could not complain atm.</li>
