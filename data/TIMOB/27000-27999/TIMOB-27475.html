<h3>Description</h3>

After running following code:
<code><pre>Ti.Geolocation.requestLocationPermissions(Ti.Geolocation.AUTHORIZATION_WHEN_IN_USE,function(e){
Ti.API.info("RESPONSE = "+ JSON.stringify(e));
}); 
</pre></code>
I am getting following response:
<code><pre>
[INFO] RESPONSE = {"code":1,"error":"The requested permissions do not match the selected permission (the user likely declined AUTHORIZATION_ALWAYS permissions) in iOS 11+","success":false,"authorizationStatus":3}
</pre></code>
After checking which permission was granted it appears that Ti.Geolocation.AUTHORIZATION_ALWAYS was granted instead of Ti.Geolocation.AUTHORIZATION_WHEN_IN_USE. This needs to be fixed.

*Test environment*: SDK- 8.2.0.GA
Appcelerator Command-Line Interface, version 7.1.1
Reproducible device: iPhone SE and iPhone 5C on IOS 10.3.3

I have tested on following device but cannot reproduce it:
iPhone 6+ (iOS 12.4.2) and iPod 5S(9.3.3)

*Note*: We have no iPhone SE and iPhone 5C devices available, so we failed to check this on those devices.

   Unable to reproduce this bug.  Also observed another issue in regard to the permission failing to pop up when app is reinstalled (without uninstalling app first) and launched on 3 of the devices i.e. iOS versions 12.4, 11.0.3 and 11.4 but popped up as expected for iOS 13.0 device. See attached console message after failing to pop up. !Screenshot 2019-10-29 at 16.41.57.png|thumbnail!

   [~ahutton] When I delete it and install a new one the permission shows as expected. It only doesn't show when app is already installed on device and reinstalled without deletion. I observed this issue on 3 of the devices with iOS versions: 12.4, 11.0.3 and 11.4 but not on 13.0</li>

   [~ahutton] Okay. I get it.</li>
