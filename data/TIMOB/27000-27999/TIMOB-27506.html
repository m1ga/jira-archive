<h3>Description</h3>

Not quite sure if this is actually a bug, so instead I filed it as an improvement. I raised the issue in TiSlack and it was suggested I create a ticket for this.

We recently had our apps audited for accessibility compliancy and one of the major issues communicated to us is that the Navigation Icon in the DrawerLayout has an accessibility label of "Open" which is not descriptive enough for users. 

I haven't been able to set this property using the DrawerLayout's accessibilityLabel. The DrawerLayout's property seems to correspond to the whole container which fills the screen.

I have attached a sample app.

To test, turn on TalkBack/Voice Assistant in device's accessibility settings. Open the app and click on the DrawerLayout's menu navigation icon.

   Hello [~zlitten], I have tried to test the issue on our end with the sample code provided above, Can you please share a video demonstration of the issue behavior that you observe? It will be helpful to understand the issue more clearly. Thanks.</li>

   Hello Sharif,
   A video is not really going to help much here since the screen recorder can't capture device audio. I will however attach screenshots if that helps.
   
   
   Please note that in this build with the screenshots I updated the Titanium SDK to 8.1.0.GA.
   
   The navigation icon focused here has an accessibilityLabel of "Open"
   !Screenshot_1.jpg|thumbnail!  
   
   The navigation icon focused here (after opening drawer) has an accessibilityLabel of "Close"
   !Screenshot_2.jpg|thumbnail!  
   
   This screenshot just shows the focused area of the whole DrawerLayout element, with my own applied accessibilityLabel of "Nav Menu"
   !Screenshot_3.jpg|thumbnail! 
   
   Our accessibility partners argue that the navigation icon button's accessibility label text is not descriptive enough to let users know what the control does. As far as I know, there's not a way to currently set the accessibility properties on that navigation icon element of the app bar with the DrawerLayout.
   
   Thank you for your attention on this.</li>
