This one happened before my splash screen even showed, so to me that looked like it was erroring before any of my HTTP calls were being made.  I was hoping that the warning I provided might be able to shed a clue as to where the error was originating within ti.main.js\r\n\r\nMy api team assured me that all our apis were operable at the time, and unfortunately the logs from the incident are long gone.  Best I can do is keep watch moving forward.  \r\n\r\nThanks\r\nEric",
