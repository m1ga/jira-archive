<code><pre>

Tested in SDK 8.2.1.GA in iPad simulator. There is no issue in SDK 8.2.0.GA. Thanks.

   This is a critical issue for us and broke large portions of our app. Appcelerator support told us we had to update to 8.2.1 to support updates in the ACA module. Please advise!</li>
<li>Jan Vennemann 2019-11-11

   This issue was already fixed in TIMOB-27503 and will be included in 8.3.0. The RC release will be this week with the GA release following shortly after. You can already use by installing from the 8_3_X branch directly with <code>ti sdk install -b 8_3_X</code>.</li>

   Thanks Jan. Is there a list of known bugs with 8_3_X? Every time we update an SDK right now 10 other things break. We haven't been able to release an update to our app in months without bugs due to the SDK or ACA. The solution is constantly to update the SDK to move forward.</li>

   [~homeinspectorpro], if there are known issues for a release they will be stated in the release notes. Obviously we can't know all issues in advance. Even with unit tests, E2E tests and regression testing from our QE team, unfortunately things can slip through. That's why we also encourage users to try out RC releases if they can, allowing us to collect valuable feedback from real world usage and finding possible unknown issues before GA.
   
   I'm sorry to hear that you are having troubles with recent updates. We are continuously adding tests to the mentioned unit test suite as well as E2E tests via Appium to catch issues like this in the feature.
   
   If you have more details about what blocked you from doing successful updates in the past, please feel free to drop me a line at jvennemann@axway.com. This can also help us improve feature releases.</li>
