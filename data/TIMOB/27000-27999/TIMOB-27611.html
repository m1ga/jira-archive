   [~smohammed], I suspect the fix [~gmathews] made for [TIMOB-27610] will solve this issue too since the "bootstrap.json" file is encrypted with the JS files. [~gmathews]'s PRs have already been merged into "master" and 8.3.0. Would you mind giving it another go please? Thanks.</li>

   [~jquick] I ran this a few times and I was not able to see the error message mentioned in the description. </li>

   Closing. Fixed in 8.3.0.GA.</li>
