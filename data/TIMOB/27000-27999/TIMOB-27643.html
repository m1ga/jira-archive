<h3>Description</h3>

*Customer issue:* In our application (Android only), when we send the application to the background, and then went back to the app, on the resume, we do a time validation and when needed, we present the fingerprint dialog.

The problem is that the user is able to see that data, even when we remove almost all validations on the resume event, and send the fingerprint dialog to show.

We already tried setting the flagSecure property to all windows in our app, and we are still seeing the same behavior.

I attach a video with the current behavior, we need the app to not show anything when coming from the background.

Thank you.

   The <code>flagSecure</code> property is a creation-only flag. So it can only be set when creating the window.
   
   <code><pre>
   const win = Ti.UI.createWindow({
       flagSecure: true
       ...
   });
   </pre></code>
   
   When this is set to <code>true</code>, I can no longer see the preview of my application when viewing recent applications or during its resume.
   
   The issue is that they are seeing a window with sensitive information just before the authentication window appears after resuming the application. Which they should not be seeing when this flag is set.</li>
