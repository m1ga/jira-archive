<h3>Description</h3>

Currently, there are no independent functions to check or request permissions to add a photo to the user's photo gallery.   If you want to do this now, you have to call requestPhotoGalleryPermissions which is tied to this key:  NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription

There are two distinct permissions that Apple has:

NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription
NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription

The first one is for accessing photos in the photo gallery and the second one is for adding photos to the photo gallery.   It is possible that you want to read, but not write to the photo gallery.   The current available calls seem to request both.

We need a set of functions similar to this:

hasPhotoGalleryAddPermissions()
requestPhotoGalleryAddPermissions()
