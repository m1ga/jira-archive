If you want to do this now, you have to call requestPhotoGalleryPermissions which is tied to this key:  NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription\r\n\r\nThere are two distinct permissions that Apple has:\r\n\r\nNSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription\r\nNSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription\r\n\r\nThe first one is for accessing photos in the photo gallery and the second one is for adding photos to the photo gallery.   It is possible that you want to read, but not write to the photo gallery.   The current available calls seem to request both.\r\n\r\nWe need a set of functions similar to this:\r\n\r\nhasPhotoGalleryAddPermissions()\r\nrequestPhotoGalleryAddPermissions()\r\n\r\n\r\n",
