<h3>Description</h3>

Our APIdocs frequently re-use similar arguments to methods but are not consistent in referring to those object shapes as defined types. Additionally, there may be duplicated types, types that haven't been defined but should be, or types that are defined but methods/properties don't refer to them and instead use generic Object/Dictionary type.

This is relevant to have properly define docs, but also in that we have started to ship typescript definitions generated from he docs and can rely on these more formal definitions in editors/IDE for more reliable content assist.
