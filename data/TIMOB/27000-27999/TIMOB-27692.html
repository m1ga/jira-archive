<h3>Description</h3>

Client has a webview component where they are running a page with some jQuery and javascript, they have noticed a discrepancy with iOS and android in that the unload function does not work for iOS webview.
<code><pre>
$(window).unload(function () {
chat.server.send('[SYSTEM]', $('#displayname').val() + ' has left', $('#operatorid').val(), $('#convoID').val());
});
</pre></code>

This is the specific jQuery line they're using.
They basically have a webview where the URL points to a page that's using javascript and jquery
and they want code to run in the .unload function.

it's not running for iOS webview but work for android.

   [~rislam] could they provide a full sample showing their issue, the jquery snippet provided is not enough for us to debug this issue. Ideally we would like a full classic sample for this issue as it requires setting up the project with jquery etc
   
   At a glance though, I don't think this will be a titanium issue, we don't own the webview or jquery. I did a quick search for "jquery unload safari not working" and there's a lot of stackoverflow posts about this being unreliable cross platform.</li>
