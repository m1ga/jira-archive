<h3>Description</h3>

Since we no longer will be supporting Windows universal as app targets, we should remove the download/inclusion of windows in the SDK builds.

   This was merged as there are no specific FR steps. In general, we need to confirm:
   - The win32 builds of our SDK no longer include "windows" as a platform
   - Android on Windows still works ok (i.e. we didn't somehow break something in the toolchain/build process)
   
   I think that should get discovered by android on Windows smoke testing/usage pretty easily.</li>
