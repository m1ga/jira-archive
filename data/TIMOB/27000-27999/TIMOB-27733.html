<h3>Description</h3>

Currently, when you do a Titanium build, it generates all the necessary missing image sizes based on the original images.  However, this task has to be completed each and every time you do a build.

It would make sense to do this one time, and possibly generate the images into the /app directory instead so that the next time a build is done, it would see that these images already exist and skip this part of the build.

   +1, this is really a long term issue. Pre-generate and cache.</li>
