<h3>Description</h3>

Hi, 
I have upgraded the titanium SDK 7.2.0.GA to 8.3.1.GA, but after upgrading Windows app having the following issues:
 1) Small Fonts Size 
 2) Splash Screen 
 3) Random Crashes

1) Small Font Size issues got resolved in 8.3.1.GA but got another issue with UI alignment.
All UI alignment is changed and it's not proper
2) Got workaround 
3) Not able to fixed

The third point is resolved in 9.0.0.v20181031080737. And as per the earlier discussion the 9.0.0.GA is going to release in the end of Jan 2020.

Please provide the estimated date of release 9.0.0.GA.

   [~shishir.roy] Can you attach a test case to reproduce this issue where shows the following two issues with Ti SDK 8.3.1.GA? Also, attach some screenshots and crash log 
   
   1. UI alignment is changed and it's not proper
   2. Random Crashes
   
   Thanks!</li>
<li>shishir.roy 2020-02-05

   
   So it is difficult to provide test app, but the same thing is working fine in SDK version 9.0.0.v20181031080737 in the Windows app. I suggest please check the difference in
   Latest SDK with SDK version 9.0.0.v20181031080737. So that you can identify something out of it.
   
   If you want some online session, then I can show you the issues which we are facing.
   We are working in India time zone. So if possible please arrange some online session for quick solution.
   
   I have attached 2 videos for SDK version-8.3.1.GA and SDK Version - 7.2.0.GA app with executing the same scenario 
   
   Check Case# 01132407 / In Support / Issues with upgrading titanium SDK in Windows App
   </li>
<li>Shuo Liang 2020-02-06

   Also, they want to know the ETA of 9.0.0 release. </li>
<li>shishir.roy 2020-02-21

   I got an update from your team saying that Windows issues which are mention below conversation will be fixing in Titanium SDK  8.3.2, So please provide the release date for the SDK. 
   
   This is already an impediment for your release and the customer is waiting to release our Windows app.
   
   So please take this as a priority and let us know the release date with fixes.
   
   Please check the below case 
   <a href="https://support.axway.com/en/case-center/view/id/01132407" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://support.axway.com/en/case-center/view/id/01132407</a></li>
<li>Abir Mukherjee 2020-02-21

   [~shishir.roy] I just assigned it the engineering team. We'll be looking to get the fix in SDK 8.3.x. I'll get back to you next week on the timing when I have a better idea on the effort required.</li>
<li>Abir Mukherjee 2020-02-24

   [~shishir.roy] can you please provide sample code that can produces the screen shares/videos? </li>
<li>shishir.roy 2020-02-25

   I have already mentioned earlier it was a random crash and it is very difficult to provide sample code. 
   Please check the support axway link for more detail.</li>
<li>Ewan Harris 2020-02-25

   [~shishir.roy], can you please clarify the issues you are having. As I understand it the following issues are still active:
   
   1. Splash screen issue
   * We are unsure what this issue is, but you have worked around it.
   
   2. UI alignment issue
   * We can see that there is a different in the UI from 7.2.0.GA to 8.3.1.GA from your video. However that isn't something that we can action upon, we need a clear reproducible code sample that demonstrates the issue in order for us to debug (this is the code that Abir was asking for)
   
   3. Random crashes
   * Again, not much we can investigate here without some form of a crash log, I believe crash logs from development apps can be found in <code>C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\WER\ReportArchive\</code>
   
   The following issue was fixed in 8.3.1.GA
   
   1. Font sizing issue
   * This was fixed in TIMOB-27638/TIMOB-27640
   
   Also just to note, the build that you refer to where these issues are fixed (9.0.0.v20181031080737) is from October 2018, before development work began on the 9.0.0 release. The Windows platform in this build is functionally the same as the 7.2.0.GA release.</li>
<li>shishir.roy 2020-02-25

   </li>
<li>Ewan Harris 2020-02-25

    [~shishir.roy], I understand that it's hard to provide, but there's not much we can do to investigate that UI issue without some code that reproduces it.
    
    As my previous comment states <code>9.0.0.v20181031080737</code> is functionally equivalent to 7.2.0.GA (i.e the contents are the same). The issue working there does not mean that we can backport it to the 8.3.0 line as it is more than likely a consequence of something merged between the 7.2.0.GA release and the 9.0.0 release.</li>
<li>shishir.roy 2020-02-25

    In that case, log file will help you to figure out the issue. I can try to get the log which you mention in below 
    C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\WER\ReportArchive
    
    </li>
<li>Ewan Harris 2020-02-25

    [~shishir.roy] the log file will help for item 3 (random crashes), it will not help for item 2 (UI alignment).</li>
<li>shishir.roy 2020-02-25

    I have sent you log file via email. Let me know if you received or not </li>
<li>Ewan Harris 2020-02-26

    [~shishir.roy], I have not received an email from yourself. Are you able to provide anything for us to try and investigate issue 2 (UI alignment)?</li>
<li>shishir.roy 2020-02-26

    How I will attach the log in Jira. I don't see any way to attach file.
    
    For issue 2, I am trying to create a sample code, once done I will share with you  </li>
<li>Ewan Harris 2020-02-26

    [~shishir.roy] under the "More" button there is an "Attach Files". That should allow you to upload them.
    
    I just want to set some expectations too, the crash log _may_ help us diagnose the issues causing the crash, but there's no guarantees that we'll be able to pinpoint the exact reason. Also, for the UI issues, it's possible that this may be caused by the change we made in 8.0.0 with TIMOB-25582 (as Kota had described previously), this change means that in SDK versions lower than 8 we would use <code>px</code> as the default unit on Windows, with that ticket we aligned with iOS and Android and respected the tiapp setting, which in theory will cause layout differences in the UI. Have you tried changing the ti.ui.defaultunit property in your tiapp to <code>px</code> to see if this restores the UI to match 7.2.0.GA behaviour?</li>
<li>shishir.roy 2020-02-26

    I don't see any option for attachment in more button:
    Option available for me:
     - create Zephyr test
     - Stop watching 
     - Remote copy
    
    </li>
<li>Ewan Harris 2020-02-26

    Hmm that's weird, could you try and upload it via the support portal? I'm able to access files from there</li>
<li>shishir.roy 2020-02-26

    I have attached log in the support portal:
    
    <a href="https://support.axway.com/en/case-center/view/id/01132407" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://support.axway.com/en/case-center/view/id/01132407</a></li>

<li>Ewan Harris 2020-03-04

    [~shishir.roy] have you had any luck producing a sample? Have you also tried changing the <code>ti.ui.defaultunit</code> value in the tiapp to <code>px</code> to see if this behaviour change is caused by TIMOB-25582?
    
    I've had a quick look at the crash logs and I think we might need to try and gather some more information, unfortunately I'm travelling this week so I can't gather the details of what we'll need myself. I'll try to get back to you with more infromation asap</li>
<li>shishir.roy 2020-03-04

    I have tried with changing the value of ti.ui.defaultunit to "px" and it was working but some UI correction required to fix.
    
    As of now please provide the information on the Crash issue.
    </li>

    [~shishir.roy] In order to obtain better debug information you can run the application using Visual Studio:
    
    1. Build your project.
    2. Navigate to the VS build project folder located <code>C:\Users\&lt;Username&gt;\.titanium\&lt;Project&gt;</code>
    3. Open the <code>win.x86</code> folder or <code>win.x64</code> folder (dependent on target architecture).
     !build.jpg|thumbnail!
    4. Open the Visual Studio project solution.
     !solution.jpg|thumbnail!
    5. Right-click the project in the Solution panel and <code>Set as default project</code>
     !project.jpg|thumbnail! 
    6. Run the application.
     !run.jpg|thumbnail!
    7. You may need to ignore and skip this exception (may occur multiple times during launch) by clicking <code>Continue</code>
     !error.jpg|thumbnail! 
    8. After continuing through the exceptions, your application should be running. Attempt to reproduce the issue and when the application crashes you should be provided with crash details which you can provide to us.</li>

    [~shishir.roy] This provides a little more info, seems there's a threading issue:
    <code><pre>
    Microsoft C++ exception: Platform::WrongThreadException
    </pre></code>
    
    Do you know what Titanium methods your application is calling when the crash occurs (i.e: Titanium.Netowork.*)? I'm also curious if this issue occurs for you on 8.1.0.GA or 8.2.0.GA, it looks to be a regression introduced since 8.0.0.GA and knowing which SDK version it does/doesn't occur on would help track it down.</li>
<li>shishir.roy 2020-03-12

    Yes, it is calling Ti.Network.createHTTPClient inside for loop. And I have tested with few versions (8.0.1.GA, 8.2.0.GA, 8.2.1.GA, 8.3.0.GA, and 8.3.1.GA) and found all have crash issues. The crash is not happening with 7.2.0.GA.</li>
<li>Gary Mathews 2020-03-18

    8_3_X: <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile_windows/pull/1447" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile_windows/pull/1447</a></li>
<li>Gary Mathews 2020-03-18

    [~shishir.roy] You can test these changes by downloading the latest 8_3_X branch build:
    
    <a href="http://builds.appcelerator.com/#8_3_X" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://builds.appcelerator.com/#8_3_X</a>
    
    or
    
    <code><pre>
    appc ti sdk install -b 8_3_X
    </pre></code>
    </li>
<li>shishir.roy 2020-03-19

    I have tested this SDK and found the only one-time crashed. Seems like this is working for us. 
    Can you please the release date of this GA version? So that our QA can verify with this SDK.
    
      </li>

    Any update on the previous query?</li>
