					"body": "Adding some logging, in this case \"adb host:track-devices\" typically gets called twice. Once with \"undefined\" (aka no devices running), and then again when he emulator process starts (with a value like \"emulator5554 offline\"). But in the second case, the emulator boots pretty much *immediately* due to snapshots - so while adb is reporting the emulator is alive but \"offline\" it's actually booted almost instantaneously - but \"adb host:track-devices\" won't fire again. So we'll see the initial offline state and wait around for another event that never happens.\r\n\r\nIt looks like we can't rely on \"adb host:track-devices\" to be the only trigger for re-checking emulator state.",

I've looked at the current code as well as the proposed PR and I can't find anything wrong with the current code other than {{isRunning()}} could possibly be renamed to {{isReady()}}.\r\n\r\nIf a device is \"offline\", then it might as well be shutdown. I don't believe we can connect via ADB to a device that is \"offline\", thus given the context, we need {{isRunning()}} to return {{true}} if and only if the device is online and ready.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, you can't even get Android Emulator 27.0.2. The latest as of today is 29.3.4. There's no way to downgrade. I find it hard to believe that code that hasn't been touched in over a year does NOT work with 27.0.2, but works with 29.3.4.\r\n\r\nI'm curious about how/why {{trackDevices()}} would only emit an \"offline\" event without a subsequent \"device\" event? In my testing, I could always get the \"device\" event. Are you seeing a race condition? Can you reproduce by manually invoking node-titanium-sdk?\r\n\r\nSo, until I see some more reason/proof, I do NOT think we should merge the PR.",
