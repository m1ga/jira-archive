					"body": "[~hknoechel], I can't reproduce this issue with your app.\r\n\r\nI tried running it and quitting it (by swiping it off recents list) and starting it again about 10 times on a physical Android 10.0 and Android 6.0 devices. I also tried enabling the \"Don't keep activities\" option under the Android OS' \"Developer Options\" (causes OS to destroy and recreate activities in back-stack) and it restarted just fine.\r\n\r\nThe error message suggests that the code is attempting to create an object while the V8 runtime isn't running. That's why it prints \"undefined:0\" where it should be printing \"jsFileName:lineNumber\".\r\n\r\nIf you're willing, try this.  Go to the below source file. The code within the if-condition is where the error message is happening.\r\n[./android/runtime/v8/src/native/ProxyFactory.cpp#L82-L86|https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/blob/7aad8f10fe4b46e6eed32c057af1dbf8f2c99624/android/runtime/v8/src/native/ProxyFactory.cpp#L82-L86]\r\n\r\nLet's purposely make it crash by adding the below \"badPointer\" line of code below. This will cause the app to segfault and dump a trace in the C/C++ library. This might help us isolate the cause of this issue.\r\n{code:cpp}\r\nLocal<Object> v8Proxy;\r\nMaybeLocal<Object> maybeV8Proxy = creator->NewInstance(context, 1, argv);\r\nif (!maybeV8Proxy.ToLocal(&v8Proxy)) {\r\n\tLOGE(TAG, \"Exception thrown while creating V8 proxy.\");\r\n\tV8Util::reportException(isolate, tryCatch);\r\n\tint* badPointer = nullptr; *badPointer = 1;  // <- Add this line.\r\n\treturn Local<Object>();\r\n}\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nWe don't currently support debugging the C/C++ side of the SDK even on our end... yet. It's something I want to look into in the future. So, we'll have to do this the hard way at the moment.\r\n",
