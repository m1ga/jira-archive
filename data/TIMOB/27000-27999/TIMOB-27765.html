<h3>Description</h3>

This would be a breaking change to the Titanium CLI but would allow a broader range of features and support a much faster startup time (in some scenarios)

*<code>build</code>* - This command would do exactly what it says: build the app. (no running involved)
*<code>run</code>* - This command would build the app (if necessary) and then run it on device or simulator
*<code>start</code>* - This command would simply start the app (on device or simulator) (no rebuilding)

The first two would clear up some confusion as to function of command and the last command would add the much needed ability to start an app (without rebuilding).   The start command would be especially helpful when reconnecting LiveView after an unexpected disconnect.  Currently, a developer would have to rebuild the entire app and restart LiveView in order to continue using LiveView with the app.

   This is great, but won't make it into Titanium CLI v5 or v6. This would be perfect for v7!
   
   We already have momentum for sunsetting the Appc CLI, so we will have a "ti build" and a "ti run", but "ti build" is just "ti build --build-only". In v6, we should not advertise the <code>\-\-build-only</code> flag and try to get people to use the different commands.
   
   I don't think "ti start" will make it for Titanium CLI v6, but certainly for v7.
   
   I also don't see how "revamping Titanium CLI commands" will improve build speeds. This ticket should be about clarifying "build" vs "run". The "start" command is a new feature, thus new ticket.</li>

   It would be faster because it would not require a rebuild to just start the app.
   
   So on future versions of Titanium CLI, the "run" command will build and the "build" command will run??   I think those need to be swapped (unless it was a typo).</li>

   Sorry, fixed the typo. "ti.build" will do a "ti build --build-only".</li>
