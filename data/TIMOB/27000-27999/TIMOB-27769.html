<h3>Description</h3>

In Tableview when they clicks on any text fields are not pop-up up keyboards but it is focusing (showing cursor) on the textfields.

In their case, the issue is sometimes the keyboard is not opening for the text fields 'Middle name' and 'Last Name' and also once they enter value in 'Middle Name' fields clicks on next button should go to 'Last name' field. But the issue is, It's focusing on 'Last name' field but the text typing in the 'Middle name' field.

Sometimes when they click on text field it is focusing, but it's not opening keyboard

They have tested it with Ti-SDK 8.3.1.GA and above.

   Hi,
   
   I am not sure if it is related to this ticket but there is another issue with text fields and keyboard. If a text field is in focus and the window is closed (like on click of custom back button, not the device's), the keyboard doesn't hide and is visible on the previous screen that the user navigates to because of window close event. This is happening in 8.2.1.GA. I'll really appreciate if that can also be fixed along with this ticket.
   
   Thanks</li>
