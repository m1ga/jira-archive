		"description": "We've automated our \"legacy\" process for publishing docs, which consist of two major doc types:\r\n- API Docs\r\n- Guides\r\n\r\nGuides currently come from our Wiki and are published to docs.appcelerator.com (after being exported as HTML and massaged), and we also trigger a wiki crawl from Zoomin to publish the contents to Zoomin/docs.axway.com\r\n\r\nAPIDocs live as xml files in our titanium_mobile repo, and we use custom node scripts to generate jsduck JS files, then run that through a fork of jsduck to generate the docs.appcelerator.com website.\r\n\r\nMoving forward we'd like to move away from the wiki as source of our Guides content towards markdown files living in a Github repo (probably directly in titanium_mobile?). How can we extract the current wiki contents into markdown? Clean it up? Remove outdated docs? And then how does that get published out to Zoomin?\r\n\r\nWe'd also like to take our API docs and combine efforts with the Dublin team that already published their API docs out. We need to find a way to incorporate multiple products in the same doc website, while hopefully leveraging [~jvennemann]'s work on his prototype: https://appcelerator.github.io/titanium-docs/api/",

Or maybe we just stick a pointer in our repo to the open-docs repo location where they live?\r\n\r\n* Most of the actual API docs I can find seem to live under https://docs.axway.com/category/api and are all server-side APIs.\r\n** Most of them use a Swagger UI to show the APIs (see http://apidocs.axway.com/swagger-ui/index.html?productname=transfercft&productversion=3.5&filename=transfercft-swagger-api.json#/) which is obviously geared towards REST server APIs\r\n** AMPLIFY Central DevOps API apparently uses [Stoplight|https://stoplight.io/documentation]",
