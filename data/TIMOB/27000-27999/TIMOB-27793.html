   [~jquick] - Looks like that ticket is for adding a new property.   Maybe we can modify that ticket to incorporate this.</li>

   That ticket has the same goal you are looking for. You can choose which corners the borderRadius should be applied to. So, it achieves the same effect. Hans already has a working PR for iOS.
   
   Unless you think it should be implemented in a different way where you can apply a different radius per corner. I'm open to the idea. (We should do one or the other; not both.)</li>

   Perhaps the "borderRadius" property should accept 2 different types?
   
   It can type a numeric value like it does today, which is applied to all corners.
   <code><pre>
   view.borderRadius = 15;  // Applies 15 to all corners.
   </pre></code>
   
   Or you can set it to a dictionary where you can set each corner independently like the below.
   <code><pre>
   view.borderRadius = {
   	topLeft: 15,
   	topRight: 15,
   	bottomLeft: 0,  // Omitting this makes it zero too.
   	bottomRight: 0, // Omitting this makes it zero too.
   };
   </pre></code>
   </li>
</ol>
