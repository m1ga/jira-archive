<h3>Description</h3>

Once we have scripts to generate the guides and/or APIDocs in a docsy-compatible markdown format - we should include ether conversion process into our doctors build process so that when contents change we automatically push the updated export to Open Docs.

We'll have to figure out what the process is that would work best with that team:
- Open a new PR with the updated contents?
- Get commit rights to automatically check in updated contents and push?
- Work with their team to automate syncing updates to docs.axway.com
- Need to handle when we publish here and it goes to docs.axway.com vs the current axway push via crawling our wiki!
