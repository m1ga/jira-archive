<h3>Description</h3>

We've been discussing this at length and have made some informal investigations, but we should carve out time to do a spike and get more data on how feasible it would be to add/replace the layout engine with a box model engine that would support use of CSS properties to style apps.

React Native uses Yoga layout: <a href="https://yogalayout.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://yogalayout.com</a>


Are there other alternatives? Would this effectively break existing apps? How would we manage migrating to a new engine, via some opt-in property/module while we work on maintaining as much backwards compatibility as we can?
