<h3>Description</h3>

We should look into the mapping from CSS box model layout/properties to our existing layout engine properties for views to determine the gap in missing functionality and investigate the feasibility of adding more properties to close the gaps and cover most of the use cases for CSS styling/layouts. If we can support enough of CSS it may be much quicker/easier to approach it this way and simply do mappings of the overwhelmingly most common use cases.

This would stand as an iterative approach apart from TIMOB-27842's more radical layout engine replacement.
