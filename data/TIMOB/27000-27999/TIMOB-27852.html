<h3>Description</h3>

*Summary:*
As of Titanium 9.0.1, a "production" build no longer outputs an AAB (Android App Bundle) file to the distribution directory. The build does create the AAB file under the "build" directory, but not to the desired location.

*Steps to reproduce:*
<h4>Delete the last built APK and AAB files from the distribution folder.</h4>
<h4>Set up a project to build with 9.0.1.</h4>
<h4>Build for "production".</h4>
<h4>Go to the selected "Distribution" folder.</h4>
<h4>Notice the AAB file is missing. Only the APK file is there.</h4>

*Work-Around:*
The AAB file can be found under the following folder instead...
<code><pre>
./build/android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/aap-release.aab
</pre></code>

   Hah, I recently wondered if this was by design. Thx for this! </li>

   Yeah, this was an embarrassing one. This was caused by us updating to the newest gradle tool versions and Google has renamed the outputted AAB file. I've changed our build system to trigger a build failure if we fail to find the build artifacts. And I've asked QE to update the smoke test procedure to delete the last built APK/AAB files before doing the build. That should prevent this from happening again in the future.</li>
