<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Description</h4>

Currently when the liveview app code can't connect to the server it will spam errors (this will be improved in 9.1.0), however we should make sure that these errors also are not reported to ACA.

LiveView currently has a shim that overrides the old APM module that would make the functions a no-op, although I think that is too brute forcey. I think we are best to maybe try to suppress these errors somehow (probably by just handling them better), and then lastly trying to detect the error somehow in liveview and suppress if it is a liveview. (maybe we could prefix all errors with LIVEVIEW and check for that before sending onto ACA)
