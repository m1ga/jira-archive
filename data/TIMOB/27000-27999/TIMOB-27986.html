<h3>Description</h3>

iOS does not support .xcframework binaries so far (available since WWDC 2019). All modern libraries are only available as .xcframeworks, so Titanium devs currently cannot use those libraries. Please fix this asap.

   We may need some more definition on this one. We are moving to xcframeworks to support macOS - both in our our modules are built and the internal libraries/TitaniumKit. But I don't think we've added support for "dropping in" an xcframework in something like a module's platform folder or an app.</li>

   Tested locally with ti.barcode build. Merged to master, 9_2_X backport merged as well.</li>

   For me the solution mentionned didn't work, included with new 9.3.1.GA SDK.
   I solved the problem by excluding arm64 architecture from simulator build in my module's .xcodeproj file.
   Follow the steps mentionned in the accepted answer on this post to exclude arm64 architecture for simulators : <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63607158/xcode-12-building-for-ios-simulator-but-linking-in-an-object-file-built-for-io" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63607158/xcode-12-building-for-ios-simulator-but-linking-in-an-object-file-built-for-io</a> 
   
   I had to dowgrade to 9.0.0.GA SDK to have a more explicit error message that led me on the good track.
