<h3>Description</h3>

I have seen several suggestions over the years to integrate support for the native share sheets into the Titanium SDK.   I've seen some modules floating around like the one shared by Ricardo here:  <a href="https://github.com/ricardoalcocer/socialshare" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/ricardoalcocer/socialshare</a> but they are really old and I am not sure they work with current versions of the framework. 

It would be great to have native modules for iOS and Android that ship with the SDK similar to how Ti.identity and others do.

   You can easily do this on Android via a share intent. No native module required. You can already do this via Titanium's core JavaScript APIs now.
   
   This is really only a limitation on the iOS side. Apple has deprecated ShareKit. I don't know if there is an official replacement.</li>

   Not as familiar with the native side but others seem to be using UIActivityViewController.   Is that related to the ShareKit you mentioned?</li>
<li>Joshua Quick 2020-07-14

   Yeah, it looks like <code>UIActivityViewController</code> is your only option on iOS.</li>
