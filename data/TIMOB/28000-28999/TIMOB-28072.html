<h3>Description</h3>

Apple has stated that  "App updates must be built with the iOS 13 SDK starting June 30, 2020" .  See the section 'Build with Xcode 11' from [here](<a href="https://developer.apple.com/ios/submit/)." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://developer.apple.com/ios/submit/).</a>
Though it will be breaking change, but I think we can drop it before (probably in 9.2.0) because -
1. As per apple's statement, I think no one will be using Xcode < 11.
2. XCFramework is supported in XCdoe 11+, which we require to completely fix TIMOB-28042.
3. MacCatalyst is supported in Xcode 11+, which is required for TIMOB-27132 .

   So should we also make iOS 13 the new minimum target iOS version? It says they need to be built with iOS 13 SDK, but I'm not sure if the "built with" minimum differs from the "target" minimum? Does that really just means we must be Xcode 11+, but the "min" iOS sdk can still be 9.x or whatever as a target?

   RE: iOS min, note that according to our typical sources, we likely should make 12 the minimum:

   1. minimum target iOS version (deployment target) is, what minimum iOS support is available. 
   2. iOS SDK minimum, which comes with Xcode, is minimum Xcode with which app can be developed.
   3. We can set minimum iOS sdk  to 13.0 (Xcode 11) and minimum iOS target to 10.0.
   4. I don't think we can set minimum iOS target to 13.0 (at least not in minor release). There is TIMOB-28011 to discuss this.</li>
