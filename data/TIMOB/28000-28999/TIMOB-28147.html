<h3>Description</h3>

App Clips may be the entry point for retail that have never jumped the App service to cater to on-premise , proximity temporary apps.

<a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-clips/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://developer.apple.com/app-clips/</a>

They are small (10 mb apps) that doesn’t need to be downloaded from the App Store and can be used instantly.
Even though Android has thé équivalant Instant Apps, such features would enhance greatly and bring up to speed a feature that will be ubiquitous. Even more so than regular full on apps (which are still required even for an App Clip to be attached to it).

If it is possible to do so in Ti, an Example on Axway’s Developer blog would spread it faster among us developers.

   I did a quick PoC of this and it seems like an app clip is a target of an app (good, because thats supported in Titanium), but it's an "app target" (like tvOS and watchOS), with own source files, plist, build settings etc. 
   
   The watchOS implementation in Titanium is quite hacky and restricted to watchOS code only, so that would need to be adapted to be more generic. It would also bring tvOS support as well, but is mainly CLI work, not native code work.</li>

   Any update here? If we could link it manually via Xcode would be fine already, but for that, the long term issue of opening generated Xcode projects needs to be fixed before.</li>

   I dug into the topic and there are only two steps remaining to support this:
   1. The linking into the "Embedded content and libraries" is missing (simple entry to copy from the watchOS handling)
   2. The app clip needs to be copied into build/iphone
   
   That's it! And since App Clips are primarily written in SwiftUI, we don't even need to care about framework- or resources-handling.</li>

   To test: Create a new App Clip target in Xcode (like every other app extension as described [here](<a href="https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides2/Creating+iOS+Extensions+-+Siri+Intents)." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides2/Creating+iOS+Extensions+-+Siri+Intents).</a> Everything else is done automatically :-)</li>

   Can't wait to give this a spin!</li>
