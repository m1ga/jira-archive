<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Description</h4>

When installing an SDK on Windows an EPERM error occurs when extracting the SDK, this is happening due to us now respecting symlinks on extraction. By default symlinks require administrator access to be created, or for [developer mode](<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/get-started/enable-your-device-for-development)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/get-started/enable-your-device-for-development)</a> to be enabled.

I think internally the SDK extraction code needs to check if we're on Windows and pass a type of <code>junction</code> to the symlink call

To workaround this, run command prompt as an administrator and it will install just fine

   Note to self, junction wont work as it's only for directories. We probably just want to copy the files</li>
<li>Ewan Harris 2020-11-26

   Can't copy the files directly as it's possible that we extract the symlink-ed file before we extract the source file. So we either need to just ignore symlinks completely on Windows, or defer the copy until we extract the source file later on</li>
