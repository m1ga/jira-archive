<h3>Description</h3>

*Summary:*
Hyperloop's generated JS code for a Java subclass does not expose its Java super class' public static methods and static constants. Only the instance methods/fields are exposed to the subclass.

This is needed to avoid issues, such as with Google's "SnackBar" shown below.
<a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/hyperloop-examples/commit/00f4c1d20747ee5adfacbf2d0cb26dba644c8a43" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/hyperloop-examples/commit/00f4c1d20747ee5adfacbf2d0cb26dba644c8a43</a>

*Note:*
If the subclass has a static method/field of the same name as it's super class, then the subclass' method/field should take priority. This is legal in Java and is known as "shadowing".

*Work-Around:*
You must access the super class' static methods/fields directly from the super class itself.
