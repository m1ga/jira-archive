<h3>Description</h3>

Xcode 9 finally includes support for wireless debugging of iOS- and tvOS-based apps. We should support the same in Titanium from both CLI and Studio.

   I figured out a way to do wireless debugging a while ago. Not sure if this feature will affect the way I was thinking we could do it.</li>

   Hi guys. Any hints on how to enable this on Xcode 9 for Ti apps?

   [~ygbr] No idea how it works for native iOS apps and I have no idea if our debugger today supports it. I know you can launch Safari and see the iOS device somewhere in the Developer menu, but I don't recall if that was over USB or WiFi.
   
   What I found was a way for node-ios-device (which uses the private MobileDevice.framework) to detect if it sees the device over USB or WiFi. I built node-ios-device not knowing it treated USB and WiFi devices differently. I use the UDID to track the devices and filter out all non-USB devices (<a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/node-ios-device/blob/master/src/runloop.cpp#L71)." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/node-ios-device/blob/master/src/runloop.cpp#L71).</a> I actually should be using the interface type and the UDID to uniquely identify a device. Once I fix this, which won't be anytime soon (maybe Q3 or Q4?), then we should be able to support debugging over WiFi. It will require a bit of hacking on our part and a bit of luck.</li>

   You can use [ios-deploy](<a href="https://github.com/ios-control/ios-deploy/)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/ios-control/ios-deploy/)</a> to support wireless installs. Would be great to be incorporated into ioslib / node-ios-device.
   
   *EDIT*: Two additional things:
   
   1. This should be moved to TIMOB, since this is not a studio thing
   2. Here is an example to use wireless installs today:
   <code><pre>
   ➜  my-app git:(master) ✗ ios-deploy --justlaunch --debug --bundle build/iphone/build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/MyApp.app
   [....] Waiting for iOS device to be connected
   [....] Using 00008020-001435260A28002E (D321AP, iPhone XS, iphoneos, arm64e) a.k.a. 'iPhone from Hans'.
   ------ Install phase ------
   [  0%] Found 00008020-001435260A28002E (D321AP, iPhone XS, iphoneos, arm64e) a.k.a. 'iPhone from Hans' connected through WIFI, beginning install
