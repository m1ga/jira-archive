<h3>Description</h3>

As per discussion in architecture meeting, should we set minimum iOS target to iOS 12 in titanium SDK?

The apple data shows that most of the devices are moved to iOS 13.

[~gmathews] has shared past 3 months analytics data for iOS versions, which shows the people are not using iOS < 12.

   I have to be noisy again, sorry for that! Please, as a heavy-user with a 6-digit user base and extensive Analytics on the active device, do not remove this, yet. If there isn't a huge benefit for raising it (like preventing you from implementing new APIs in SDK 10), please do this in SDK 11 later this year. It was fine and correct to raise it from 10 to 11 (also in SDK 10), but bumping two versions in one major version seems hard to cover for larger user bases.
   
   The consequence for us would definitely be to revive our fork and share it actively with others in the same situation, but that shouldn't be the best move. If people want to target iOS 12 as their minimum already, they can use the <code>&lt;min-ios-ver&gt;12.0&lt;/min-ios-ver&gt;</code> property in the tiapp.xml and have a happy life.
   
   I hope this makes sense and convince you wait just a few more months (and one more device iteration in September) before bumping it. I'm completely on board for the next major!</li>

   [~hknoechel] Do you have any data/analytics that suggest iOS 11 is a large user base? Because all indications we have from our analytics, Apple's App Store analytics, and 3rd-party data online all suggest that iOS 11 usage is nearly non-existent.

   Anecdotally, we found that most devices tended to get pegged to older iOS versions due to Apple's constraints and that was why we left iOS 10 as minimum for a longer cycle/release history than in the past (there was a chunk of older iPad usage pegged to it). iOS 11 is not one of those versions, basically any device that could do iOS 11 could upgrade to iOS 12 - and Apple even sent out the latest iMessage security patch as an iOS 12 update/patch release.

   Sure! We have 1.875 % of our users running on iOS 11.x (mostly 11.4.x). I think it's good and correct to be able to target iOS 12 as a minimum, but forcing it while thousands of user are still using it sounds wrong to me.
   
   *EDIT*: Filtering out unique users and only considering users since 2020, we are at <= 0.95 %. So thats probably okay to do. Go ahead if it brings a real benefit!</li>

   Merged to master for 10.0.0 target</li>
