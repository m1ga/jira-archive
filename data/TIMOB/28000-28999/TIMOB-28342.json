					"body": "I have to be noisy again, sorry for that! Please, as a heavy-user with a 6-digit user base and extensive Analytics on the active device, do not remove this, yet. If there isn't a huge benefit for raising it (like preventing you from implementing new APIs in SDK 10), please do this in SDK 11 later this year. It was fine and correct to raise it from 10 to 11 (also in SDK 10), but bumping two versions in one major version seems hard to cover for larger user bases.\r\n\r\nThe consequence for us would definitely be to revive our fork and share it actively with others in the same situation, but that shouldn't be the best move. If people want to target iOS 12 as their minimum already, they can use the {{<min-ios-ver>12.0</min-ios-ver>}} property in the tiapp.xml and have a happy life.\r\n\r\nI hope this makes sense and convince you wait just a few more months (and one more device iteration in September) before bumping it. I'm completely on board for the next major!",
