<h3>Description</h3>

On Android, images in annotations views are not visible. It seems like they are ignored, but don't throw any error or warning. I did some background checks and it seems like this is a long-standing issue:
- AC-1999 
- MOD-2240
- TIMOB-12938

Both were closed as "Cannot reproduce", but for us it's definitely reproducible. Josh and Gary have access to our repo, so they will be able to reproduce it there.
