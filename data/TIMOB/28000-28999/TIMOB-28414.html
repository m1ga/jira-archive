   [~hknoechel] is this constantly occurring for you? I'm able to find builds ok with that command with both Titanium CLI 5.2.3 and 5.3.0. Although I am running on mac, are you on linux? So <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/12697" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/12697</a> would probably apply
   
   I don't think the artifacts from the action builds can be used as they aren't exactly the same as the CI builds uploaded to Jenkins:
   
   * Artifacts only have a [maximum retention period of 90 days ](<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/usage-limits-billing-and-administration#artifact-and-log-retention-policy)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/usage-limits-billing-and-administration#artifact-and-log-retention-policy)</a>
   * Currently they are not "indexed" in any manner like the builds uploaded to S3, so there is no way to perform the branch lookup.
   
   Given the retention period issue I don't think it's possible to move to artifacts for the branch builds.
   
   The GA releases however have been moved to reference GitHub releases rather than the ones stored on S3, so they will be downloaded from there, although the mobilesdk server is still involved in some manner to redirect correctly. I believe ultimately they will be referenced directly in some manner in the future</li>

   Yep, occurring since about 1-2 weeks and for both "ti sdk install -b 10_0_X" and "ti sdk install 9.3.2.GA"</li>

   If you run <code>ti sdk -r</code> do you see the releases listed? The mobilesdk server performs a 302 redirect to the json file so is there anything like a proxy that might block that, you could also try cURL-ing the URL directly to see if it's a connectivity issue <code>curl -L <a href="https://f4df0833a1352ef193633d85356e6e80ffcdcdb7.cloudapp-enterprise.appcelerator.com/api/mobilesdk/branches/X" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://f4df0833a1352ef193633d85356e6e80ffcdcdb7.cloudapp-enterprise.appcelerator.com/api/mobilesdk/branches/X</a></code> should return a response with a branches array and a defaultBranch, <code>curl -L <a href="https://f4df0833a1352ef193633d85356e6e80ffcdcdb7.cloudapp-enterprise.appcelerator.com/api/mobilesdk/releases/X" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://f4df0833a1352ef193633d85356e6e80ffcdcdb7.cloudapp-enterprise.appcelerator.com/api/mobilesdk/releases/X</a></code> should return the releases</li>

   Yes, the "-r" option lets me all all results</li>
<li>Ewan Harris 2021-04-09

   Given that those work fine, I'm going to guess that for some reason the builds are being filtered out [here](<a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium/blob/5701d17fba351981cc71cf12bf583cfab14b0228/lib/commands/sdk.js#L1410-L1423)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium/blob/5701d17fba351981cc71cf12bf583cfab14b0228/lib/commands/sdk.js#L1410-L1423)</a>, which makes no sense to me as you're running mac. Maybe try add some logging around there (I think <code>which ti</code> should help you find the right place) and see if the branch builds are being returned correctly and if they're then being filtered out?</li>
