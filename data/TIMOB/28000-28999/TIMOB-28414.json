So https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/12697 would probably apply\r\n\r\nI don't think the artifacts from the action builds can be used as they aren't exactly the same as the CI builds uploaded to Jenkins:\r\n\r\n* Artifacts only have a [maximum retention period of 90 days |https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/usage-limits-billing-and-administration#artifact-and-log-retention-policy]\r\n* Currently they are not \"indexed\" in any manner like the builds uploaded to S3, so there is no way to perform the branch lookup.\r\n\r\nGiven the retention period issue I don't think it's possible to move to artifacts for the branch builds.\r\n\r\nThe GA releases however have been moved to reference GitHub releases rather than the ones stored on S3, so they will be downloaded from there, although the mobilesdk server is still involved in some manner to redirect correctly. I believe ultimately they will be referenced directly in some manner in the future",
