   The three blockers we noticed so far are:
   - TIMOB-28488
   - TIMOB-28523
   - TIMOB-28524</li>
<li>Ewan Harris 2021-08-17

   Using Xcode 13 Beta 5 and iOS 15 Beta 5
   
   Verified building ks-v2 and hyperloop-examples to stated targets. Validated debugging to iOS sim and device (VS Code and Studio). Validated module building (objective-c and swift based)
   
   TIMOB-28523 can be seen in ks-v2
   
   I'll keep this ticket open til we get a GM and then perform the same again</li>

   I tested kitchensink-v2 and hyperloop-examples on iOS 15 with what's currently on "master" and it works fine.
   
   _(I did notice hyperloop-example's "Video Player" sometimes caused a random crash, but this is currently true on iOS 14 as well. Not an iOS 15 related issue.)_</li>

   [~lchoudhary], we should do the ticket's recommended tests with the RC version of 10.1.0 before closing this ticket. By then, Jenkins will be updated to use the newest Xcode 13 to build the RC with.</li>
<li>Lokesh Choudhary 2021-09-07

   [~jquick], sounds good.</li>
<li>Lokesh Choudhary 2021-09-16

   Did check for the above mentioned tests & did not find any issues.</li>
<li>Ewan Harris 2021-09-23

   Given that Xcode RC and Xcode GA are identical, closing this out</li>
