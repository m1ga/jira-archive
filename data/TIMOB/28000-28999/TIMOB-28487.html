<h3>Description</h3>

It seems like custom LaunchScreen.storyboard files are not picked up anymore. I can investigate this before the team needs to jump on it, but having it tracked here may helps others

   Using the storyboard and images from TIMOB-19694 I'm unable to reproduce this with Beta 2, [~hknoechel] can you still reproduce? Maybe reset the device Device->Erase All Content and Settings and see if the issue persists? If that doesn't fix it can you please provide a minimal sample as it might be limited to the features you're using (in which case it might be an Xcode bug?)</li>

   It may was a B1 bug. I can recheck the issue and test on device. If you can't reproduce it with your custom LaunchScreen.storyboard in /[app/]platform/ios, it should be fine. Note that I don't use the "default" storyboard that just uses the app icon but an own one that uses a UITabBar component. </li>

   I just retested this against Xcode 13 Beta 3 and iOS 15 Beta 3 and also added a TabBar component to the Storyboard and it displays fine so I'm going to close this out as a Beta 1 bug</li>
