<h3>Description</h3>

We just updated our Titanium toolchain to the latest 10_0_X branch (currently 10.0.1) and noticed that our third party Gradle dependencies fail to install:
<code><pre>
[ERROR] [GRADLE]
[ERROR] [GRADLE] FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.
[ERROR] [GRADLE]
[ERROR] [GRADLE] * What went wrong:
[ERROR] [GRADLE] Execution failed for task ':app:mergeDebugResources'.
[ERROR] [GRADLE] &gt; Could not resolve all files for configuration ':app:debugRuntimeClasspath'.
[ERROR] [GRADLE]    &gt; Could not find com.journeyapps:zxing-android-embedded:3.2.0.
</pre></code> 

Same for others:
<code><pre>
[ERROR] [GRADLE]    &gt; Could not find com.google.android:flexbox:2.0.1.
[ERROR] [GRADLE]    &gt; Could not find com.tapadoo.android:alerter:5.1.2.
[ERROR] [GRADLE]    &gt; Could not find com.github.florent37:viewtooltip:1.2.2.

</pre></code>

   Actually, could it be that this is related to the jCenter shutdown?! I definitely need to verify the dependency repos.</li>

   As it turns out, that was the issue. This can be closed!</li>

   Right. Titanium's jcenter usage was removed in 10.0.1 since it's deprecated. See: [TIMOB-28456]
   
   You can re-add jcenter support via a "build.gradle" (example shown in the above ticket), but it's a ticking time bomb since the jcenter servers will be shutdown in less than a year from now. Most maintained jcenter dependencies have been moved to mavenCentral, but you may have to reference newer versions of those dependencies to access them.
   
   Sorry about the confusion.</li>

   Yeah no worries! We already migrated all our modules and are good to go now!</li>
