<h3>Description</h3>

We recently added the ability to override the user interface style via a app-wide setting (which seems to be a very frequently asked feature) using the 10.0.1+ property <code>Ti.UI.overrideUserInterfaceStyle</code>. While this works fine on iOS, it has some odd glitches on Android:
- Some system colors like the action bar title are correctly changed
- Some other colors (semantic colors set via semantic.colors.json) are not changed
- The dark mode check (<code> Ti.UI.userInterfaceStyle === Ti.UI.USER_INTERFACE_STYLE_DARK </code>) fails

This can be reproduced in our branch / internal pull request. I hope I also find the time to have an isolated test case, but it seems to be a combintion between custom themes and semantic colors which is a bit hard to combine for a simple case.

   We tried to workaround it without any luck so far. Wondering if others experience this as well.</li>
