<h3>Description</h3>

This was noted by some of our users. The app icon itself is properly centered, but the wrapper / shadow remains at the top left. I wonder if this is a Google- or Titanium issue. The users have a Xiaomi device and run on Android 11. We cannot reproduce this on our Pixel 5 device.

   [~hknoechel], I can't figure out how to reproduce this. I tried it with your Lambus app's adaptive icon and it worked fine on Android 8, 11, and 12. I also re-ran our hyperloop example project which uses an adaptive icon [here](<a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/hyperloop-examples/blob/master/app/platform/android/res/mipmap-anydpi-v26/ic_launcher_round.xml)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/hyperloop-examples/blob/master/app/platform/android/res/mipmap-anydpi-v26/ic_launcher_round.xml)</a> and it works fine too... although it sets the "background" to a solid color which would probably work-around the issue anyways.
   
   I'm not sure what we can do on the Titanium side. We already correctly "center" an adaptive icon in the splash as can be seen below...
   <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/blob/master/android/titanium/res/drawable-v26/titanium_splash_adaptive_icon_background.xml#L7" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/blob/master/android/titanium/res/drawable-v26/titanium_splash_adaptive_icon_background.xml#L7</a>
   
   I don't have a Xiaomi device to test with. Even if I did, all we can do is attempt to find a work-around for what looks like a Xiaomi bug. Is it wrongly applying an "elevation" by default? I don't know.

   If you're able to reproduce this issue, then try removing the "android:roundIcon" attribute from your "tiapp.xml" to see if it's the adaptive icon that is the cause of this drop-shadow issue on the Xiaomi device. The splash will use your normal icon instead via the following splash layout.
