   [<a href="/projects/32238/tickets/3008" title=
   "Ticket #3008">#3008</a> state:fixed-in-qa] Try to accquire a lock
   instead of outright claiming it. We need to be much more careful
   about that with analytics in resume/suspend operations. <a href=

   <div><p>REPO STEPS (based on crash log):</p>
   <p>This one is going to be very tricky to duplicate. What happened
   was that while one of the suspend/shutdown/resume analytics events
   was occurring, a SECOND analytics event was then sent in the middle
   of the analytics request. So, this has to be timed just right:</p>
   <ul>
   <li>Background the app at exactly the right time so that when
   restarted, analytics is queued up</li>
   </ul>
   <p>This time period is probably measured in tenths (or less) of a
   second. One possible way to do this is to force an analytics event
   on the 'resume' notification sent by the app while on a slow
   network.</p></div></li>
