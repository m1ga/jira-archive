<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>We need to resize table view cells in -[TiUITableViewCell
prepareForReuse] to get the maximum efficiency out of reuse of
cells; this includes resizing contents, making sure dropped views
are "properly" deallocated by their proxies, and so forth.</p>
<p>Right now there's a slap patch which resizes table cells to a
"sensible" size before reuse, but exactly what constitutes a
"sensible" size should be determined by the tableview row (for
example, based on the row's layout, possibly what kinds of views it
contains, is it auto, etc.)</p></div>

   Fairly sure that this has been resolved as a fix to another bug. Otherwise, can't be resolved until after layout fixes, probably.</li>
