<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>MapView.region and MapView.location seem to be write-only
variables, so I can't get the location from them. Listening for the
regionChanged event, that only fires after the region is changed,
so if the user leaves the map where it is I can't use that
either.</p>
<p>At the moment I'm having to wrap the setLocation call so that it
saves the location to a variable within my app and then calls
setLocation on the app, then the regionChanged event updates that
variable, then getLocation returns that variable, but that seems
messy when the map object could have getLocation built in...</p></div>
