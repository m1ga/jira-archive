		"description": "{html}<div><p>\"Failcase\" is, for example, the Table View Layout 2 test in\nKitchenSink. It's not really a \"failure\" since the test actually\nworks. But behind the scenes a bunch of exceptions -- handled\nexceptions -- are happening, very likely affecting performance.</p>\n<p>You can see it happening if you run KS with <code>&lt;property\ntype=\"bool\" name=\"ti.android.debug\"&gt;true&lt;/property&gt;</code>\nin tiapp.xml. Run <code>adb logcat</code> at the command line, then\n-- with KS running in your emulator -- go to the Views -&gt; Table\nViews -&gt; Layout 2 test. As the test loads, watch logcat\nscrolling by -- you'll end up seeing a ton of exceptions. If you\nthen scroll up and down on the table view in the test, you'll see a\nton more exceptions being logged in logcat.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can watch me doing it here:</p>\n<p><a href=\n\"http://screencast.com/t/FD9E6klYe\">http://screencast.com/t/FD9E6klYe</a></p>\n<p>What's happening is this: Because the image path begins with\nResources/images -- which is one of our standard locations to check\nfor density-specific images -- we do the density image name\nmangling and check to see if the image exists as an Android\nresource. The checking to see if it's a resource uses reflection\n(see <code>TiRHelper.locateResource</code>), and has to accept the\nfact that an exception will be raised if the resource doesn't\nexist. It handles that fine (and sends it to logcat if debug is\nturned on -- which is what we're seeing in that video) and the\nresult is that our <code>loadDrawable</code> method ends up\nsuccessfully finding the image file in the standard file system.\nBut I imagine those exceptions are expensive. The problem is that\n-- unlike successful finds of a resource image -- we do\n<strong>not</strong> cache the failures. So it tries <strong>every\ntime</strong> to load the same image as a resource that doesn't\nexist.</p>\n<p>I think putting images into the Resources/images folder is\nprobably a fairly common pattern for app developers. So we could\nperhaps improvement performance for these people by caching\nresource lookup failures to avoid going through the series of\nexceptions over and over again.</p></div>{html}",
