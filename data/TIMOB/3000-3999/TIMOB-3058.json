		"description": "{html}<div><p>The fail case is the KS -&gt; Controls -&gt; Slider -&gt;\nMin/Max Range test. When you run it, you only see a black\nwindow.</p>\n<p>It's a very strangely written test, and I'm pretty sure it's\nactually a mistake (the way it's written). (Nevertheless, it should\n-- and did -- work.)</p>\n<p>It's strange because when you tap the row to start the test, it\nopens a new window (as do basically all of our KS tests) using\ntabgroup.open(win) (thus that new window is heavy). That window has\nits own url property. And in the JS of that URL, a second window\n(light) is created and opened in order to display the test. (This\nsecond window is obviously totally unnecessary, but anyway...)</p>\n<p>The reason we see a blank window is because it's the heavy\nwindow that is showing. (The JS for the heavy window does not\ncontain any code that puts a view on the window.) The lightweight\nwindow never gets seen. And we can see why in this screen shot of\nsome logcat output that I've annotated:</p>\n<p><a href=\n\"https://skitch.com/billdawson/rpdeu/projects-grep-137x29\">https://skitch.com/billdawson/rpdeu/projects-grep-137x29</a></p>\n<p>So when the lightweight window starts opening, the heavyweight\nwindow hasn't finished opening yet (obviously, since part of the\ncode running when the heavyweight window opens is to open the\nlightweight window.) And when a lightweight window is created\n(constructor of <code>TiUIWindow</code>), it immediately runs\nthrough <code>handleWindowCreated</code> and\n<code>handleBooted</code>, thus putting out its layout right away.\nMeanwhile the heavyweight window has to wait until its\n<code>handleBooted</code> gets called. When it does, the\nheavyweight window puts <strong>its</strong> layout on the\nactivity, thus hiding the lightweight window's layout.</p>\n<p>So the test is bizarre and probably should be changed. But the\nuse case of having a heavy open a light immediately is perhaps\nvalid. Like maybe the heavy's code checks some condition and if it\nexists they want to popup a light window for a second to display an\nelaborate message with an OK button that closes the light so its\nre-shows the heavy.</p>\n<p>'N' stuff, and yeah but no but yeah but no.</p></div>{html}",
