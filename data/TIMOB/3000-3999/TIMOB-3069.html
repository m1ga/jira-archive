<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>As per <a href=
"<a href="http://developer.appcelerator.com/question/106211/how-to-set-minimumosversion-to-40" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://developer.appcelerator.com/question/106211/how-to-set-minimumosversion-to-40</a>">
this Q&amp;A post</a> and subsequently discussed with Blain,
request a way to help prevent apps from being purchsed in error for
devices that are not supported.</p>
<p>Adding the setting to a <code>info.plist</code> file in the
project root is unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Workaround suggested until this functionality is provided is to
amend the SDK <code>info.plist</code> template with the desired
<code>MinimumOSVersion</code> value.</p></div>

   but find that it does not work on their device.</p></div></li>

   User has pushed to app store with 1.8.0-20110916080725 and the app is showing in the app store as "Requires iOS 3.1 or higher"</li>
