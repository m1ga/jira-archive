<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>I randomly get "Audio queue creation failed. err: !fmt
560360820" errors. There is no special system for when they pop up,
but it occurs quite often. The error itself is not a big problem,
but once this error occurs many things in the app break.</p>
<p>In my situation it breaks functions and animations. For example,
appending, animating or removing a view will be very buggy.</p>
<pre>

</pre>
<p>This error occurs in one of my apps, and after the error it
really becomes useless and everything gets messed up. Seeing how
this error randomly pops up when start() is executed, I created a
project that will try to start a new stream every 10 seconds. Doing
so you don't have to press button yourself while waiting for the
error, it will however not show how the rest of the app can be
affected by the error. This now hosted on GitHub and can be found
