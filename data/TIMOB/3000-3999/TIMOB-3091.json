		"description": "{html}<div><p>I randomly get \"Audio queue creation failed. err: !fmt\n560360820\" errors. There is no special system for when they pop up,\nbut it occurs quite often. The error itself is not a big problem,\nbut once this error occurs many things in the app break.</p>\n<p>In my situation it breaks functions and animations. For example,\nappending, animating or removing a view will be very buggy.</p>\n<pre>\n<code>2011-01-13 23:32:04.836 Radio HD[10357:6e47] Audio queue creation failed. err: !fmt 560360820 \n[DEBUG] animated called and we're not ready ... (will try again) &gt; \n[DEBUG] animated called and we're not ready ... (will try again) &gt; \n[DEBUG] animated called and we're not ready ...

(will try again) &gt;\n[DEBUG] animation guard triggered, we exceeded the timeout on waiting for view to become ready</code>\n</pre>\n<p>This error occurs in one of my apps, and after the error it\nreally becomes useless and everything gets messed up. Seeing how\nthis error randomly pops up when start() is executed, I created a\nproject that will try to start a new stream every 10 seconds. Doing\nso you don't have to press button yourself while waiting for the\nerror, it will however not show how the rest of the app can be\naffected by the error.
