<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>[A similar ticket, 388, was just set to 'invalid' because of
changes over time. However, none of these issues below have been
addressed. I revalidated these issues today. The attached
screenshot shows several of these issues.]</p>
<p>The appcelerator.com site doesn't give any indication of exactly
what one receives when clicking the "DOWNLOAD TITANIUM" link. The
result page also has no version or file info. The dmg file has no
version info in its filename, and upon mounting and opening,
there's no readme file or other way I could see to determine
exactly what I have downloaded. The only option seems to be to
install the program.</p>
<p>Somewhere (preferably before starting the download, and at every
step along the way) this info should be displayed.</p>
<p>A further cause for confusion is that the mounted-dmg-icon that
appears on the desktop is the same as the actual Titanium app, not
the standard "mounted drive". (See screenshot).</p></div>

   <div><p>Not an issue for the mobile team. This is an issue for our web
   developers and packagers.</p>
   <p>Ralf, can you pass this on to them and invalidate this
   ticket?</p></div></li>

   SDK distribution now handled exclusively through Titanium Studio (and CI builds, and CLI). Gives some indication of what is being installed.</li>
