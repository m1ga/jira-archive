<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>Recreate the fail case:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Create a new mobile project in Developer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you are finished creating it, you'll notice that the
"Application Icon" is set to our standard, which is appicon.png.
You'll see appicon.png in the filesystem under Resources/iphone and
Resources/android.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When sitting at the project edit screen for the
just-created-and-saved project, click "Save Changes" even though
you have not changed anything.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click on the "Test &amp; Package" tab. But don't launch the
app.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click back on the "Edit" tab.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Look at the "Application Icon" field. It will now say
"default_app_logo.png". If you look in the filesytem, you'll see
Resources/default_app_logo.png (it wasn't there before you clicked
Save Changes).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What's happening? The code in Developer is checking your entry
for Application Icon (which was set to appicon.png) and checking to
see if that file exists in the Resources folder. Well it
<strong>doesn't</strong> exist in the Resources folder, it exists
in Resources/iphone and Resources/android. Not seeing it in
Resources, Developer then copies out the file default_app_logo.png
file to Resources and resets the Application Icon field to
default_app_logo.png.</p>
<p>appicon.png and default_app_logo.png are basically the same
image, which is why we really haven't noticed this weirdness
before. But the image in default_app_logo.png is 512x512, whereas
the image in Resources/android/appicon.png is 128x128 and the image
in Resources/iphone/appicon.png is 57x57.</p>
<p>The large size of default_app_logo.png has caused a problem for
the first time in Android: see ticket <a href=
"/projects/32238/tickets/3104" title="Ticket #3104">#3104</a>.</p></div>

   <div><p>I have a (very simple) fix already but haven't pushed it,
   because I know we treat changes to Developer with special care.
   It's in the attached diff.</p>
   <p>I propose we add this to 1.3.0, because anybody who tests out
   our Urban Airship module for Android is going to run into a very
   ugly bug (#3104) that gives no indication whatsoever what the
   problem is (it took me a long time to figure out what was
   happening.)</p></div></li>
