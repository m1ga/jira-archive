<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Problem</h4>

Platform specific JavaScript files are not considered when the build scripts decide what modules to exclude. That means if you only use Ti.UI.createWindow in a platform specific JavaScript file, you will NOT be able to deploy to device.

NOTE: This will ONLY show up when you deploy to device! The simulator build scripts don't exclude modules, so this bug will not show up there.

<h4>Error</h4>

When deploying to device, the following error will pop up:

<code><pre>
Application Error
invalid method (createWindow) passed to UIModule at createWindow.js (line 2)
</pre></code>

<h4>Sample Code</h4>

Place the following in your Resources/app.js. Note that you can uncomment the last line to force the build scripts to include Ti.UI.Window.

<code><pre>
// include a file that attempts to create a new window
// if this file is in the platform build folder, its content won't be used to decide what modules to include
Ti.include('createWindow.js');

// so if we explicitly specify "we're going to use Ti.UI.Window", this program will work
// but if you comment out the following line, and deploy to device, this app will NOT work
//Ti.UI.createWindow;
</pre></code>

Now place the following in Resources/iphone/createWindow.js. Note that if you move it to Resources/createWindow.js (out of the iphone folder), everything will work.

<code><pre>
var win = Ti.UI.createWindow({
    backgroundColor: '#0f0'
});
win.open();
</pre></code>

If everything works (if the bug is NOT present), you will see a window with a green background.

<h4>Tested On</h4>

Titanium SDK version: 1.6.0 (02/10/11 14:34 9db0685...)
WORKS on iPhone Simulator 4.2
BROKEN on iPod Touch 3rd Generation
WORKS on Android Device 2.1 (when placed in Resources/android folder)

<h4>Workaround</h4>

Either move the code out of the iphone folder, or explicitly force Titanium to include the components that are being excluded by placing the following in your app.js:

<code><pre>
Ti.UI.createWindow; // note that we don't actually call this function; just a reference is enough
</pre></code>

   The issue has not been resolved as of 2.0.1.GA</li>
<li>Chris Barber 2016-08-19

   Resolving this ticket as invalid. In Titanium SDK 3.0.0, we correctly overlay platform specific JS on top of non-platform specific code, then parse and walk the AST to find the native modules being used. This shouldn't be an issue anymore.</li>
