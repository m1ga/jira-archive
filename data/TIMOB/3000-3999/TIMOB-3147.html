<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>If calling the Ti.Facebook.dialog method to let the user post
something to their feed and click the Skip button I assume I should
get the cancelled = true in the event object. Otherwise there is no
way to tell if the user went through with the post.</p>
<p>Below is the output in the console when the user clicked
Skip</p>
<p><a href="/projects/32238/changesets/INFO" title=
"Changeset [INFO]">[INFO]</a> dialogCompleteWithUrl =
fbconnect://success</p>
<p><a href="/projects/32238/changesets/INFO" title=
"Changeset [INFO]">[INFO]</a> Received publish stream response =
{<a href="">type</a></p>
<p>and here is the same output when they clicked Post</p>
<p><a href="/projects/32238/changesets/INFO" title=
"Changeset [INFO]">[INFO]</a> dialogCompleteWithUrl =
fbconnect://success/?post_id=618961171_133961986669614</p>
<p><a href="/projects/32238/changesets/INFO" title=
"Changeset [INFO]">[INFO]</a> Received publish stream response =
{<a href="">type</a></p>
<p>In both scenarios success is set to true, the only thing that
differs is the post?id parameter in the url, but I don't think we
have access to that. The correct behavior shuld be that cancelled =
true when the user clicks "Skip". The same thing should for the
login scenario, this I haven't tried. I've only tried this with iOS
4.2</p></div>

   output part again.</p>
   <p>Below is the output in the console when the user clicked
   Skip</p>
   <pre>
   <code>[INFO] dialogCompleteWithUrl = fbconnect://success
   
   [INFO] Received publish stream response = {"type":"result","source":{},"url":{},"success":true,"cancelled":false}</code>
   </pre>
   <p>and here is the same output when they clicked Post</p>
   <pre>
   <code>[INFO] dialogCompleteWithUrl = fbconnect://success/?post_id=618961171_133961986669614
   
   [INFO] Received publish stream response = {"type":"result","source":{},"url":{},"success":true,"cancelled":false}</code>
