<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>The current implementation as I see it down in the objective c
code, only allows for a non Safari option when a non multi-tasking
enabled device calls into the module. What about when a device has
been locked down, by restricting Safari, thus removing it from the
device? The Facebook module should detect this at least, or should
enable the app to specify that the authenticate method should use a
webview, or FBDialog like interface. Webviews are not restricted
when Safari has been. The have no url input area and so are
restricted to some degree. Parents want to restrict the ability of
the device to browse to inappropriate web sites. This is very
common with apps with a target audience of younger teens and
pre-teens.</p></div>

   Has this been tested in the wild? The new code tries launching facebook, then tries launching Safari, then tries the dialog. Key here is that if the safari launch fails due to parental controls, the app knows and flows through to the dialog.</li>
