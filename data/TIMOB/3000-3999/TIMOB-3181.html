<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>Hello,<br>
the mdfind command in the builder.py makes the things very slow, in
1.6.0.RC1 in line 1017 (results = run.run(['mdfind',...)<br>
I waited only once about a half hour, that's a little bit too slow
for me xD (my mac isn't the problem, everything else is always fine
with the performance, but not this one). Then I changed the whole
"cleanup_app_logfiles" function to a comment. Now it works fine for
me.</p>

   <div><p>This issue has also caused me trouble. It will occasionally take
   about 45 minutes for an app to build (compared to normally taking
   only a couple of seconds for the same app). As a temporary fix I
   have also commented out the cleanup_app_logfiles function.</p></div></li>
