<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>When a SplitWindow changes orientation the title image on the
"master window" (if it has been set to have one) will be shrunken
to about 1px in width. This happens when the device is rotated from
landscape (where the master window is visible) to portrait (where
is animated to the closed position).</p></div>

   <div><p>This seems to be a more serious issue than I first realised.
   There also seems to be some situations in which the master window
   has resized completely incorrectly. E.g when rotating the master
   window it can become about half the height and double the width it
   should be.</p></div></li>

   Closing ticket due to the time passed and lack of progress for a number of years. Any problems, please file a new ticket.</li>
