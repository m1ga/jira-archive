<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>Hi,<br>
I would like to see support of GridView in Titanium.<br>
Currently the only way to do something similar is to emulate it
with a TableView and internal views, but this brings performance,
usability problems and a non-native experience.</p>
<p>Something like<br></p>
<pre>
<code class="javascript">// create grid view
var gridView = Titanium.UI.Android.createGridView({ data:data });</code>
</pre>
would be desirable.</div>

   Why not bring this into the SDK?

   CollectionView on iOS and GridView on Android is very much used in the native world. They are powerful and have such great flexibility. By now, this should be a must have in any cross platform SDK.

   or CardViews inside a RecyclerView in the form of a GridLayout. 
   There are many use cases for this feature. </li>

   Something like a waterfall layout for grids will be much appreciated for Android - right now there's no easy way to do that. Using Scrollviews makes the app impossible to scroll - very bad UX.</li>
