<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I've written a number of modules that have worked fine in 1.5.1,
but now have issues with SBJSON and the collection of JSON classes
since upgrading to 1.6.</p>
<p>I notice that there is a top-level to do in the template to fix
the heavily customised SBJSON at a later date. Can I suggest that
this is a high priority?</p>
<p>At this point I'm not entirely sure how I would have to modify
the modules I've written to accommodate the Ti customisations. I've
invested a lot of time and effort in my module code, so I will have
to stick to 1.5.1 until this is resolved.</p>
<p>An updated date for a fix would be appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Byron</p></div>
