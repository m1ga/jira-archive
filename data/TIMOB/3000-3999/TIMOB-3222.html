<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>Hi,<br>
I'm building an iPad app using Titanium 1.6.0 (it was also the same
in 1.5.1) with the 4.2 iPhone SDK.</p>
<p>I have a file with a function which can be called to create a
Video Player view (see a simple test case in this <a href=
"<a href="http://pastie.org/1604596" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://pastie.org/1604596</a>">pastie</a>). In my main window, I
create two of these video views, each with different videos and
data. When I start playing one of the videos, pause it, and then go
and play the other video it causes both to 'complete'. The click
event to start the second video fires, but once video.play() is
called in the callback, the 'complete' event on both videos is
fired causing both to end.</p>
<p>I thought it may have something to do with my variable
references pointing to the same video object but that isn't the
case as I can log separate data from each of the videos in their
respective 'complete' event listeners.</p>
<p>Expected Behaviour: You should be able to pause one video, go to
another video and press play and it will play straight away, while
the original video retains it's last played position.</p>
<p>Any ideas or thoughts on this? Is this a bug in Titanium? Do
multiple videos need to be in their own window rather than multiple
views in one window?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Pat</p></div>
