		"description": "{html}<div><p>Hi,<br>\nI'm building an iPad app using Titanium 1.6.0 (it was also the same\nin 1.5.1) with the 4.2 iPhone SDK.</p>\n<p>I have a file with a function which can be called to create a\nVideo Player view (see a simple test case in this <a href=\n\"http://pastie.org/1604596\">pastie</a>). In my main window, I\ncreate two of these video views, each with different videos and\ndata. When I start playing one of the videos, pause it, and then go\nand play the other video it causes both to 'complete'. The click\nevent to start the second video fires, but once video.play() is\ncalled in the callback, the 'complete' event on both videos is\nfired causing both to end.</p>\n<p>I thought it may have something to do with my variable\nreferences pointing to the same video object but that isn't the\ncase as I can log separate data from each of the videos in their\nrespective 'complete' event listeners.</p>\n<p>Expected Behaviour: You should be able to pause one video, go to\nanother video and press play and it will play straight away, while\nthe original video retains it's last played position.</p>\n<p>Any ideas or thoughts on this? Is this a bug in Titanium? Do\nmultiple videos need to be in their own window rather than multiple\nviews in one window?</p>\n<p>Thanks,</p>\n<p>Pat</p></div>{html}",
