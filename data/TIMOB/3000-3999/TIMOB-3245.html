<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>The relevant code in Titanium is only hit if you start an app
from a download such as from the Android Market. And it's only in a
Log statement. I noticed it was removed from Android because I
looked at this:</p>
<p><a href=
"<a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/api_diff/11/changes/android.app.Activity.html#android.app.Activity.getInstanceCount_removed()" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://developer.android.com/sdk/api_diff/11/changes/android.app.Activity.html#android.app.Activity.getInstanceCount_removed()</a>">
<a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/api_diff/11/changes/android.app.Ac..." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://developer.android.com/sdk/api_diff/11/changes/android.app.Ac...</a></a></p>
<p>To test what happens when it's called in Honeycomb, I put a
bogus call to it in a piece of code that I know runs all the time
when an app launches. The result is this crash:</p>
<pre>
<code>E/AndroidRuntime(  476): FATAL EXCEPTION: main
E/AndroidRuntime(  476): java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: org.appcelerator.titanium.TiLaunchActivity.getInstanceCount</code>
</pre>
<p>So I simply removed it from the Log statement where it's called.
There's nothing to test, really.</p></div>

   <div><p>(from <a href=

   Remove call to getInstanceCount from one log statement as it didn't
   seem too important and it does not exist anymore starting in api 11
   (and therefore would crash in Honeycomb) [<a href=

   <div><p>BTW, I went through the list of all methods deleted from api 11,
   and this was the only one we called, and we called it only in this
   one place.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>I obviously do not fully understand this but is it possible to
   remove the getInstanceCount code from my own project? My app
   currently crashes immediately on load.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>Ignore my comment...I used mobilesdk 1.7 and it worked.
   Thanks.</p></div></li>
