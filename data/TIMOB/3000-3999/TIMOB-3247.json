					"body": "{html}<div><p>I want to highlight this issue as being potentially quite a\nmajor one. As things stand, there is an entire category of app\n(those requiring communication between a web view and the container\napp) that this issue makes it nearly impossible to implement on\nAndroid devices when using Titanium.</p>\n<p>I implemented a pretty basic RSS news feeder app which pulls\ncontent from a server and displays that content using a mixture of\nnative screens and web views. The web views are used to display\nHTML content loaded from the feed. The HTML is generated from the\nfeed contents and is passed to the web view using its 'html'\nproperty (all content is valid HTML). The HTML includes buttons\nwhich, when clicked, request navigation to a new screen by using\nTi.App.fireEvent to raise an application level event.</p>\n<p>Using mobile SDK 1.6, the app worked perfectly on iOS but was\nhopelessly broken on Android as the event handlers (registered\nusing Ti.App.addEventListener) would never receive any events.\nAfter an epic hack session, I eventually coded a work around by\nregistering a click event handler on the web view, re-injecting the\nevent into the web view using evalJS and then extracting the\nrequired Ti.App event by the same route. Even then, I could only\nget the events to their destination by moving the listener\nregistration from the Ti.App object to the web view object, and by\ncalling fireEvent on the web view object once the event had been\ndug out of the web view:</p>\n<pre>\n<code class=\n\"javascript\">// Dig application level events out of the web view when a click event happens\nwebView.addEventListener('click',function() {\n    // This solution requires a load of JS code in the web view.\n    var e = webView.evalJS('injectClickEvent()');\n    if( e ) {\n        e = JSON.parse( e );\n        // Calling Ti.App.fireEvent won't work...\n        webView.fireEvent( e.n, e.e );\n    }\n});\n// This listener on Ti.App won't work...\nwebView.addEventListener('some-application-level-event', myEventHandler );</code>\n</pre>\n<p>This problem seems to exist only for multi-window apps defined\nover multiple files. If I create a trivial app in a single app.js\nlike the following, then it all works OK:</p>\n<pre>\n<code class=\"javascript\">var webView = Ti.UI.createWebView({\n    html:'&lt;html&gt;&lt;input type=\"button\" value=\"test\" onclick=\"Ti.App.fireEvent(\\\"test\\\")\"/&gt;&lt;/html&gt;';\n});\nTi.App.addEventListener('test', function() { ... });\n// etc...</code>\n</pre>\n<p>To reiterate, this was only a problem on Android. Also, the\nproblem does not seem to be confined to the 1.6.0 sdk; I tested on\n1.6.1 and 1.5.1 and had the same issues on both.</p>\n<p>What I'm describing is probably only part of a more fundamental,\nJS scope related problem, as I also encountered occasional problems\nfiring events from within JS closures, but I'm highlighting this\nproblem as it was considerably more difficult to work around.</p></div>{html}",

Tried using touchend events instead, but this crashes the app after a swipe gesture. Upshot is that despite over a month's worth of dev effort on the project, we have given up trying to use Titanium for this and instead will start again and do it natively. This issue - combined with others - make me conclude that Titanium on Android is not stable or reliable. It has some vague but fundamental problems at its core (possibly due to concurrency issues), and there is no sign of these issues being taken seriously by the dev team (presumably because they can't be recreated with simple test cases).",
