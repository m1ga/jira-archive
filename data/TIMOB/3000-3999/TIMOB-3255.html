<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>Hi,</p>
<p>We just created a new app and are planning to create some more
with your platform. Works perfectly execpt for one major point. The
fact that all the scripting is publicly available. We made some
private services with api's for our apps, but as all the scripting
can be found in the apk file, the private services all of a sudden
can become public as everyone can use them. As you can imagine this
is a major porblem.<br>
What we did at the moment is obfuscate some parts, but not only
that is not really secure, it slows down the app a lot as well.</p>
<p>Compiling the javascript nativly would be the best of course,
but I don't see that happen soon. Therefor I was looking at the
encrypted database option and noticed that it was on the roadmap.
Could you please give us an estimated time of arrival of this
feature?</p>
<p>thanks for the project so far and thanks for you time.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Erik</p></div>

   We have improved application code security as part of the ticket TIMOB-8951 and that should take care of the concern here.</li>
