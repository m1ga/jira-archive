<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>At this moment, the only Picker-event is the change-event. A
user, however, can click on a row. If he does so, a blue selection
bar appears. But there is no way to detect that event. Could you
add a 'select'-event so that we can write an event-handler for this
behavior?</p></div>

   I would like to be able to react to such an event as well.  Also, I'd like to see Picker have a 'click' event also, for when the Picker is clicked before the list of choices appears.
   
   I need this for iOS and Android.</li>

   Resolving as <code>Wont Do</code> since Pickers do not have the blue selection bar since iOS 7 anymore and clicks to other rows are properly handed as "change" events.</li>

   Closing as "won't do". If this is in error, please reopen.</li>
