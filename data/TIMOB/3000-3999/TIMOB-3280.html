   <div><p>The cure were worse than the disease, and led to <a href=
   "/projects/32238/tickets/3327" title="Ticket #3327">#3327</a> among
   others. The merge was undone, and so let's reopen this one.</p></div></li>

   (Time was already accounted for in other areas) This has since been fixed since April 15th, but I forgot to update the bug to reflect that. Whoops.</li>
