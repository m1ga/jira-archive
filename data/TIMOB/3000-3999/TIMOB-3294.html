<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>A common exception that terminates an app happens when trying to
manipulate, remove, etc. an array filled with native
objects.<br></p>
<p>One of our customers reports the issue here: <a href=
"<a href="http://developer.appcelerator.com/helpdesk/view/66011#c361894" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://developer.appcelerator.com/helpdesk/view/66011#c361894</a>"><a href="http://developer.appcelerator.com/helpdesk/view/66011#c361894" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://developer.appcelerator.com/helpdesk/view/66011#c361894</a></a></p>
<p>This is something common I've seen across trying to remove an
array of event listeners, native objects stored in a global array,
etc.</p>
<p>Another similar example although not identical is the
scrollableView's 'views' property. If it's populated with 20 views
and then you decide to loop through each one removing them (i.e.
using the remove method) - it can take several seconds on the
device before they are all removed, depending on their contents. If
you try to repopulate the scrollableView's views before they are
removed, it throws an exception and terminates the app ('NSArray
was mutated while being enumerated' or sometimes '0...12 index 14
not found', depending on the context).</p>
<p>The above example can be applied to simply removing views from a
window that are referenced in a global array and then trying to
repopulate that array (or even views that are children of a
view).</p></div>
