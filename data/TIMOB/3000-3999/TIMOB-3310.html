<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>I'm sorry if this has been reported before, I tried searching
but couldn't find anything on this specific issue.</p>
<p>Currently, there seems to be no way to allow standard doubletap
zooming for elements other than WebViews. I have tried using
webviews as ScrollableView elements, but could not figure out a way
to enable events on it without disabling the scroll functionality
of the scrollableview. Forgive me if I'm overlooking something.</p>
<p>Please implement either:<br>
* A way to enable zooming in (to a preset scale) and zooming out
using the doubletap event in ScrollableView (currently, only the
pinch-zoom gesture works, but not the doubletap, which is a pretty
standard and hence intuitive feature at least in iOS). * A way to
set the scale of the current view programmatically, so that we can
listen for the doubletap event in the code and implement this
action from there. This naturally would need to support
animation.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
Rene</p></div>
