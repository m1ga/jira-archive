<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>There doesn't seem to be a way to compress an image or lower its
quality before posting it to a remote server. The images taken by
the iphone 4 are incredibly big and need to be compressed. In Obj-C
I would just do the following:</p>
<p>UIImageJPEGRepresentation(photo, 0.3);</p>
<p>We need something similar for titanium. This is a big
showstopper for anyone trying to have upload image capabilities in
their app. Very surprised no one else has escalated this issue...or
is their a workaround available?</p></div>

   <div><p>Looks like you have modify the Titanium source code to do
   this...which really isn't an acceptable solution. See this

   Uploading photos is extremely common. This would be a much better way to do it than some of the solutions I've seen. Please fix!</li>
