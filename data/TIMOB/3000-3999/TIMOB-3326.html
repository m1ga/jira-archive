<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>I have two strings.xml files in which I write some literals in
order to have a multilingual application. But I have a problem
since yesterday which is the following: I cannot see my app
'writing' the literals in my app, some I added yesterday are not
visible and the name of locales literals are shown instead. I tried
to delete all files from build folder and change tiapp.xml in order
to force a full rebuild but with no luck.<br>
Two more clues:<br>
1. I have forgotten to write in one of these files some literals
and these I added last are not seen but the older ones work
properly.<br>
2. I Android all work properly.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your time.</p></div>
