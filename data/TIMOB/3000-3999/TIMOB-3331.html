   <div><p>I've fixed this in a fork, and have requested a pull request on
   github: <a href=
   "<a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/81" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/81</a>"><a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/81" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/81</a></a><br>
   Hopefully they'll pull the patch, and this should be fixed
   soon.</p>
   <p>If you're feeling adventurous, you can clone my fork and build
   it. :)</p></div></li>

   <div><p>Hi Guys,</p>
   <p>please accept that pull request if it solves the problem. It's
   really annoying when users try to login and their password is saved
   in the dictionary. Many users are complaining about that.</p>
   <p>Thanks and kind regards,<br>
   Dennis</p></div></li>
<li>Shish 2011-04-15

   <div><p>I'm also getting complaints about this, users can't log in
   because their passwords are auto-completed with capital letters
   (Yeah, I know they can override the autocomplete, but <em>they</em>
   don't know that...)</p></div></li>
<li>Don Thorp 2011-04-15

   <div><p>I'm going to look at this, but have you guys tried setting
   <code>autocorrect : false</code> in the creation args of the text
   field? Just trying to narrow it down.</p></div></li>
<li>Jon Alter 2011-04-15

   <div><p>I have tried using autocorrect:false with the same result. Here
   is the textField I used for testing.<br></p>
   <pre>
   <code class=
   "javascript">var passwordField = Ti.UI.createTextField({
           returnKeyType   : Titanium.UI.RETURNKEY_DONE,
           enableReturnKey : true,
           hintText        : 'Password',
           value           : '',
           color           : '#666',
           top             : 50,
           width           : '90%',
           passwordMask    : true,
           autocorrect     : false
   });</code>
   </pre></div></li>

   <div><p>Slipping into 14, can't find a fix that doesn't break other
   features yet.</p></div></li>
<li>vetler (at gmail) 2011-04-15

   <div><p>If it breaks, why is this not commented on the pull request? I
   would be more than happy to fix it.<br>
   <a href=
   "<a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/81" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/81</a>"><a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/81" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/81</a></a></p>
   <p>It should trigger if password masking is enabled, and I don't
   see any obvious reasons not to switch to
   InputType.TYPE_TEXT_VARIATION_PASSWORD.</p></div></li>
<li>Don Thorp 2011-04-15

   <div><p>I'm testing across emulators and devices other than 2.3. If I
   could tell you what to fix, I'd already have fixed it. It looks
   likes like the problem is 2.3 dependent on device. No worries just
   trying to work through all the combinations where the value gets
   set and unset.</p></div></li>
<li>vetler (at gmail) 2011-04-15

    <div><p>Interesting ... I couldn't reproduce the bug in the emulator,
    but showed up on my Samsung Galaxy S. Didn't try other Android
    versions in the emulator than the one I had set up though.<br>
    Is the bug reproducible in the Android emulator at all?</p></div></li>
<li>Don Thorp 2011-04-15

    <div><p>We tested on 2.2.2 and 2.3.1 with the patch and it seems to be
    ok due to the order of when the password mask is applied. Thanks
    @vetler for the patch. Sorry it took this long, but other
    variations I was testing with flags were having some issues. I'm
    not positive there won't be a side-effect if someone tries to
    switch a password field to another field, but that's not the normal
    use case.</p>
