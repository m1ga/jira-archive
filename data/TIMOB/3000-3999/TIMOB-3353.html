<h3>Description</h3>

<div><pre>
<code class="javascript">//Using Titanium 1.6.1 on iOS 4.2

var row = Ti.UI.createTableViewRow();
row.hasChild = true;

var label = Ti.UI.createLabel({
text: "Updating",
textAlign: 'left',
font: {
   fontSize: 13
},
bottom: 5,
height: 16,
left: 10, 
right: 50
});

row.add(label);

//update text after database query
//Case 1:
label.text = "Some long text that would cause it to display on two lines"

//Case 2:
label.text = "Some short text"

//event called after a remote server updated our local info
//this happens in a closure to keep a reference to label
Ti.App.addEventListener('someEvent', function(e) {
    label.text = "Some other long text to display possibly on two lines"
});

// [More code not related ...]
// Add row to a table view, and the table view to the current tab window</code>
</pre>
<p>Test results:<br>
Case 1:<br>
At this moment as the view is attached to the window the label is
displayed on two lines.</p>
<p>The event is triggered, at a later time, the new text is put on
two lines.</p>
<p>Case 2:<br>
At this moment as the view is attached to the window the label is
displayed on one line, since the text is short enough to fit on one
line.</p>
<p>The event is triggered, at a later time, the new text which too
long for a single ine is cut off and '...' attached to the end of
the text</p>
<p>So it looks like the view will not grow automatically at a later
time. I don't know what the intended behavior is.<br>
And I could not find any setting to choose a default behavior.</p>
<p>I hope this is clear enough.<br>
Thank you for your time guys.</p></div>

   Closing ticket due to time passed and lack of progress since 2011. The test case is also invalid.</li>
