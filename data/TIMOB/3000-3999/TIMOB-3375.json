					"body": "While trying to implement an audio player, I've also come against the lack of functionality listed in this issue when it comes to providing a viable product to play remote audio. \r\n\r\nOne of the missing methods is a 'seek' (setTime). Bizarrely the AudioStreamerCUR.m currently used in the Titanium SDK already contains a seekToTime:time method but this has yet to be implemented. \r\n\r\nThe reason that I need a seek is to overcome an issue which occurs when you try and pause a streaming mp3 url with Ti.Media.audioPlayer. What I found was that after resuming the paused audio, the STOPPING and STOPPED events will fire after a few seconds, ending the audio before it should. As if some data in the audio buffer has just been *forgotten*.  So, I wanted to try and take a note of the current progress time when paused, then instead of just 'start'ing the playback again, I'd seek to the paused time and continue playback. (This does require the remote url to support Partial Content, since that's how seekToTime works.)\r\n\r\nDuring the past few days research on the matter, I found a module which employs the same seekToTime method from Matt Gallagher's AudioStreamer library.  It does work, but has some glitches. https://github.com/atsusy/tiaudiostreaming\r\n\r\nThe trouble is, is that the versions being used by this module *and* the Ti SDK are woefully out of date. The Github Network Graph of the AudioStreamer project [ https://github.com/mattgallagher/AudioStreamer/network ] shows many years of improvements. The furthest being Alex Crichton's https://github.com/alexcrichton/AudioStreamer where much mode modern methods are employed and many deprecations removed.  (AudioStreamer was written before Apple even released the iPhone 3GS, in 2008! ;) ) \r\n\r\nThe latest version on his branch also has a host of new features, such as metadata from ShoutCast servers, ID3 tags, etc. \r\n\r\nAfter even further research, I've also found that maybe a solution with AVFoundation/AVPlayer might be worth a shot. I'm going to attempt to build a module (and I don't *do* Objective-C ;) ) and see how I get on.\r\n\r\nK\r\n",
