<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>Please review the Private HD ticket for details on this
issue.</p>
<p><em>Problem</em></p>
<p>The customer's app crashes if you load it on device and click
Missions, and then the back button about 8-16 times (back and
forth). We tried to make a test app that narrowed down the problem,
but we were unsuccessful. It seems there is either a memory leak
when opening and closing windows, or possibly when parsing json.
The test apps that we were able to replicate the issue were usually
paired down from the original app, but when we installed a new
project, we were unable to replicate.</p>

   Upgrade to a more recent V8 engine and fixing proxy objects leak has taken care of this issue.</li>

   There is no sample code, the HS ticket does not return anything for me, and we can't tell who's app this is. What shall we do with this ticket?</li>
