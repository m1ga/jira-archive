<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>App was working an installing fine in 1.6.0. I recently upgraded
to 1.6.1.</p>
<p>Now, I build (in fact do a clean/total rebuild), then move the
.app to iTunes (this is on a MacBook, Mac OS X v10.6.6), by the
usual drag-and-drop method. Perform a sync, and get the following
message, after the app uploads":</p>
<p>The app "xxxxxxxxxx" was not installed on the iPod "yyyyyyyyyy"
because an unknown error occurred (0xE800801C).</p>
<p>The app does not get installed onto the iPod, but is still on
iTunes.</p>
<p>Note, this also happens with the Kitchen Sink app as well.<br>
(Also note, everything works in the iOS/iPhone emulator... no
problem.)</p>
<p>FYI:<br>
Titanium SDK version: 1.6.1<br>
iPhone SDK version: 4.2<br>
Mac OS X version: 10.6.6<br>
(Titanium Developer version: 1.2.2)</p>
<p>Please help!<br>
- Chris</p></div>

   <div><p>Does not seem to be an Apple issue, per se. I load an old
   version of the app, created using Titanium Mobile 1.6.0, onto
   iTunes and it installs and runs fine. This seems to have something
   to do with 1.6.1.</p>
   <p>Is no one else encountering this issue?</p></div></li>
