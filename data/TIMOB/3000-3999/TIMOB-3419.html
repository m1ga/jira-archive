ticket</a> has reported that inserting rows in a SQLite database
takes too long. I have create a sample app and ran it against both
Android and iOS. This is the code: <a href=

milliseconds after the insert.</p>

   This is still the case in 1.7.0/upstream.. Any love/fix coming?</li>

   Significant time has been invested trying to find a speedup. The underlying implementation seems to be the gating factor. More research will be done, but it won't be fixed in 1.7.0. It may not be fixable.</li>

   Any updates on this? Working on a project that could send thousands of insert statements to a user. In an iphone, this takes fractions of a second. In Android this takes quite some time.
   
   using 1.8 sdk</li>

   using this tip i found on stack overflow:
   
   <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1609637/is-it-possible-to-insert-multiple-rows-at-a-time-in-an-sqlite-database." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1609637/is-it-possible-to-insert-multiple-rows-at-a-time-in-an-sqlite-database.</a> See comments 2 and 3.
   
   i was able to cut the time for 10,000 records to about 25 seconds, roughly a 1/3 reduction in time. Which is still significant... but worthwhile to note.
   
   I modified the above user's code to support multiple inserts at a time, in 500 blocks.

   edit: also worth noting that while using this trick, the time for inserts on an iphone went from around 1.3 seconds to about 50ms. Worth using it all around.</li>
