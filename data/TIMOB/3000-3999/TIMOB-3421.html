   <div><p>Same problem.<br>
   Missing icon and version (Version: Unspecified)</p>
   <p>Titanium SDK 1.6.1 and Xcode: 4</p></div></li>

   <div><p>Have the same problem. Have everything ready to upload, just
   waiting for this to be resolved.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>@Gerald You don't need to wait, the app is working fine, it's
   just that only the last version is kept in Xcode.<br>
   It's not very stable though. I have to delete the project in Xcode
   before building another version because sometimes the archive is
   not replaced by nthe newest version.</p></div></li>
<li>Gerald 2011-04-15

   <div><p>Thanks for the quick reply. So what do I have to do to get
   things running? I have deleted the build (everything in this
   folder) but it had no effect.</p></div></li>
<li>Brice 2011-04-15

   <div><p>Ok, in fact I deleted the archive in Xcode organizer, sorry for
   the wrong words of my precedent post.<br>
   Then I build for production and after the build is complete, Xcode
   opens with only one version (unspecified) in the archive section of
   Xcode organizer.<br>
   If I need to build another version, I delete the archive in Xcode
   Organizer because a couple of times the old version was not
   replaced.<br>
   I wonder if it's happening for everybody or no.</p></div></li>
<li>Jick Steen 2011-04-15

   <div><p>I have the same issue here. Deleting the archive in Xcode
   organizer and rebuild it does not fix the issue. Does the icon and
   version appear after the app was approved by apple? Is it just not
   visible in Xcode or later on the device too?</p></div></li>
<li>Brice 2011-04-15

   <div><p>I built an adhoc production app and on the device the icon is
   ok. I think it's just in Organizer that the problem occurs.<br>
   My app is In Review now (rejected because of streaming video &gt;
   10mn without HLS, anyway..) so I'll keep you informed after the app
   is on the app store (or no).</p></div></li>

   <div><p>Bit hasty; going to reopen this while I fix versioning. But the
   app icon issue is resolved.</p></div></li>
