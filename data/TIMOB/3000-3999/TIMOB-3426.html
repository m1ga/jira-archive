<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>As Exif data is stored in photo files created using the device
camera, it can be exploited to simplify apps as the information
does not need to be implemented/duplicated using the DB. Hence,
propose <a href=
"<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/ExifInterface.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/ExifInterface.html</a>">
ExifInterface</a> be considered for inclusion in a future
release.</p>
<p>Note that equivalent functionality is available for iOS from
version 4.0, according to <a href=
"<a href="http://developer.appcelerator.com/helpdesk/view/63941" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://developer.appcelerator.com/helpdesk/view/63941</a>">this HD
ticket</a>.</p>
<p>This request also raised for iOS, in <a href=
"/projects/32238/tickets/3427" title="Ticket #3427">#3427</a>.</p></div>

   <p>There shouldn't be any "bumping" going on in Lighthouse! ;)
   Simply watching a ticket is sufficient to show your interest in it.
   Developers will take the list of watchers into account for very
   popular tickets.</p>
   <p>Thanks for your understanding. :)</p></div></li>

   <div><p>hence the ";)"<br>
   just wanted to point out that this is actually a very useful
   feature. kinda like tcpsockets for android.</p></div></li>

   I believe more than a few people could benefit from the use of this interface. The mentioned ExifInterface seems stable and robust.</li>

   Closing this ticket because I converted the iOS ticket to TiAPI. The first step. This support will most likely not be provide as a feature of the platform but as an additional module. It's status is TBD.</li>
