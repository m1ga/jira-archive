<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>My files where placed in /Resources/iphone and the emulator
builds worked fine but when I did HW builds the application would
crash on start on HW and even subsequent emulator builds.</p>
<p>I traced it down to the build/iphone/Classes/defines.h file
being re-created wrong by the HW build process.</p>
<p>Taking my files our of /Resources/iphone directly into
/Resources fixed the problem.</p>
<p>Titanium SDK 1.2.2, Mobile SDK 1.6.1 and XCode 4 on Mac OS
10.6</p></div>

   This is not a problem just for code put into /Resources/iphone, its a problem for code put into any directory.  For example, all of my code is stored in /Resources/common, and I just have a small app.js that simply executes a single line
   
   app.js
   
   ti.include("common/app_main.js");
   
   common/app_main.js
   
   ti.API.info(titanium.App.id);
   
   This will give an error that Titanium.App is undefined....
   
   But its all because defines.h is created incorrectly at times.  Its unable to figure out the proper dependencies if the code calling that Titanium functions are not in the root of the resources directory.

   This hasn't been an issue in years. I'm sure it was fixed in 3.0.0 and improved since.
   
   Being this ticket refers to Titanium SDK 1.2.2 and <code>ti.include()</code>, I'm marking this issue as invalid.</li>
