<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>"Sluggish performance with static table view"</p>
<ul>
<li>We have used static table view in one of the screens under
titanium based application</li>
<li>When we move onto that screen then sometimes it just doesn't
load completely or sometimes some of the rows doesn't appear.</li>
<li>When we come on this screen then after a moment all the labels
in this table view slid 1px up from its current position - no idea
why?</li>
</ul>
<p>If anybody has any idea about this and some guideline material
as how to optimize performance for titanium application when using
specific controls etc. then please let us know because for
simple/static screens we are facing very slow application
performance for now.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
DPK</p></div>
