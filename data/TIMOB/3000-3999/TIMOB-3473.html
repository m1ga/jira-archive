<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>As described in ticket <a href=
"<a href="http://support.appcelerator.com/tickets/YAJ-53154-797" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://support.appcelerator.com/tickets/YAJ-53154-797</a>">YAJ-53154-797</a>,
Ti.Contacts.getAllGroups() does not return all groups. Seems like
system-managed groups, like "All Contacts", "Mobile Me", etc... are
not returning. But custom contact groups do return.</p>
<p>Test case, create two contact groups on the computer's address
book and sync with iPhone, run this code on app.js:</p>
<pre>
<code>var groups = Titanium.Contacts.getAllGroups();
alert(groups.length);</code>
</pre>
<p>The alert will alert two instead of three (two custom and one
system: All Contacts). And if one of the groups is a Mobile Me
contacts groups, for exmple, it will be ignored.</p>
<p>Tested on Ti SDK 1.6.2<br>
iOS 4.3 Device (iPhone 4)</p></div>

   <div><p>An additional test would be if you have not "created" any groups
   on your own.<br>
   But in Contacts on the device you see 3 groups that are,
   supposedly, system-managed groups like I do ("All contacts"
   "MobileMe" "On My Mac") and run that same code block mentioned by
   Pedro, you will see 0 (zero) groups returned.<br>
   Essentially at this point - unless you have created custom groups -
   this method is non functional.</p></div></li>

   <div><p>Also - not sure if this needs to be an additional ticket or not
   ..</p>
   <p>Because of this inability to "getAllGroups" and then get the
   contacts per system-managed group combined with the inability to
   identify what group a contact belongs when reviewing contact
   details from getAllPeople() - you get a list of contacts that is
   far too large and has multiple of the same contact with no way to
   determine which is from which group.</p>
   <p>When I run getAllPeople() I get a list of nearly 4000 contacts
   that has many duplicate and triplicates in there because they come
   from multiple system-managed groups that I cannot detect to filter
   out.</p></div></li>

   Can I get an update on the status of the defect here? Unless I can filter or search based on group so I don't get replicated contacts, I cannot continue with the app in Titanium.</li>
<li>John V Pataki 2011-05-03

   This problem prohibits the ability to get a list of contacts without getting replicated contacts in the list - is there a fix planned or a workaround?</li>
<li>Stephen Tramer 2011-06-24

   Apple bug. We can't work around it; it occurs at the API level.
