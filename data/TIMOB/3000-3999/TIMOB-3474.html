<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>I have a table view with a form and on submit it brings the user
to a webview that shows results. That works great. But when the
user goes BACK to the form. It appears for a second and then
crashes with the following result. This was working great in
versions prior to 1.6 but since 1.6 its been crashing.<br>
<code><br>
2011-03-18 22:04:56.252 APPNAME [58306:7003] bool
_WebTryThreadLock(bool),<br>
0x6c64cc0: Tried to obtain the web lock from a thread other than
the main thread or the web<br>
thread. This may be a result of calling to UIKit from a secondary
thread. Crashing now...<br></code></p>
<p>Note that this bug only happens when on click I was creating
window object and then use an JS file for the url parameter and
opening the window. When that window opens the JS file, that file
used the current window and built the webview.</p>
<p>That used to work fine but now when I go BACK from that webview
to the prev screen I'd get the _webtrythreadlock error.</p>
<p>So what I did was remove the JS file and simply create the
webview on the click event instead. I like to keep things clean and
use JS files to keep things organized but In this case its causing
the crash it seems.</p>
<p>This is happening in v1.6 and v1.7. I hope I'm correct and this
helps. Thanks</p></div>
