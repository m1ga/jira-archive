					"body": "Not contesting this would be a cute feature request, but I do have to point out a few things:\n\nThe property name is confusing. There is no 'register' per se, one registers with the servers, but that happens regardless of the notification being fired while the application was in the foreground or background. Perhaps a better name for the property might be 'inBackground'.\n\nAlso, note that the different native codepaths depend on if the app was resident in memory. In other words, if the app is backgrounded and then relaunched, the logic suggested would falsely report the application was not in the background due to it not having been unloaded from memory.\n\nFinally, the reason for the request worries me. Applications should not show dialog boxes due to push or local notifications, they should only silently update what's needed. There is a reason that push notifications went from feature to throttled feature to throttled feature that can be disabled.\n\nThe author of the ticket should reconsider his UI regarding notifications, regardless of when this issue is resolved.",
