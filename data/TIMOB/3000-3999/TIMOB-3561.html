<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>Bad news! iOS does not forward exceptions properly to the JSCore
system, meaning that unhandled exceptions result in crashes. What
we need to do is catch exceptions from Kroll invokes (and
potentially on other threads via the uncaught exception handler...)
and forward them to the JSCore system so that they can be caught on
the user side (although if they're uncaught, we need to figure out
what to do about that, and how JS responds.)</p></div>

Could be handed off.

   Turns out that this is a well-known bug with iOS 4.0+ simulator:

   This bug does NOT affect devices.  What we need to do is:
   
   1. File a bug with Apple (even if it's a dupe)
   2. Mark this ticket as dependent upon this bugfix
   3. Replace any portion of the code that SHOULD be throwing exceptions but is currently logging with the right logic (exceptions)</li>

   Blain provided an internal fix for this at some point; No longer reproducible in 1.8.0.1.ab0c003. Ticket can be resolved once drillbit is performing exception checks again.</li>
