   QA needs to validate as we can't currently test push notifications.</li>
<li>Rick Blalock 2011-04-15

   Just so we're clear:  The issue happens for all apps now because we include the push apis in all binaries.  The bug doesn't relate to push functionality per se, just the fact that Apple is enforcing their policy that if it exists in the binary and isn't being used, the app will be rejected (which in our case is every app now).
   
   Edit:  Ok I see.  Sorry Reggie.  For some reason the commit didn't come through here so wasn't sure what your comment meant.  I see the commit in GH.  Thanks!</li>
