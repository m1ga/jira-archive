<h3>Description</h3>

<div><p>I'm finding that in any of the tableviews in my application, if
I hit two rows very quickly and get both to highlight, the app will
freeze completely. I put a message on a short timer, and this stops
getting spewed out into my console in Xcode. I can't isolate what's
causing this in my code, however, but it would appear it's a bug in
Appcelerator.</p>
<p>I'm using version 1.6.1, and only seeing this bug on physical
devices (happens on both iPad and iPhone 4). I can't reproduce it
at all on the simulator, which makes debugging it very
difficult.</p>
<p>Obviously I don't want to post my application source here, but I
can privately give you a copy of my code so you can see what's
happening and hopefully fix it.</p></div>
