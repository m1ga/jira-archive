   Just realized the code snippet above is using the deprecated 'url' prop. instead of 'image' prop.  Issue stil remains however.</li>

   Okay is this fixed in the latest 1.7 release? If not will I be notified when it's part of the release? Also can you possibly give me a rough idea when 1.7 might be released? I'm massively stuck behind this bug. I've 7 Apps on hold in the Market. I don't get paid until they're formally released! Thanks. </li>

   I may be being a tad on the thick side here but I am confused as to what the latest update to this ticket means? What is 'Sprint 2011-18'? Is this a new release? An impending release? Is this a release I can get my hands on? At the moment all I need is some visibility as to when this might be fixed? As I mentioned previously. I have 7 Apps on hold in the Android Market behind this bug! Thanks.</li>

   Hey Ivan.. I'm currently tackling this bug. The different "Sprints" are just the way we divvy up the tickets into weeks. (This fix should make it into the 1.7.0 release)</li>

   Marshall, thanks. I am assuming that this will make it into a continuous build? I am keen to get this tested and running so that I can deploy and hoping that will be with a cont. build as I don't think I'll be able to wait until the final release of 1.7 (when is that estimated to be by the way?).
   
   Thanks, mad desperate, panicky me!</li>

   This was a doozy -- I ran into an Android bug that's best described in two places:
   
   <a href="http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=6066" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=6066</a>

   Unfortunately none of the workarounds seem to fit our situation, and Skia won't reliably decode certain JPEGs no matter how we feed the decoder (Stream, Byte array, File, etc.) The workaround I've pushed automatically retries every 250ms up to 5 times (and can be controlled by an Android-only property "decodeRetries")</li>
