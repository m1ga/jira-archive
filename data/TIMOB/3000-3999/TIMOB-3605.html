<h3>Description</h3>

In FastDev mode, we don't recompile the project to detect which modules are (or aren't) used. The initial build of a Fastdev app should enable all modules, so there aren't any weird consequences of using undetected modules in fast turnaround.

   I have added sub-types of Release type in Task Type field. Can you pick specific sub-type to unbind 'Release' type, please ?.</li>

   Re-opening to look more closely at problem when building first on emulator then immediately releasing to device.</li>

   Test my changes merged with Marshall's recent big fastdev-related changes.  tested several scenarios and realized part of my code from previous commit wasn't necessary.  Ripped it out and retested several scenarios. </li>
