   I have come up with the same results but the application doesn't appear in the emulator. I restarted Appcelerator and tried rebooting my computer. That didn't help.
   
   EvoD
   
   BUT NOW. . . after shutting down and restarting and creating a new app it loads adn opens without the error. Stupid, reminds me of the IT Crowd, "Have you turned it off and turned it on again?" Good Luck!</li>

   This looks to me like a platform SDK thing. We just call out to their scripts to do the packaging, and this is their output...</li>

   Ralf: I'm not sure I moved this issue over to the correct spot or not. We got this report from QA on Titanium Studio, and it looks to me like an intermittent, possibly benign issue with the Android packaging scripts/process.</li>

   Unable to reproduce this issue with a Samsung Galaxy S3, TiSDK 2.2.0v20120810194112, TiStudio 2.1.1.201207271312.</li>
