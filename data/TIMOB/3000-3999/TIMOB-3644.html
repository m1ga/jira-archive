   only seen on galaxy tab and no on droid 1 or nexus s</li>

   Tried on the Galaxy Tab Emulator.  I can't run KS on the Galaxy Tab emulator because they don't include Google APIs, but I ripped out the alert dialogs test (alert.js) and put its code into its own heavyweight window in a test app, and the dialogs worked fine.  But this doesn't necessarily mean anything. :)
   
   Marshall, as you have the Tab, I'm gonna hand off to you.  Start by installing KS and running Base UI > Views > Alert Dialog and try all the buttons.  If they work, we'll need more info.</li>

   Assigning to MC because he has Tab.  See my comment, Marshall.</li>

   There are a number of tests affected by this bug in KitchenSink/SmokeTest:
   
   - Base UI > Views > Alert Dialog
   - Controls > Activity Indicator
   - Controls > Progress Dialog
   - Phone > Play Movie
   
   I also attached a standalone test that shows the fail case in 5 different situations</li>
<li>Eric Merriman  2011-05-18

   I tried the standalone test and the app stopped on the splash on emulator and Galaxy Tab. Tried in iOS simulator for comparison and got "result of expression 'Titanium.UI.ActivityIndicator' [undefined] is not an object. at app.js (line 31)" I added the following code to the test: 
   var win = Titanium.UI.createWindow({  
       backgroundColor:'#fff'
   });
   
   line 31 is the second line of this:
   var progressIndicator = Titanium.UI.createActivityIndicator({
   31-->	location: Titanium.UI.ActivityIndicator.DIALOG,
   	type: Titanium.UI.ActivityIndicator.DETERMINANT,
   	message: 'Downloading 0 of 10',
   	min: 0,
   	max: 10,
   	value: 0
   });</li>

   Verified fixed in KS on the Galaxy Tab (2.2.1), Titanium Studio, build: 1.0.0.201105131803, Titanium SDK version: 1.7.X (r187fe3fd). </li>
