   Works great.  I tested a few ways.  First I set the value very low (1, which is 1K), then used <code>adb shell</code> to watch if anything was put in the cache folder during Kitchen Sink remote images test.  The remote image used in that test is 8K.  As hoped, the image was not even put into the cache.
   
   Next, I set it to 10 (10K), then ran KS again and the remote image view test.  The 8K file appeared in the cache folder.  Then I went to "Mashups - Twitter" in KS.  It pulled down the appcelerator twitter profile image which is about 3K and put it in the cache, so that means it went over the 10K limit.  I waited for a while, and sure enough the 8K file disappeared after a while (the cache cleanup occurred.)
   
   Awesome.
