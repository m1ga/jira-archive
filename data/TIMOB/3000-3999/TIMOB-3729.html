   Seems to always notice updated or totally new JS files, which is awesome.  However, I copied a png file into Resources and -- in JS -- created an ImageView to load that png, and that didn't work (empty view) via fastdev -- this might be okay, maybe it's only supposed to serve up JS files.  But then I went back to TiStudio and restarted the app from there, and it still didn't work.  I could see that it did a "quick" restart (the optimized builder Marshall did).  But that graphic still didn't work.
   
   To get it to work, I had to touch tiapp.xml and re-launch from TiStudio; then it did the "big" builder.py run and everything worked.</li>

   Added and resolved a bug for this here: TIMOB-3838</li>

   Tested a variety of "maybe breakable" scenarios, such as:
   
   * Close the emulator while fastdev enabled and running, then re-launch from TiStudio
   * Close TiStudio while fastdev enabled and running (and emulator running), then reopen TiStudio.
   * Close both emulator and TiStudio and reopen TiStudio and relaunch.
   * Force Stop the fastdev'd application on the emulator, then re-open it.
   
   All worked well.
   
   Also installed TiStudio in Ubuntu 10.10 and Windows XP VMs and ran fastdev tests -- worked well.
   
   I did see some weird issues where fastdev stopped working (maybe after several hours of idle?) and was unrecoverable.  I created separate items for them TIMOB-3864 and TIMOB-3865.  But I'll close the original fastdev item as fixed, having tested its basic functionality and having made separate items for the issues.</li>
