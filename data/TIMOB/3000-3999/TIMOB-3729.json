However, I copied a png file into Resources and -- in JS -- created an ImageView to load that png, and that didn't work (empty view) via fastdev -- this might be okay, maybe it's only supposed to serve up JS files.  But then I went back to TiStudio and restarted the app from there, and it still didn't work.  I could see that it did a \"quick\" restart (the optimized builder Marshall did).  But that graphic still didn't work.\n\nTo get it to work, I had to touch tiapp.xml and re-launch from TiStudio; then it did the \"big\" builder.py run and everything worked.",

I created separate items for them TIMOB-3864 and TIMOB-3865.  But I'll close the original fastdev item as fixed, having tested its basic functionality and having made separate items for the issues.",
