   Already has a very comprehensive Drillbit test which does what I would have done had I written a test app.  I examined the drillbit code to be sure it's really covering the new stuff, then I ran the drillbit and checked the log to be sure those tests ran.  Everything peachy.
   
   I also committed a documentation change that I made after noticing some orphaned "- method : " sections.</li>
