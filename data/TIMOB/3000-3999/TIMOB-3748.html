<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>The Problem</h4>
setInterval leaks objects (and memory) on iOS. Even without anything in it, this can still be observed.

<h4>Sample Code</h4>
If you are feeling particularly adventurous, lower the period of the below code to 1 instead of 30. It will increase the rate of the leak and slow your computer down a bit, but the same behavior can be observed at higher periods such as 30 or 200. I did not test on anything longer than 200.

<code><pre>
function checkInterval() { }
setInterval(checkInterval, 30);
</pre></code>

I ran the above code alone in an app.js using XCode's "Profile" > "Allocations" feature. It leaks at a rate of approximately 100 CFStrings, 100 CFDates, and 30ish KrollInvocations per second.

<h4>Associated Helpdesk Ticket</h4>
There isn't one. I noticed this in one of our co-dev apps.

   Timers, when running, keep the meter running on autorelease pools. This adds a new autorelease pool to stop that.</li>

   Verified fixed with SDK build r364c307e. Verified leak prior to verifying fix. With fix memory allocation stayed stable on iOS 4.3.3 with iPhone 4. Closing.</li>
