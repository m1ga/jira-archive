   Potentially fixed by 70055c0. Unable to replicate in testing because it relies on timing your suspend/resume EXACTLY at the same moment as analytics is writing to the database to queue an event.
   
   Going to discuss with Blain this week and potentially close the bug then.</li>
<li>Stephen Tramer 2011-05-03

   "Resolved" by commit 821cd06 (no longer able to reproduce).  Issue may reappear again, as it has done a handful of times in the past, but hopefully this resolves it for good.</li>

   Tested with a Verizon iPhone 4, opened/closed KS over 30 times without an issue. Placing a stamp of approval on this one.</li>
