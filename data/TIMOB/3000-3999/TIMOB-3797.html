<h3>Description</h3>

This is a feature request to be able to add a list of files to be ignored on build time.

Let me quote the helpdesk ticket asking for this:

There are certain files that exist in my project that I would like to always ignore when building the application. Occasionally I will use winmerge and it will generate a backup file or occasionally temp files remain in my resources folder. 

Because of this I have to go through and clean the folder of files I don't want included when the application is built. It would be nice if within the tiapp.xml file there could be a section like:

<code><pre>
&lt;ignore-files&gt;tmp, bak, zip, txt&lt;/ignore-files&gt;
</pre></code>

   The proposed method of listing files to ignore is not flexible and not XML-like. This would be better:
   
   <code><pre>
   &lt;ignore-files&gt;
       &lt;file&gt;*.tmp&lt;/file&gt;
       &lt;file&gt;dist/*&lt;/file&gt;
       &lt;match&gt;\.zip$&lt;/match&gt;
   &lt;/ignore-files&gt;
   </pre></code>
   
   Each file should be a separate XML entity. Furthermore, I think there should be two ways of doing this: the standard wildcard syntax (file) and regular expressions (match).</li>

   This is sorely needed. I just added a mercurial/hg sub repository to my project, which adds a .hg folder into resources, so now Android won't build:
   
   [ERROR] /Users/justin/Documents/WorkPlan/Resources/lib/common/.hg/store/data/_common_modules.js.i is an invalid filename. Android will not package assets whose filenames start with underscores. Fix and rebuild.
   [ERROR] :  Build process exited with code 1
   [ERROR] :  Project failed to build after 467ms</li>

   This would be extremely useful, especially for those that use 3rd party javascript components that are only used in the development environments..</li>

   [~fmiao] i have a user requesting this feature, would they be able to use these options now? </li>

   [~vvazquezmontero], <code>cli.ignoreDirs</code> and <code>cli.ignoreFiles</code> configuration option are available through <code>appc ti config</code>. </li>
