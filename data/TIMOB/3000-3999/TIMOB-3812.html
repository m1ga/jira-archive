<h3>Description</h3>

This is useful for developers who grab CI builds, or use Git and "scons" to try more recent SDKs.

For example, instead of downloading many 1.7.0 SDKs, many of us differentiate by renaming the SDK dir to  to 1.7.0.0428 or something.

This will work is the rename is the first thing done.

Problem:

If Ti MObile projects are built, the python scripts are compiled and retain the SDK path. Some other side effects don't allow you to rename after building your 1st project. So maybe one solution would be an "SDK -clean" concept.
