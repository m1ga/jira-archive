<h3>Description</h3>

if you attempt to use the 'titanium run' from console, you get the following error from python script:


Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/Library/Application Support/Titanium/mobilesdk/osx/1.7.0/module/builder.py", line 106, in stage
run_python(create_project_args)
File "/Library/Application Support/Titanium/mobilesdk/osx/1.7.0/module/builder.py", line 33, in run_python
return run(args, cwd=cwd)
File "/Library/Application Support/Titanium/mobilesdk/osx/1.7.0/module/builder.py", line 36, in run
proc = run_pipe(args, cwd)
File "/Library/Application Support/Titanium/mobilesdk/osx/1.7.0/module/builder.py", line 19, in run_pipe
return subprocess.Popen(args, stderr=subprocess.STDOUT, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, cwd=cwd)
File "/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/lib/python2.6/subprocess.py", line 595, in __init__

Looks like someone refactored the module builder code and broke this.

   To test this fix, simply go into the root of a project in the console.
   
   Type 'titanium run'
   
   This assumes you are running the titanium.py script (which is located in the root of the mobilesdk directory under /Library/Application Support/Titanium/mobilesdk/[VERSION]).
   
   I usually just alias this file to the current release.</li>

   Haven't been able to reproduce this yet. I assume this is a module project you're trying to run -- Some follow-up questions:
   
   - Is it an iOS or Android module project?
   - Do you know what version of the MobileSDK the project was created with?
   - Can you also pastie the project's manifest file?</li>

   ios
   it was 1.7 as of head when i created it
   it was a generic project (nothing special, just created new).

   Tested with 1.7.0.631e153 running 'titanium run' you get required argument '--platform' missing which is the expected error message
