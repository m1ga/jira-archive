<h3>Description</h3>

1. Phone > orientation in landscape
2. note how it loads 
results: loads in portrait orientation

3.rotate 90 degrees
results: nothing

4.rotate 90 degrees
results: app rotates to landscape and reports itself as such (device is being held in upside down portrait)

expected: app to report back device orientation, and to reflect orientation the device is being held in.

It seems the android tablets (including the galaxy) support more than the usual 2 orientation modes on android phones.

   Closing, new behavior is: Steps 1-2: Xoom loads in landscape, KS reports as such. Step 3: rotating either way works as expected with "portrait" reported. Step 4: device rotates as expected and reports as expected. Verified with SDKs 1.7.2 r3d44999e and 1.8.0 r4b694252.</li>
