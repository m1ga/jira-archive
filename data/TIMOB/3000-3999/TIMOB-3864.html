<h3>Description</h3>

My emulator is refusing the connection (for whatever reason -- see below).  When that happens, the builder.py process continues on as though fastdev is enabled and doesn't do a "full" rebuild but rather continues with the "fast", highly optimized launch that Marshall instituted.  The only way at that point to get updated code to the emulator would be to touch tiapp.xml, which we should try to avoid telling users to do.

(Regarding the connection being refused: don't know why, so not sure what to put in a new ticket regarding that.  It was working, but then later wasn't.  Does the server shutdown at a certain point?  I left it running and unused for several hours (probably at least 5 hours), then when I started using it again it refused connection.)

   Later, I remembered about that hidden lock file.  It seemed to start working again after I deleted that.  (Though by that time several hours had passed and I'd opened and closed emulators a few times, so it's hard to be sure.)</li>
