<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>New Feature</h4>
Add the option to customize the location of core images on both Android and iOS. By "core images", I mean app icons, launch images, and (on iOS), the iTunesArtwork.

<h4>Ideal Behavior</h4>
The tooling could look in the tiapp.xml to see if the paths have been customized. It could then adjust the generated project files' paths to the images, or copy the core images to where it wants them in the generated project.

<h4>Sample tiapp.xml</h4>
This is my idea for how it could work.
<code><pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;ti:app xmlns:ti="<a href="http://ti.appcelerator.org" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://ti.appcelerator.org</a>"&gt;
    &lt;id&gt;com.dawson.coreimagessample&lt;/id&gt;
    &lt;name&gt;CoreImagesSample&lt;/name&gt;
    ... etc ...
    &lt;app-icons&gt;
        &lt;image device="iphone"&gt;images/iphone/appicon.png&lt;/image&gt;
        &lt;image device="iphone-retina"&gt;images/iphone/appicon@2x.png&lt;/image&gt;
        &lt;image device="ipad"&gt;images/ipad/appicon@ipad.png&lt;/image&gt;
        &lt;image device="android" density="low"&gt;images/android/appicon.png&lt;/image&gt;
        &lt;image device="android" density="medium"&gt;images/android/appicon@medium.png&lt;/image&gt;
        &lt;image device="android" density="high"&gt;images/android/appicon@high.png&lt;/image&gt;
    &lt;/app-icons&gt;
    &lt;launch-images&gt;
        &lt;image device="iphone" orientation="landscape"&gt;images/iphone/appicon.png&lt;/image&gt;
        &lt;image device="iphone" orientation="portrait"&gt;images/iphone/appicon.png&lt;/image&gt;
        ... etc ...
    &lt;/launch-images&gt;
    &lt;iTunesArtwork&gt;images/iphone/iTunesArtwork&lt;/iTunesArtwork&gt;
&lt;/ti:app&gt;
</pre></code>

<h4>Why</h4>
One of our enterprise customers wants to be able to have a single folder that their designers can access. Right now, they have to have certain images in the top Resources folder, which is undesirable for their use case. They don't want designers to have access to the programming, but don't have a choice with how the tooling works right now.

   I will test if the /platform folder can be used on both iOS and Android for maintaining a single folder (relatively) with all image resources separate from the code base, and then I will repurpose this ticket for any necessary changes.

   To large for 1.8.0.</li>

   Bumped to "Next Release". I have experimented on iOS with placing images on the platform/ios folder, but I haven't been able to use these or figure out where they are in the resulting generated project. I'll investigate further in the near future.</li>
<li>Dawson Toth 2011-11-03

   I just verified that the contents of platform/iphone are NOT copied in to the resulting app. The tooling needs to be updated to copy the contents of this folder in to the app, like it does on Android.
   
   <h4>How To Test</h4>
   
   1. Create an app or use an existing one; the JavaScript doesn't matter.
   2. Create the "platform/iphone" folder. "platform" should be side by side with your "Resources" directory, and not inside of it.
   3. Create an image or a file in the "platform/iphone" folder.
   4. Build your project.
   5. Show the package contents of build/iphone/build/Debug-iphonesimulator/your.app.
   6. Locate your image that you placed in "platform/iphone".</li>

   This is a pretty old ticket. The linked ticket could possibly resolve the original use-case behind this ticket.</li>
