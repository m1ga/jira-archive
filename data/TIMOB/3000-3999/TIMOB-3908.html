<h3>Description</h3>

The Titanium Studio is installing the RIM plugin as an eclipse plugin. However, it looks like the lookup for the JavaLoader executable is wrong in this case.
The path that is constructed for the lookup is something like C:\eclipse\plugins\net.rim.ejde\vmTools\JavaLoader.exe, while the path on the plugged-in RIM plugin is something like C:\eclipse\plugins\net.rim.ejde.componentpack5.0.0_5.0.0.25\components\bin\JavaLoader.exe.

The path should probably be located by a look-up into the net.rim.ejde structure. If it's not there, like in the plug-in version, locate it at the latest version of the installed componentpack, probably under components\bin.  

At the moment, this issue blocks TISTUD-323 from working well without a workaround of creating a plugins\net.rim.ejde\vmTools\ directory structure and manually copy the files into it.
