<h3>Description</h3>

Description: 
While testing KitchenSink, Base UI>Views>Dashboard view, clicking a dashboard icon (other than the first two icons) a window opens with a close button. When you click the close button, the button is moved to the upper left hand corner of the window and animates with the window as it closes.

Steps to reproduce:
1) Install KitchenSink 1.7.0 on an iPhone or other device
2) Launch Base UI>Views>Dashboard
3) Click an icon other than the first two to open the new window
4) Click the close button

Result:
The close button moves to the upper left-hand of the window and stays as the animation progresses

Expected Result:
The close button is removed, then the window animates as it closes

   This item will be affected by the new Layout Manager changes and should be addressed afterward.</li>

   This should be resolved by some of the new layout changes.</li>
<li>Blain Hamon 2011-11-15

   These are both cases where layout borks during animations. I'm tempted to mark them as dupes of each other.</li>
<li>Blain Hamon 2012-03-06

   This still happens in composite layout. Leaving open.</li>

   Closing ticket as invalid as this version of Kitchen Sink is no longer in use.</li>
