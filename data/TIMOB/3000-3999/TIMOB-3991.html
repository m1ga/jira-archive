   This is a side effect of 1.7 moving to file urls instead of naked paths to have parity with Android.</li>

   Verified fixed. (1_7_X, e6afca8..., Verizon iPhone 4.2.7)</li>

   This bug is still occurring with Verizon iPhone 4 (4.2.6) and SDK version: 1.7.X r3ecace11. Console output:
   
   Fri May 20 11:20:50 unknown KitchenSink[68523] <Warning>: MP _playbackInterruptionDidEndNotification :: NSConcreteNotification 0x6846b10 {name = AVController_PlaybackInterruptionDidEndNotification; object = <AVController: 0x6821b00>; userInfo = {
   	    "AVController_InterruptionStatusNotificationParameter" = "non-resumable.PlayAndRecord";
   	    "AVController_InterruptorNameNotificationParameter" = RecorderServer;
   	}}, _state = 0
   
   In addition, there is another test: Phone>record Video which will not play back the video after:
   1) Tap "record movie"
   2) Tap recording button
   3) Tap recording again to stop
   4) Tap "use"
   5) Tap "play movie"
   
   I would be happy to open another bug for this if desired.</li>

   Turns out it was fixed in master, but wasn't cherry-picked to 1.7</li>
<li>Eric Merriman  2011-05-23

   Verified fixed in both paths on Verizon iPhone 4 (4.2.6) , Titanium Studio, build: 1.0.0.201105131803, Titanium SDK version: 1.7.X r86dae2c9. Closing.</li>
