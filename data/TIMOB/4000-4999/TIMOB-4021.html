<h3>Description</h3>

Description:
While testing KS, Base UI>Views>Web Views>Local URL, the instructions call for clicking on the text "Click Me to Hide the Toolbar". When this is done, the webView shifts to the left. It seems like it is trying to center itself.

Steps to Reproduce:
1) Install KS 1.7.0 on a Nexus S
2) Navigate to Base UI>Views>Web Views>Local URL and launch test
3) Follow instructions and click on text: "Click Me to Hide the Toolbar"

Result:
View shifts to the left

Expected Result:
No view shift

Notes:
Does not occur on 1.6.2

   I walked through this with Opie a couple days ago. We are following the expected behavior for Android. If you double-tap in the top left of the window it will zoom as expected. Basically, like the browser, it it zoom relative to the click. In this case it's middle horizontal because you're most likely clicking in the center of the screen.
   
   If you see this behavior, please close this as invalid.</li>
