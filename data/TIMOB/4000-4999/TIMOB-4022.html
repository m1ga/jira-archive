<h3>Description</h3>

Description:
While testing KS, Base UI>Views>Web Views>Local URL, the view can be zoomed in and out using controls that appear when the view is manipulated. It seems that the controls are being interfered with by the box with the text: "Click above to hide me". They usually don't function, but it's possible to get some activity when clicking on certain parts of the control. When this box is not present, then controls function as expected.

Steps to Reproduce:
1) Install KS 1.7.0 on a Nexus S
2) Navigate to Base UI>Views>Web Views>Local URL and launch test
3) Touch and drag on view to bring up Zoom controls
4) Attempt to use zoom controls

Result:
Zoom controls do not function or function partially

Expected Result:
Zoom controls function as intended

Notes:
Does not occur on 1.6.2
