<h3>Description</h3>

Description:
While testing KS, Phone>Sound>Local, the sound volume increased as I moved from .1 through .3. .4 - 1.0 sounded the same level as .3. This occurred with all the sound tests using the cricket sound: Phone>Sound>Local, Phone>Sound>Local with file, and Phone>Sound>Local with file URL. This did not occur on the eris. It is best heard through headphones also this is not a requirement.

Steps to Reproduce:
1) Install KS 1.7.0 on a Nexus S
2) Navigate to Phone>Sound>Local and launch test
3) change volume from .3 to .4 and above

Result:
No volume change

Expected Result:
Smooth gain increase throughout the range

Notes:
