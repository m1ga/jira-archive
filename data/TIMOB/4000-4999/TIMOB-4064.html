   To test:
   
   * Launch any app from Titanium Studio to the Android emulator.  Take note of which emulator is launched (titanium_X_XXXX).
   * Close the emulator after the application launches (you can keep Ti Studio open.)
   * Run the Android SDK and AVD Manager, i.e., by running <code>android</code> at a command-line (it's in the <code>tools</code> sub-folder of the Android SDK folder.)
   * In the SDK and AVD MAnager, select "Virtual Devices", then find the emulator that you just ran your app in, select it and click "Delete...".  Go ahead and confirm.
   * Back in Ti Studio, launch your app again.  This will force the AVD that you just deleted to be re-created.
   * As the emulator is launching, you can check your home folder's <code>.titanium</code> sub-folder, which is where we store emulator SDCard images.  You should see a titanium-xx-xxxxx.sdcard file there that just got created.</li>
