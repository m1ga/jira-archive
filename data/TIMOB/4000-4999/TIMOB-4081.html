<h3>Description</h3>

Description:
While testing KS 1.7.0, BaseUI>Views>scrollViews>Scrollable View, the test calls for the user to click on the view label and to refer to the console for output. No INFO is sent to the console for "touchEnd" or "click".

Steps to reproduce:
1) Install KS 1.7.0
2) Launch DDMS or logcat
3) Navigate to BaseUI>Views>scrollViews>Scrollable View
4) Tap the label (or simply the view) 

Result:
Nothing output to console

Expected result:
Ti.API.info('ScrollView received click event, source = ' + e.source);

Notes:
Scroll event listener is outputting to console as expected.
Also occurs with 1.6.2
