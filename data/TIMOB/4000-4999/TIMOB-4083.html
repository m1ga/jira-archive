<h3>Description</h3>

Description:
While testing KS 1.7.0, Controls>Switch , I used the d-pad on the droid to select the button "Change Switch". The button flashed, but the switch did not change state. Tapping this button changed the state as expected.

Steps to reproduce:
1) Install KS 1.7.0
2) Navigate to Controls>Switch 
3) Use the droid d-pad to move to the button "change Switch" and click the center of the d-pad to select

Result:
The button flashes but the switch state remains unchanged

Expected result:
The switch changed state and the button indicates it was pressed

Notes:
Also occurs with 1.6.2

   Verified this also occurs on the Nexus One. Click on switch works, clicking on the button "fails". If you use the button test on the custom button, you can see that it also jumps through too many states on each click. We're probably sending multiple click events on d-pad select.
   
   This should be fixed for 1.7.0, post RC.</li>
