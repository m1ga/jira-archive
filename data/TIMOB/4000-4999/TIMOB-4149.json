I was then able to type in the field despite it supposedly being (and looking ) disabled. This could be caused by focus not really being removed from the field during testing.\n\nAlso, it seems on the droid that it takes two taps on the \"enabled\" button to actually toggle the status\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1) install KS 1.7.0 on Droid 1\n2) Navigate to: Controls>text field>The rest\n3) Tap the text field to bring up soft Keyboard\n4) Type something then hit \"done\" to dismiss keyboard\n5) Tap \"Enabled\" to toggle disabling the field. (may require two taps)\n6) focus on the text field again by tapping to bring up the soft KB\n7) Type something\n\nResult:\nText appears in field\n\nExpected Result:\nNo text appears in field, and focus can't be gained for field\n\nNotes:\nOccurs with 1.6.2 on Droid",
