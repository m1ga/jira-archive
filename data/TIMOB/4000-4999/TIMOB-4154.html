<h3>Description</h3>

Description:
While testing KitchenSink Phone>Sound>Remote streaming, I clicked "start streaming" before remembering that this particular link has already been reported broken. I then pressed "back" and realizing this was the last test in the category, pressed "back" again. The device crashed (see log attached).

Steps to reproduce:
1) Install KS 1.7.0 on Droid
2) Navigate to Phone>Sound>Remote streaming
3) Press "start streaming"
4) Give up, and press "back" on device
5) Press "back" once more


Result:
crash

Expected Result:
continuing on with testing

Notes:
Occurs on 1.6.2 as well.
Does not occur on Nexus S

   There isn't enough in the log to really help. No stack trace. Could you attach the entire log leading up to this problem? Does it occur on any other slow devices you have in house?</li>
