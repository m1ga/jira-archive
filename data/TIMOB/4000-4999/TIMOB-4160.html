<h3>Description</h3>

Description:
KS does not throw an alert when it goes to the background. Console output from KS being placed in background to launching again is:
Fri May 20 11:56:32 unknown UIKitApplication:com.appcelerator.pushtest[0x10c3][68700] <Notice>: [INFO] app was paused from the foreground
Fri May 20 11:56:32 unknown KitchenSink[68700] <Warning>: [Warning] Deregistering for sleep notifications when we have not registered
Fri May 20 11:56:32 unknown com.apple.launchd[1] <Error>: (com.apple.mobile.installd.mount_helper) posix_spawn("/usr/libexec/installd_mount_helper", ...): No such file or directory

Fri May 20 11:56:38 unknown KitchenSink[68700] <Warning>: [Warning] IMLocalObject died: [IMLocalObject] Port Name: com.appcelerator.pushtest-listener

Steps to reproduce:
1) Install and launch KS
2) Click the "home" button to background KS

Result:
No alert is presented

Expected Result:
Alert with "close" or "Resume" and very excited text describing the fact that KS is now in the background

   This may be considered intermittent as I have just witnessed the alert for the first time this pass. I'll try to provide more data around frequency.</li>
<li>Blain Hamon 2011-05-20

   Turns out it's as designed: On the first launch, the notification happens, but the JS specifically asks to stop the background service once it's done. Tested this on 1.6.2 and had same behavior.</li>
