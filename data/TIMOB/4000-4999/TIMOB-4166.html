<h3>Description</h3>

Quick question for the iOS team...

An enterprise customer sent in pull request 85 on Titanium Mobile a while ago
<a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/85" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/85</a>

This makes it so the "scroll" event of a table view fires after the user has stopped dragging the table.

But taking this as is would break existing code -- the event would fire more than anticipated, and it would operate inconsistently with Android (right now, they work the same).

So... my idea is we add a flag to let the user trigger this behavior. Something like "fireScrollOnlyWhenDragging". This defaults to false, but can be set to true on a particular table view.

That would let us...

<code><pre>
if (scrollView.isDragging || !fireScrollOnlyWhenDragging) { ... }
</pre></code>

Resulting in a happy client and a consistent cross platform experience.

Thoughts?

   Going to reject the pull request (messy, breaks parity with Android, etc.) and reschedule for 1.8.0 as per RLS.</li>
<li>Stephen Tramer 2011-07-14

   Changed fix-version after merge to 1_7_X</li>

   Whoops, wrong ticket</li>

   Test app.
   
   BEHAVIOR BEFORE FIX:
   
   - Scroll events are not fired any more as soon as finger is lifted and dragging ends
   
   BEHAVIOR AFTER FIX:
   
   - Scroll events are fired as long as the tableview content is scrolling, including AFTER dragging ends</li>
