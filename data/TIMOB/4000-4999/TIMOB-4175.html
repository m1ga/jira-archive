<h3>Description</h3>

Description:
When exercising various KS tests, orientation changes remove selections, delete buttons, and remove focus from text fields (and dismiss the KB if it's shown). Here are a list of the offending test cases:
Base UI>Views>Table Views>Table View w/Text Field : Loses text field focus and dismisses keyboard (occurs on 1.6.2)
Base UI>Views>Table Views>Delete Mode : If you select edit, then the minus to bring up delete button, delete button is gone after rotation (occurs on 1.6.2)
Base UI>Animation>transitions (Occurs on 1.6.2) : Choose full view, then rotate to landscape, view is dismissed


Steps to reproduce:
1) Install KS 1.7.0 on iPad 1
2) Navigate to Base UI>Views>Table Views>Table View w/Text Field
	Tap on text field to give focus and invoke keyboard
OR
2) Navigate to Base UI>Views>Table Views>Delete Mode
	Select edit then select minus to bring up delete button
OR
2) Navigate to Base UI>Animation>transitions
	Choose full view
	
4) Rotate device

Result:
Path 1: KB dismissed, text field loses focus
Path 2: Delete button removed
Path 3: View is disposed

Expected Result:
Textfield focus remains, KB still active.
Delete button remains
View remains
