<h3>Description</h3>

Description:
I am running a test pass for Studio emulator launching. Both Studio and Developer have an issue (potentially with build scripts) with using the 1.7.X SDK and trying to launch the iPad simulator. The selection of the SDK doesn't seem to take effect until the second launch of the simulator, and then trails behind your current selection by one. For example: Selecting a project and trying to run 4.3 iPad simulator gets you an unknown iOS simulation. Then selecting 3.2 and launching will get you 4.3 (your last setting). Running again with 4.2 selected will get you 3.2 and so on.

Steps to reproduce:
1) Create an iPad targeted project with Studio or developer (TI SDK 1.7.X).
2) Choose an SDK and launch iPad simulator
3) Select a different SDK and launch the simulator again

Result:
Your simulation SDK trails behind your selection by one iteration

Expected Result:
The currently selected SDK is simulated

Notes:
Does not occur on 1.6.2
