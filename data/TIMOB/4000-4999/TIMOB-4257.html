<h3>Description</h3>

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Login to studio as a licensed user
2. Create a new project
3. Logout and login as an unlicensed user
4. Add modules to the project created in step 2
5. Compile project and run

Actual Result:
An unlicensed user can just take a project from a licensed user and use all the modules

Should not allow user to share licensed projects

   This allows one licensed user to create 100+ projects to give to all other unlicensed user</li>

   Bug still persists on:
   
   SDK build: 2.0.1.v20120410103239
   Titanium Studio, build: 2.0.1.201204101854
   xcode: 4.3
   Device: iPad 3 4G (5.1)</li>

   Not exactly sure how things work today, but modules are tied to a user, an org associated to the user, or an app associated to the user. If the user changes, the app is still tied to the org, so this may not be a bug, but rather a bad design. If we ever switch to entitlements and signed modules, that should fix the problem and usher in a wave of new tickets.</li>
