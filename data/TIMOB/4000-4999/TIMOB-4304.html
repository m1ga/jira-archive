<h3>Description</h3>

Description: 
While testing KitchenSink,Base UI>Nav Group, I noticed that the iPad has a red background to the modal window, while the other devices were grey. Turns out the iPad was the only correct one of the 4 devices in test. A check of the code  (navgroup.js) shows:
var modalWin = Ti.UI.createWindow({
	backgroundColor:"red"
});

Steps to reproduce: 
1) Install KS onto device 
2) Navigate to Base UI>Nav Group
3) Examine the background

Result: 
Color is grey

Expected Result:
Color is red

Notes:
OCCURS in 1.6.2
Blain mentions that this seems to be due to a clear versus colored background for the grouped table view.
