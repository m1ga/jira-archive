<h3>Description</h3>

Description:
While testing KitchenSink,Controls>text field>Toolbar, The toolbar would not show in landscape orientation. The toolbar performed as expected on the other iOS devices in the test. When in landscape, the "focus to show keyboard with toolbar" could be focused, and the toolbar would flash briefly near the status bar. While this occurs on 1.6.2 as well, the toolbar is never seen while in landscape, not even briefly.
 
Steps to reproduce:
1) Install KS (SDK 1.7.X) onto device
2) Navigate to Controls>text field>Toolbar
3) Focus to show keyboard with toolbar
4) change orientation to landscape

Result:
No toolbar visible

Expected Result:
Toolbar visible

Notes:
OCCURS on 1.6.2
Does not occur on iPad, iPhone 4, iPod touch 3rd gen.
