<h3>Description</h3>

When a module zip file is in the Titanium root directory, then referenced by an app, the zip file is not auto-deployed.  It should be.

   * Couldn't reproduce at all with Android.
   
   * Could only reproduce on iOS when using a development version of the SDK, specifically because I use a symlink from /Library/App.../Titanium/mobilesdk/osx/DEV_1.7.X --->>  /Users/bill/src/titanium_mobile/dist/mobilesdk/osx/1.7.2.  The presence of the symlink causes the search for modules to occur in /Users/bill/src/titanium_mobile/dist instead of /Library/App.../Titanium (side-effect of abspath() in Python?)
   
   @NOLAN can you confirm whether this was the same scenario in which you were experiencing this?</li>

   Test case for QE:
   
   
   * Check your /Library/Application Support/Titanium/modules/iphone folder.  If there is a ti.barcode folder there, delete it with rm -r <code>ti.barcode</code>.
   
   * Create a new app/project in Titanium Studio.  Make sure that project targets 1.7.0 or 1.7.1 (our production releases, NOT a symlink of a still-in-development version of Titanium Mobile).
   
   * Copy the ti.barcode-iphone-1.1.zip (which I send you by e-mail) to /Library/Application Support/Titanium.
   
   * Build/release that project to the iPhone Simulator.
   
   * Check /Library/Application Support/Titanium/modules/iphone folder.  Is there now a ti.barcode sub-folder? (There should be.)

   Looks like this is fixed. I added an additional step (which I assumed): Added "<module version="1.1">ti.barcode</module>" to TiApp.xml prior to building. I ran two tests:
   1) With no barcode module at /library/application support/Titanium/modules/iPhone, and the zip at /library/application support/Titanium, the zip was removed, and added was the structure /library/application support/Titanium/modules/iPhone/ti.barcode/1.1/. 
   2) With an existing ti.barcode version 1.0 installed, with the 1.1 zip located at /library/application support/Titanium, the zip was removed, and a new folder created at library/application support/Titanium/modules/iPhone/ti.barcode/1.1/. In this scenario, both 1.1 and 1.0 versions were located in the ti.barcode folder. I am running Xcode 4.0, and used release 1.7.1 to build. I'll verify with Thomas that he doesn't want any other testing before closing.</li>

   Though QE was satisfied, I kept this open to evaluate the dev time bug I was seeing (described in my first comment) when symlinks were used.  This has now also been fixed (since july 13 actually :) ).
   
   The problem started with this community contribution:
   
   <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/commit/fb473409c3d3f4dafcc3e48d3b750adf61bed7c6#support/iphone/builder.py" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/commit/fb473409c3d3f4dafcc3e48d3b750adf61bed7c6#support/iphone/builder.py</a>
   
   Marshall fixed it with this commit:
