<h3>Description</h3>

Customer would like the ability to detect the SIM card and detect a SIM card change.

Apps like WHATSAPP will immediately recognize that the SIM card has changed, and force the user to walk through the SMS-Verification-process it does when installing the app at first.

The ability to identify a SIM Card change, allows apps to act on that action which can be a very important feature for user authentication.

   You need put in a more detailed use case about this. Why they want it, want they want to do, etc., etc. Reassign to don when you have this.</li>

   Developer's app needs to know if a SIM card was changed from the time of the first app launch and the second or third.  If SIM card is changed, developer would like to take action.</li>
