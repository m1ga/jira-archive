<h3>Description</h3>

Users would like to have an iPad specific resource folder just like the android and iphone folders to store iPad specific resources when creating a universal binary project.

   OK'd by Android team.  They support android/X subdirectories, where X is a device resolution (and is pre-determined by Google).
   
   However, after a discussion with Don, we should force a new directory structure for platform-specific resources. We cannot have a strictly Resources/ipad directory - then common data between iphone and ipad could not be combined (no clue which from what directory is appropriate) without duplication.  Therefore, we should have:
   
   Resources/platform/ios - Common resources for iOS devices
   Resources/platform/ios/iphone - iPhone/iPod-specific resources
   Resources/platform/ios/ipad - iPad-specific resources</li>

   After working on this for a while and trying to interpret this, came up with at least four mutually exclusive interpretations of what needs to be implemented. Need a test case of the file structure expected from the project, and the file structure expected in the built app, AND what js should call to access the various files.</li>

   In talking with Don, it turns out that, beyond the 'android' folder, the naming/folder conventions are done by the OS. However, on iOS, folders are not used to fix namespace conflicts. Instead, the file has a specific naming convention.

   We honor this for images. That is, in the iPhone folder, you can specify:
   * foo.gif will work in all cases, but can be overridden
   * foo@2x~iphone.gif will override on retina display ipods and iphones
   * foo@2x.gif will also override on retina display ipods and iphones
   * foo~iphone.gif will override on any display ipods and iphones
   * foo~ipad.gif will override on ipads
   
   This is only for graphics, but no folder is necessary for this.</li>

   See comments: In short, there already exists an Apple-provided naming convention to keep images iPad-only or iPhone-only when fetching them at runtime.</li>

   Will the same convention work with js files?</li>

   Closing ticket as invalid.</li>
