					"body": "Thanks, Ronnie -- I saw your workaround.  I think it works great in a playlist scenario, where the user is actively switching from clip to clip.  But in my case, I need to detect that the user has passively allowed the clip to play to completion, so I can treat it as a successful preroll playback.  I don't think there's a clean way to do that.  \r\n\r\nIf I could intercept the user clicking on the \"back\" button to close the window, I could ignore the next complete event.  But the only way I know to do that is to add an event listener to the window's close event.  My gut tells me that the close event will happen *after* the video player's complete event fires.\r\n\r\nThe workaround I've opted to use is to use a function called via setInterval to track the progress of the video playback.  When it gets to the end, I record it as complete.\r\n\r\nBut it's so hacky and inelegant.  This is one of many glitches in the platform that trip developers up, wasting their time debugging Titanium instead of building apps!",
