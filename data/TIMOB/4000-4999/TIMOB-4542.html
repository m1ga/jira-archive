<h3>Description</h3>

Customer would like the ability to detect the SIM card and detect a SIM card change.

Apps like WHATSAPP will immediately recognize that the SIM card has changed, and force the user to walk through the SMS-Verification-process it does when installing the app at first.

The ability to identify a SIM Card change, allows apps to act on that action which can be a very important feature for user authentication.

   On iOS, we can detect if someone changes the SIM card while the application is running.  This ability is unavailable on Android devices because the battery must be removed to change the SIM.  On iOS, we can get notified if the carrier changes while the application is running, but this event would also trigger if the device is set into "Airplane Mode".  It will not be possible to achieve feature parity on this feature request as stated.  It may be possible to define a more refined use case for this given more specifics about the client's desire.</li>

   Closing ticket due to time passed and irrelevance. </li>
