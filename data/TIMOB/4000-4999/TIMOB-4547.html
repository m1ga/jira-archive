<h3>Description</h3>

After running the transport.py script, the language files are being lost (the app shows the key ref. for the locale text) & the resources folder has all the default Appcelerator Titanium appicon.png, default.png etc. files instead of app-specific files.

   Hi Alan--Is this specific to Titanium Studio? I'm not sure we have any control over that script.</li>

   Ingo, this is something that we need the Studio team to manage.  This is a feature that needs to be added into TiStudio.</li>

   Alan, the scripts have to work even without the studio, so I think that this should not be done on the studio side.</li>

   Investigated what the hell transport.py was even supposed to be doing and how it works. Concluded that it "works as designed" but unfortunately "as designed" is fundamentally incompatible with "sets up an xcode project for transport" which is, _in theory_, what the script does.
   
   Marking this ticket as a dupe of TIMOB-2674 as a result.</li>

   The issue at hand is that transport.py doesn't even work to begin with.</li>

   Closing as duplicate.</li>
