<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Problem</h4>
The build.py included with new modules will run any file in the documentation folder through markdown, including .DS_Store and other files that should be ignored. This results in an error being thrown, and the documentation not being generated.

<h4>How To Reproduce</h4>
1. Create a new module for iOS
2. Copy a .DS_Store file in to the documentation directory
3. ./build.py and you will see an error message; the resulting zip will not have documentation in it

   Updated the pull request to ignore directories as well. If you had a .svn folder in there, the build would fail. Should be 100% good to go now.</li>

   Bumped up customer prio; a couple customers have noticed this. The fix is pretty innocuous, so it would be nice if we could squeeze it in to the next release. It's quick and easy for QE to test, too.</li>

   Bumped up priority; Android has a fix in already, and the pull just needs to be reviewed & accepted.</li>

   Thanks Dawson for the fix and pull request.</li>
