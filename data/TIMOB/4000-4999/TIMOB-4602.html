<h3>Description</h3>

Description:
While testing KitchenSink, I noticed that the Orientation being reported has changed in 1.7.2. In 1.7.1 and earlier, iPad reports one of the following: Face Up, Face Down, Landscape left, landscape right, portrait, upside portrait, and unknown.  In 1.7.2,  Landscape left has become "reverse landscape" and landscape right has become "Landscape". Upside portrait is now "reverse portrait"

Steps to reproduce:
1) Build KS
2) Install on iPad 2
3) Navigate to Phone>Orientation
4) Rotate device to all it's orientations
5) Note the reported orientation

Result:
Landscape left and right replaced with "Landscape" and "reverse landscape", Upside portrait now "Reverse portrait"

Expected:
No change in orientation reporting

   This is actually a functional test change by Opie, due to Android's capabilities. Android does not have a concept of "landscape left" and "landscape right" - it refers to them as "landscape" and "reverse landscape."  In a conversation with him, I determined:
   
   - Landscape = LANDSCAPE_RIGHT
   - Reverse landscape = LANDSCAPE_LEFT
   
   for iOS. There may be constant name changes in 1.8.0, but there are NO API changes in 1.7.2.
   
   From now on, when testing orientation, please make sure that the device reports these accurately (this bug report seems to indicate that they do).</li>

   Worth noting that we also decided:
   
   - Portrait = PORTRAIT
   - Reverse portrait = UPSIDE_PORTRAIT
   
   Again, these seem to be reported correctly.</li>

   Closing ticket as it will not fix.</li>
