<h3>Description</h3>

Description:
While testing KitchenSink, I noticed that the iPad gesture "4-finger swipe" was reporting  in the log that the app was pausing and resuming. It also seems to change reported orientation when device is face up.

Jul  6 10:30:04 unknown UIKitApplication:com.appcelerator.pushtest[0xca96][398] <Notice>: [INFO] app was paused from the foreground
Jul  6 10:30:06 unknown UIKitApplication:com.appcelerator.pushtest[0xca96][398] <Notice>: [DEBUG] fire app event: resumed
Jul  6 10:30:06 unknown UIKitApplication:com.appcelerator.pushtest[0xca96][398] <Notice>: [INFO] app has resumed from the background
 
Steps to reproduce:
1) Build KS with 1.7.2 rcb4d2d0e
2) Install on iPad 2
3) Navigate to Phone > Orientation
4) Check console output
5) Place device face-up on table
6) Perform 4-finger swipe
7) Note the reported orientation and check log output

Result:
Log reports pause from foreground and resume
Orientation may report change

Expected:
No change in orientation reporting, no application pause

Notes:
Also occurs when same KS built with 1.7.1

This may be two root causes.... If so I will break out and report a separate bug.
