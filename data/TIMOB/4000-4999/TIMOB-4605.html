<h3>Description</h3>

Description:
While testing KitchenSink, Controls>Picker>Basic picker 2, I noticed that the font point sizes were changing as I manipulated the picker. The text size seems to toggle as you pull the picker to the limit then beyond repeatedly.

Looking at the .js, there are point sizes specified for each picker row item for the test. The bug may be related to this, as no other KS picker has this issue, and none of them specify font size.

 
Steps to reproduce:
1) Build KS with 1.7.2 rcb4d2d0e
2) Install on iPad 2
3) Navigate to Controls>Picker>Basic picker 2
4) pull picker to the extent (up or down)
5) Try to pull beyond extent
6) Repeat step 5

Result:
Depending on which way you try to go, either Strawberries or Mangos will toggle from large to small.

Expected:
No point size change, unless desired effect is to simulate text on cylinder

Notes:
Also occurs when same KS built with 1.7.1
