<h3>Description</h3>

Every time drillbit is launched now it fires up an emulator. It's also loading an API level 4 emulator by default, the default should now be API level 7.

Please correct drillbit to not launch an emulator until run is pressed and then have it be a level 7 emulator if one isn't already running.

   timob-4624 will be fixed in timob-4373 since timob-4373 makes it to where the tester can choose a device or emulator after launch.</li>

   Drillbit has been replaced with Anvil.</li>
