   The two platform changes I can think of to make this work:
   
    - Make the Rhino debugger module act as a server on the device.
      Right now it connects to studio as a client which won't work with adb port forwarding.
    - If we want to support fastdev this will also require a server/client switch.
      Right now fastdev works only on emulator by using a special host IP. We would need to switch to using adb forward.
    - Add tooling support for device discovery, setting up the port forwarding, and installing/launching the app w/ debugger info.</li>

   Lets implement this feature for V8 and not for Rhino. I agree with Stephen that Josh and Max together would be the right resources to implement this feature.</li>

   As a user, I think it makes sense that it would be V8-only.</li>

   Test instructions:
   Use any Titanium Studio nightly build later than 2012-08-22. (e.g <a href="http://10.0.1.52/hudson/view/titanium-dev/job/titanium-installer-mac-development/)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://10.0.1.52/hudson/view/titanium-dev/job/titanium-installer-mac-development/)</a>
   Open an app (KS for example) in App Explorer.
   Set any breakpoints in the source code (e.g app.js)
   Click on Debug toolbar button in App Explorer and select "Android Device"
   Switch to Debug perspective (may be prompted)
   TiStudio Debug view will show active debugger session.
   Android application logging should appear in TiStudio console.
   Depending on breakpoint(s) set, the execution may be suspended.</li>
