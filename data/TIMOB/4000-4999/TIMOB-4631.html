<h3>Description</h3>

launching emulator via Tistudio with r12 SDK tools installed on Window 7 64bit causes launch failure that stems from a problem with the new tools being unable to handle white space properly. A work around for part of this problem is to first have the Android SDK installed to a path without a space ("C:\Android\android-sdk-windows" rather than "C:\Program Files (x86)\Android\android-sdk-windows").

The second part of the issue is where the builder.py sets the "-logcat" flag and provides logging tags. Apparently the space in ":d *" causes the problem but the Android docs state that a space or comma may be used to separate the logging tags and I verified that the command will work is ":d," is used rather than ":d *". Perhaps builder.py should be changed to adopt the comma format for the logging tags in order to address this.

   To test the fix, you'll need to run this in Windows:
   
   1. Upgrade the Android SDK to r12 SDK _and_ SDK Platform-tools r5
   1. In an existing or new Titanium Project in Titanium Studio, choose Run on Android Emulator.
   2. If the emulator starts (instead of failing), then this bug should be fixed.
