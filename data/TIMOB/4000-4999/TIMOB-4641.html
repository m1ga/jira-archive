<h3>Description</h3>

Description:
While testing a fix for TIMOB-4361 I was trying different combinations of flags for the text field editing in: Controls>Text Field>The Rest. I was able to get the text field to allow typing but no characters show until "space" is pressed, at which point the typed characters show and the insertion point moves.

Steps to reproduce:
1) Install KS built with 1.8.0 r12e5c96a onto an Android device
2) Navigate to Controls>Text Field>The Rest in portrait orientation
3) Tap "clear on edit" three times
4) Focus on text field and type something
5) Click "done" to dismiss keyboard
6) Rotate to landscape mode
7) focus on text field and begin typing

Result:
Characters typed into the field do not appear until space is pressed

Expected:
All characters appear as expected. 

Notes: See attached images. Image1 shows field after I typed "black", image 2 after I hit the spacebar.
Also occurs in KS built with 1.7.1.
Does not seem to occur on Xoom running 3.1.

   This should be invalid or severity trivial at best case. Programmatically you would never have this scenario. The clearOnEdit would be set during control creation and not changed throughout its lifetime.</li>

   Hello Don, I would be happy to change the severity if required. The "tap three times" step was to ensure the right setting. Here is some sample code that shows the issue without any buttons and with clearOnEdit set during control creation. I think the issue is related to the text field listener since I can't seem to get it to occur without it.
   
   Steps:
   1) launch
   2) Focus on field, type something
   3) tap "done" to dismiss keyboard
   4) Rotate to landscape
   5) Tap the field again
   6) Type
   
   var win=Ti.UI.createWindow();
   
   var tf1 = Titanium.UI.createTextField({
   	color:'#336699',
   	top:40,
   	left:40,
   	width:250,
   	height:80,
   	hintText:'hintText',
   	clearOnEdit:true,
   	keyboardType:Titanium.UI.KEYBOARD_DEFAULT,
   	returnKeyType:Titanium.UI.RETURNKEY_DEFAULT,
   	borderStyle:Titanium.UI.INPUT_BORDERSTYLE_ROUNDED
   });
   
   tf1.addEventListener('return', function()
   {
   	tf1.blur();
   });
   
   win.add(tf1);
   win.open();</li>
