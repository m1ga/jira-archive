<h3>Description</h3>

Need to be making sure that we generate coverage for some classes which don't follow naming conventions on iOS, such as Ti2DMatrix and Ti3DMatrix. These classes should be getting extracted as part of the API metrics already, just need to be processed accurately.

   No need for QE to confirm the ticket it was just to ensure that 2d/2d matrix classes where properly being included in iOS Coverage and some very minor doc changes. So going to mark this ticket as closed.</li>
