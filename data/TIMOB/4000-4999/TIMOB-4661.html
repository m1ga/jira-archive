<h3>Description</h3>

Description:
While testing KitchenSink iPad in landscape mode, on the Main Tests>Popovers>Popover 3 test, I scrolled the view from View 1 to View 2. As I scrolled, I rotated to portrait. The result was the popover window was 25%-30% smaller. This test is most likely an edge case as you must hold the view half-scrolled while rotating for it to occur reliably. 

Note: Does not occur with the same steps but from portrait to landscape. See attached screenshot.

Steps to reproduce:
1) Launch KS iPad built with 1.7.2
2) Navigate to Main Tests>Popovers>Popover 3
3) Ensure device is in landscape mode
4) With the scrollable view up, scroll the view so half of view 1 and half of view 2 is visible.
5) Rotate to portrait while continuing to hold the view half-scrolled

Result:
The scrollable view size is reduced, see screenshot

Expected:
Scrollable view size remains the same
