<h3>Description</h3>

Description:
While testing KitchenSink iPad, on the "Bug 3298" test, I ran through the test, and then attempted to relaunch the test by clicking the button again. Nothing happens, no buttons are active, and you remain on the main test screen. If the device is rotated to landscape, (if in landscape, rotate portrait then back again to landscape) then the master view reappears, overlaying the main menu. Once in this state, you can close the master view, and reproduce the bug, but can't reopen the test you see the first time you press the "Bug 3298" button.

Steps to reproduce:
1) Launch KS iPad built with 1.7.2
2) Tap the "Bug 3298" button
3) Rotate to landscape to access the master view
4) Tap "Close" from the master view
5) At the main menu, tap the "Bug 3298" button again

Result:
Buttons deactivate, nothing visible unless you rotate to port, then back to landscape, then master view appears over main menu

Expected:
Relaunch of test for Bug 3298

Note: 
This test is new for the 1.7.2 timeframe so unsure if it's supported for 1.7.1 and prior. I attempted to run the test with KS iPad built with 1.7.1, and at first it seemed to function as expected, but then crashed. 
** THE ATTACHED CRASH LOG AND CONSOLE OUTPUT ARE FROM THE 1.7.1-built KS iPad.**

   Forgot that we can't resolve until pull is accepted, oops.</li>

   Can't pass functional test; while test does improve upon original bug, there is a crasher:
   
       * Launch app
       * Rotate ipad to portrait
       * Tap 'bug 3298'
       * Tap 'menu'
       * Tap 'close'
       * Rotate ipad to landscape
       * Note 'menu' button there as well as the main view sidebar.
       * Tapping 'menu' will cause a crash. -- Looks like it's the orphaned old menu button.
