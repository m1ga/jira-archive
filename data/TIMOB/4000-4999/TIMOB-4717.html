   The test app allows you to play with the <code>message</code>, <code>ok</code>, <code>messageid</code> and <code>okid</code> both before and after the dialog object is created.

   Hello Bill, any instructions for expected results on your test app? Seems comprehensive.

   Better testing instructions.  The other was pretty  vague :).
   
   Start with the "Play with 'message' and 'ok'".  This lets you play with setting the alert dialog's "message" and "ok" properties.  At that window, you can click any of those "Set ..." options, then when you click the "Show Dialog" button make sure the dialog's message and the text on the "OK" button (which is the only button) match the last options that you clicked on.
   
   Then go back and click the "Play with 'messageid' and 'okid'.  This lets you mess around with setting the dialog's "messageid" and "okid" properties.  These "*id" properties are used for local strings (English, German, whatever.)  Specifically, the id values are defined in the file i18n/de/strings.xml (for German) and i18n/en/strings.xml (for English).  So if you click "set okid prop to 'ok1'" and then "set messagid prop to 'message1'", then click "Show Dialog", you should see a dialog that has "english message1" as the dialog's message and "english ok1" as the text on the button, because those are the values that are assigned in i18n/en/strings.xml.  (I'm assuming you have English set as your language on your phone.  You can also change your phone's settings to German and test it if you want.)</li>
