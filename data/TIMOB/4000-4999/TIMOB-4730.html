<h3>Description</h3>

1.update your sdk install to include 3.2
2.target 3.2 as the run config and launch the emulator 

results: we see 2 things occur
1.time out with no emulator launched
2. emulator launches, but is useless (half the screen renders, buttons do not work etc)

fwiw, lion and 10.6.8 work as expected

Also, as per Don this is not a studio or TIMOB issue

   I'm resolving this because "poor" performance depends on the hardware and type of Android emulator. If you are using a hardware accelerated emulator such as the x86 HAXM Android emulator or Genymotion, things are pretty darn fast. Now that the new Android build system allows you to select a specific Android emulator, it should never launch a useless emulator and it's up to you to configure a fast x86-based emulator.</li>

   Closing ticket as it is not our bug.</li>
