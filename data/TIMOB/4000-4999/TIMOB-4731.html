<h3>Description</h3>

Description:
After acquiring and installing Lion, I was attempting to perform studio packaging tests. While I could run and distribute for Android, all builds I attempted with iOS failed with something like this:
[INFO] One moment, building ...

   Turns out QE had an out of date beta, the most recent beta (b3) is behaving as expected. Closing.</li>
