Module resources are not copied to the application resources when the module is located in the system folder.

This can be seen with the Android BarCode module installed in the system folder.

   Occurs during the build process. The generated R.java file does not have entries for any of the resources because they were not copied.</li>

   Use this project (in the attached zip file) for testing.  You will also need the barcode module, which I can send to you via e-mail when you ask.</li>

   Testing:
   
   * Put the barcode module zip file in the top-level system titanium folder (<code>/Library/Application Support/Titanium</code>) on OSX.
   * Unzip that file in place.  It will result in /Library/Application Support/Titanium/modules/android/ti.barcode being created.
   * Unzip the attached project (in the attached zip file).
   * Build/Run that project.
   * After it's done building, open the R.java file down in <code>build/android/gen/com/billdawson/timob4739</code>.  It should have a bunch of entries in it, well over 200 lines of code.</li>
