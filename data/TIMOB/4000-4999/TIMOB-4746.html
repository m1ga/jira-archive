<h3>Description</h3>

Is it just me, or does Titanium on Android not get the orientation of the initial splash screen right at launch when the device is in landscape?

Launching a test application with the default Appcelerator logo as the splash screen (or KitchenSink, with its "sink" splash screen), everything works fine in portrait.

But launching with the device held landscape, the splash screen appears stretched horizontally, as if the portrait image is being used and just stretched out.

Note that in landscape the splash screen doesn't always appear at launch, and when it does it's usually just for a flash.

Note #2: This doesn't seem to happen in a subsequent launch as described in TIMOB-4357.  In that instance, when it relaunches before the described, the orientation of the splash screen behaves properly.  (It also seems to slide in from the side, as opposed to zooming in as a regular from-scratch launch does.)

   Upon investigating further, I realize this only happens when I have my launcher (Go Launcher Ex, to be exact) set to portrait-only mode.  But other Android apps behave properly -- i.e., displaying the landscape-mode splash screen -- so I'm still counting this as a Titanium bug.

   TIMOB-1674 seems to provide instructions for a "raw" workaround.  When will this be supported in the "standard" Titainum splash screen directory structure (e.g. Resources\android\images\res-notlong-land-mdpi)?</li>

   This solution worked for me.

   Resolving ticket as Invalid as there is now a new version of Kitchen Sink available and we no longer support the version which relates to this ticket.</li>
