<h3>Description</h3>

While testing KS, Base UI>Views>Table Views>Update row objects, I was scrolling the table view and when you do this quickly, the image located in each row (a blue speech bubble) is rendered about an inch to the left of where it should. This happens only when scrolling quickly, and only on some attempts.

Steps to Reproduce:
1) Install KS 1.7.2
2) Navigate to Base UI>Views>Table Views>Update row objects and launch test
3) Scroll rapidly up and down


Result:
Speech bubble image is not always rendered on the right border of the row

Expected result:
Speech bubbles rendered at the right border every time

   Bug was discovered as a consequence of this fix. Going to have to handle it in a slightly more sophisticated manner.</li>
