					"body": "This ticket was made during the XML Node drillbit test work and specifically because {{shouldBeExactly}} was failing.  In a [pull request|https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/pull/221] comment I mention that I don't think {{shouldBeExactly}} can work, so this ticket is probably invalid.  If meant to refer to {{shouldBe}} (as opposed to {{shouldBeExactly}}), it's a duplicate of TIMOB-4703.\r\n\r\nI pasted my reasoning from the pull request comment here as well:\r\n\r\nIt's my opinion that we can't ever use {{shouldBeExactly}} with node proxies (nodes, elements, attributes, etc.).  {{shouldBeExactly}} uses {{===}}, which in the case of non-String, non-Number and non-Boolean objects \"return(s) true if x and y refer to the same object\".  (From [ECMAScript|http://www.ecmascript.org/docs.php] spec.)  They'll never refer to the same object in our case, because we take what the underlying XML DOM library gives us and wrap it in a proxy on every function/property call.   So although we may be wrapping the same underlying object in the proxies, the proxies themselves are different objects.  {{==}} (and thus {{shouldBe}}) will work if the pull request for TIMOB-4703 gets put in, but {{===}} and {{shouldBeExactly}} will never work.\r\n\r\nTo put it another way, we don't keep our own tree of proxies that mirrors the underlying document tree.  This is unlike our {{Titanium.UI}} view hierarchy implementation, in which we really do keep {{children}} collections containing proxies that mirror the underlying children collection of a native Android View.",
