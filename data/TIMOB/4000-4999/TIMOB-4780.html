<h3>Description</h3>

Initially when a new Titanium Mobile project is created, we create it with some default placeholder images, configuration in tiapp.xml, and other things. If a project is created with only one platform target, then only the resources for that platform are copied into the project.

It would be nice if Titanium developers could issue an SDK command to copy the default project resources for a platform into their existing project if it wasn't initially targeted to that platform.

Currently we have a number of commands on our "titanium.py" script, so this would be a new command along the lines of:

titanium.py copy_resources --platform=<platform> <project dir>
