<h3>Description</h3>

Need to sketch out the APIs for the new drawing layer for layouts, and get feedback from both Marshall and the rest of the iOS team as to feasibility, coverage of issues we might expect, fit with our existing API (expected to be low...) and other assorted ridiculousness.

   Sketched prototype outside Titanium and submitted as a separate repo, which we can maintain if we so choose (but which will probably be deleted).
   
   We need a side-projects repo for stuff like this, sample apps, etc. so that we can easily share.</li>
