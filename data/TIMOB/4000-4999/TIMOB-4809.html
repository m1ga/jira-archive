<h3>Description</h3>

Developers often have cruft sitting in their Resource folders that they don't want copied into their product Resource directory.  Additionally, we get requests from customers and the field (including pull requests) asking for changes to compiler.py to exclude their files (i.e. .bundle directories, etc.).  We should implement a generalized solution, akin to a .gitignore file that compiler.py refers to for ignoring files during the copy resources phase.  Formatting should be simple; one pattern per line matched against the files for exclusion.  I'd like to see this in 1.8 so I can disregard and close a pending pull request and avoid further pull requests and possible Jira filings.

   Reassigning, due to Reggie's absence.</li>

   Closing this in deference to TIMOB-3797 and TIMOB-2478 which already exist and cover this case.</li>
