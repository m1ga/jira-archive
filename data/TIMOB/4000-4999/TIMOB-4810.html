<h3>Description</h3>

Need to update the Horizontal and Vertical layouts to use the new layout management system. This task can theoretically be completed as soon as the Graphite API is finalized/approved (or mostly so), but cannot be functional tested until the API layer is complete. Will also help to have the Composite rules finished beforehand because they largely inform how Horiz/Vert work (and rules for H/V are even included in the composite behavior spec, I believe).

   Composite behavior will inform H/V and we may even be able to make them subclasses of whatever rules describe Composite.</li>

   Reassigning to Vishal as he did the work on composite. Note that this can only be completed after the composite layout pull request is merged.</li>
