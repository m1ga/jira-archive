<h3>Description</h3>

Editing the tiapp.xml file should force the project to be rebuilt--not a clean. Awaiting a command-line option from the SDK to implement this.

   This is certainly fixed for iOS.
   
   I'm pretty certain this is not fixed for Android.
   
   No idea about Windows.</li>

   Just to clarify, the issue here is that Android is *NOT* doing incremental builds. It's always rebuilding the entire project. Even if no changes were made. I've confirmed this.
   
   *Steps to reproduce:*
   <h4>Open a project in Appcelerator Studio.</h4>
   <h4>Build and run for Android.</h4>
   <h4>Build and run the same project again. (Do not edit any files.)</h4>
   <h4>Search the Appcelerator Studio "Console" panel for "javac".</h4>
   
   *Result:*
   The project was completely recompiled/re-built even though no changes were made. This is a productivity issue.

   Closing as won't fix this is now fixed in 9.0</li>
