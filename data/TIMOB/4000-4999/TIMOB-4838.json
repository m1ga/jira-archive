					"body": "Will need a sample app/source that shows what the app does with the payload once they receive it. I have a sneaking suspicion that the JS code presents a dialog from notification. If this is the case, then the bug is invalid:\n\nIf an application is running when the notification comes in, it should NOT present a dialog -- the user is already in the application -- but should update the information in the background with the payload. Similarly, when launched from an alert, the payload can be used to direct the application onto where to focus.\n\nFor example, in an SMS app, if you receive an SMS, you do NOT get a dialog alerting you. Instead, the list of conversations is updated. When not in an SMS app and a notification happens, the OS provides an alert as an offering to view the SMS in detail. If the user so takes the offer, the payload is passed onto the app in order for the app to update the focus.",
