<h3>Description</h3>

Description:
In KitchenSink, on Phone>Geolocation, there is a "Reverse Geolocation" field. We had experienced some failures from the 3rd party providing this data, and during the investigation noted that while iOS devices would return "Reverse Geo Error" alerts at this time, the Android would not. I added some traces to the code, but it seems like the section that contains the Reverse Geo block, and starting at line 373 of geolocation.js is not getting called. Either way, there is no alert on failure.

Steps to reproduce:
1) Launch Kitchensink
2) Navigate to Phone>Geolocation (note, this will fail if 15k+ queries are made that day)
3) Look at the reverse Geo section

Result:
No alert, no content in reverse geo field.

Expected:
Reverse geo completed, OR reverse geo failed alert

   Here is the output Chung is seeing when the geolocation test is run on a Nexus S:
   {"success":true,
