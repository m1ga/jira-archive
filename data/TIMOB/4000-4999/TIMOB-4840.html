<h3>Description</h3>

Always on file level encryption was added to 1.8.  We need an option to enable/disable it on a per file basis.

   Issue must be fixed before 1.8.0 release to address issues with pull req. 313/TIMOB-3076.</li>

   This bug is a request for the feature completion of TIMOB-3076.</li>

   After further review, we do not need a public API.  When the client uses background services, file protection is automatically disabled.  When background services are no longer registered, file protection is reenabled and the files become protected the next time their written according to the Apple spec.</li>
