<h3>Description</h3>

Description:
While running Drillbit on Lion, I noted that the iOS tests were not completing. The test would list "running" and the simulator would launch. The console would report application launch then immediately "app has quit from simulator". Android tests were completing as expected. Drillbit would remain with "running" in the status indefinately.

Steps to reproduce:
1) Git pull from master
2) Scons
3) switch to drill bit folder
4) in terminal, type "python drillbit.py"
5) Select a single iOS and click "run tests"

Result:
Test app launches and quits immediately. No results are recorded. Drillbit stays in state.

Expected:
Test completes and results reported.
