<h3>Description</h3>

1. Create an application with one or more small views.
2. Add some buttons which would create a matrix and would fire scale method on the matrix.
3. Animate the views using the new matrix information.

Current Behavior (Scale Method Issues):

Case 1: If one argument is passed while using scale method, scale method takes it as the value for both x-coord and y-coord.

Case2 : Origin 

While executing scale method,
Android treats Top Left corner as the origin.
iPhone treats the center point as the origin.

Case3 : If we pass one positive and one negative value, the output is going to be weird (image would shrink to zero and reverse its coordinates which is expected as you cannot do it in any other way if its 2D and not 3D)

Case4 : Firing click events repeatedly

If we click on the buttons repeatedly which fires scale method,
iPhone fires/executes the clicked event only once. Remembers previous value.
Android starts every click function from the ideal Identity matrix position(initial position). Does not consider previous value.


Android Bug:

While increasing 'y' when 'x's is kept stationary(unchanged) at standard value of Identity matrix i.e. '1', it does not do anything. 
i.e. 'Y' is not shrinking nor expanding when 'x' does something else.

Expected Behavior:

Unknown
