<h3>Description</h3>

1. Create an application with one or more small views.
2. Add some buttons which would create a matrix and would fire translate method on the matrix.
3. Animate the views using the new matrix information.

Current Behavior (Translate Method Issues):

1. Android gives error if only one argument is passed in translate method saying '2 arguments required' while iPhone treats that single value for both tx and ty.

2. Firing click events repeatedly

If we click on the buttons repeatedly which fires translate method,
iPhone fires/executes the clicked event only once. Remembers previous value
Android starts every click function from the ideal Identity matrix position(initial position). 

Expected Behavior:

Unknown

   * Translation:
   
   Translate a box from the left end of the view to the right end of the view:
   - iOS: Translates exactly once [BUG]
   - Android: Translates repeatedly; subsequent translations snap the box back to its original position [BUG]
   - Expected: Translate occurs from existing position as many times as requested, not bounded by any containers
   
   * Rotation
   Rotate a box 360 degrees:
   - iOS: No rotation (start point is same as end point) [BUG]
   - Android: Rotates completely [OK]
   - Expected: Complete rotation</li>
