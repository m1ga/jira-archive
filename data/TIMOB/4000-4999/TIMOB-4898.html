<h3>Description</h3>

Would like to easily be able to determine the filename associated with the URI for a voice recording.

We are using the sample voice recorder code from this appcelerator blog post to create the audio files:

[Appcelerator Developer Blog Launching Activities and Using Content URIs in Android](<a href="http://developer.appcelerator.com/blog/2011/02/launching-activities-and-using-content-uris-in-android.html)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://developer.appcelerator.com/blog/2011/02/launching-activities-and-using-content-uris-in-android.html)</a>

but once we have the recordings we have no way to identify what the file names are so that we can rename them and transfer back to our web back-end.

   This requires some code to show what you are doing at the moment to achieve this, with some pseudo code that demonstrates how this proposed API function would work from a user perspective.
