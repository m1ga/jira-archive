<h3>Description</h3>

When FastDev server is running, images (on/off) of the tabbar in Tweetanium are not displayed.
If the FastDev property is set to false in tiapp.xml, all images are displayed.

See [ApplicationWindow.js](<a href="https://github.com/appcelerator-titans/tweetanium/blob/master/mobile/Tweetanium/Resources/tweetanium/ui/ApplicationWindow.js)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator-titans/tweetanium/blob/master/mobile/Tweetanium/Resources/tweetanium/ui/ApplicationWindow.js)</a>

Before running the project I removed the build directory and cleaned the project.
The project is installed in the default Titanium workspace folder in Windows 7.
In my case the first time doesn't show the images in the tabbar, only the one in the top-right corner (after closing the Account window) is showed correctly.

Setting the property "ti.android.fastdev" to false in tiapp.xml solved the problem.

I also find a workaround to work with FastDev server enabled by copying the tabbar images 
to the platform specific directory of Android (Recources/android/images/res-hdpi etc.)

   FastDev has some strange behaviours.
   All images in project Tweetanium are referenced via path 'images\...' This works for the header view but fails for the tabbar button images. If I move the tabbar images to Resource\android\images\res-<hdpi/mdpi/ldpi> folders, the images are shown correctly.
   
   I have no idea why this happens only for the tabbar images in ApplicationWindow.js</li>

   Please try the latest Continuous Build 1.7.X, and state the Titanium SDK build date and hash in the environment field. Then I will be happy to move this over.
   
   Cheers</li>

   Please also state the exact Android version tested.

   Tabbar icons are not displayed when FastDev is enabled.</li>

   Hi Paul,
   
   I have tested with:
   - Titanium Studio, build: 1.0.1.201106171427. Build date: 17 June 2011, 14:29:22
   - Titanium mobile SDK, build 1.7.2.v20110707155439, sha1: c31bc0109c7d6fed707882c39b6d99a91a979ba1
   - Android SDK 2.2
   
   Before running the project I removed the build directory and cleaned the project.
   The project is installed in the default Titanium workspace folder in Windows 7.
   In my case the first time doesn't show the images in the tabbar, only the one in the top-right corner (after closing the Account window) is showed correctly.
   
   Setting the property "ti.android.fastdev" to false in tiapp.xml solved the problem.
   
   I also find a workaround to work with FastDev server enabled by copying the tabbar images 
   to the platform specific directory of Android (Recources/android/images/res-hdpi etc.)
   
   Maybe the problem is a referral/copying of resources issue.
   
   Regards,
   Erik

   Erik
   
   Thank you for your update - it was useful. I have amended the ticket. Would you kindly read the [Jira Ticket Checklist](<a href="http://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides/Contributing+to+Titanium#ContributingtoTitanium-Summary%3AJiraTicketChecklist)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides/Contributing+to+Titanium#ContributingtoTitanium-Summary%3AJiraTicketChecklist)</a> and bear the following notes in mind when raising your next ticket?
   
   * tickets really need a proper usecase, in the body of the ticket, as explained in [Creating Good Use-cases](<a href="http://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides/Contributing+to+Titanium#ContributingtoTitanium-CreatingGoodUsecases)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides/Contributing+to+Titanium#ContributingtoTitanium-CreatingGoodUsecases)</a>
   * all the definitive information should be in the main body of the ticket, so the issue is clearly defined for the core devs.
   
   I have moved the ticket to the proper project now though.
   
   Thanks for bring this issue to our attention.
   
   Cheers</li>

   btw, the two screenshots look identical to me. Am I overlooking something?</li>
<li>Erik Beugelaar 2011-08-05

   Hi Paul,
   
   No you are not overlooking something. It's my fault. I uploaded the same picture twice.
   My apologizes for that.
   
   Cheers,
