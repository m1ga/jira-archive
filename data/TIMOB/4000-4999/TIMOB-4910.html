<h3>Description</h3>

Currently, the iOS API extraction tool extracts all APIs which match the function signature of those functions which are pubicly available. While this is useful for us to determine what we "accidentally" expose, these methods/properties need to be backlisted in a JSON file (or dictionary, or something) for the coverage script, so that we can get more accurate coverage numbers.

This is expected to be an ongoing task, handled weekly with Marshall during the parity meetings, but there will need to be an initial pass on existing coverage to blacklist stuff we can identify right now.

   Re-resolving. This is an issue that tracks which APIs are published as part of the internal parity checks only.</li>
