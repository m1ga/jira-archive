<h3>Description</h3>

We currently have a broken development model from Eclipse, mostly due to recent changes in ADT as well as various shortcomings in our ant build system and Eclipse. This needs to be fixed -- right now, debugging and building Titanium from Eclipse is almost entirely broken.

   To setup your workspace for this:
   - Close Eclipse, then merge my branch.
   - Do an initial scons build from command line so you get the kroll-apt.jar which Eclipse depends on.
   - Open Eclipse, and create a new Java project called "titanium-dist" inside your workspace
   - Right click on the titanium-dist project, and click New > Folder
   - Use "lib" (without quotes) as the "Folder name"
   - Click the "Advanced" button
   - Choose "Link to alternate location", then click "Browse"
   - Browse / select your titanium_mobile/dist/android folder
   - Click "Finish"
   - At this point you'll probably need to clean the entire workbench.
   
   For any Titanium Android projects you have in your workspace, you'll need to mess with the classpath a bit, namely:
   - Remove any JARs or Project references you previously had
   - In the project Preferences > Android, you'll need to add Android library references to "titanium" and all of the modules. It's a little tedious, but it should only need to be done once per project.
   - In project Preferences > Java Build Path > Libraries, you'll need to make sure all of the JARs in /titanium/lib are included _except_ smalljs.jar and js-debug.jar (Add JARs..)
   - You also need to add /titanium-dist/lib/kroll-apt.jar and jaxen-1.1.1.jar either from your existing project or from /titanium-xml/lib to the project's classpath
   
   At this point, editing code in Eclipse *should* end up with properly generated and compiled code without needing the external ant builder.</li>
