It's a little tedious, but it should only need to be done once per project.\r\n- In project Preferences > Java Build Path > Libraries, you'll need to make sure all of the JARs in /titanium/lib are included _except_ smalljs.jar and js-debug.jar (Add JARs..)\r\n- You also need to add /titanium-dist/lib/kroll-apt.jar and jaxen-1.1.1.jar either from your existing project or from /titanium-xml/lib to the project's classpath\r\n\r\nAt this point, editing code in Eclipse *should* end up with properly generated and compiled code without needing the external ant builder.",
