   After discussing this issue with Reggie, we came to the conclusion that its not a bug its just a different test case. 
   Clicking on Phone->Sound->Local shows the file which is preloaded with the tag "sound.preload=true" but when we click on Phone->Sound->Local with file shows the delay as it is missing that preload tag and is the expected behavior. </li>
