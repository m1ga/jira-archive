<h3>Description</h3>

We need a source code copyright scanner that can do a few sanity checks:
* Warn if a source file doesn't contain our standard copyright headers
** Source files should include at least: (*.java, *.m, *.mm, *.cpp, *.c, *.h, *.xml, *.js, *.py)
** Make sure not to include third party source files, i.e. android/titanium/thirdparty, iphone/Classes/ASIHttpRequest, etc.
* Warn if the year(s) in the copyright don't match the file timestamps
** i.e. if a file was last modified in 2011, it needs to mention 2011 in the copyright header

The script should automatically scan all source files in the titanium_mobile repository, but it should also accept a list of files as input to scan specifically.

Here's an example of our standard copyright header using a Java comment:
<code><pre>
/**
 * Appcelerator Titanium Mobile
 * Copyright (c) 2009-2011 by Appcelerator, Inc. All Rights Reserved.
 * Licensed under the terms of the Apache Public License
 * Please see the LICENSE included with this distribution for details.
 */
</pre></code>

This shows copyright years that cover 2009, 2010, and 2011
