<h3>Description</h3>

I just upgraded my machine to lion and now I can't run an iOS project

looks like xcodebuild is no longer default in the PATH

we might need to work around this somehow in either Studio (or ideally in the actually python scripts, feel free to re-assign if so)

located here:

/Developer/usr/bin/xcodebuild

   When I manually symlinked - i now get the following error for xcode-select
   
   
   [INFO] One moment, building ...

   I can't seem to move this into SDK project.</li>

   Hi Jeff--I moved that over. Not that we did make an update in TiStudio 1.0.4 for the path to developer tools, but I'm not positive that's the same thing here.</li>

   Jeff, if you open Terminal and type "xcode-select -print-path", does it fail ?
   Same for "xcodebuild -showsdks" ?</li>
<li>Ingo Muschenetz 2011-08-12

   Hi Reggie--assigning this over, but let me know if this is something we need to be taking care of.</li>

   I'm gonna guess this has been fixed. Resolving!</li>
