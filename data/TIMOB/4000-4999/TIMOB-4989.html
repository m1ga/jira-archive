<h3>Description</h3>

Reproduction steps, using any app:

- Install the ti.test module
- Change the tiapp.xml for the project to reference the ti.test module
- Set a breakpoint in app
- Debug, and trigger the breakpoint

RESULT:
- Breakpoint is not triggered

EXPECTED:
- Breakpoint is hit


The solution is that because when we load modules (or install to device) we automatically encode javascript into the binary. This prevents the debugger from looking up information (on the filesystem) about which JS is being executed, and furthermore, all the line numbers are going to be wrong anyway due to JS compacting for the encoding process.

So, we'll probably need to stop encoding local resources when you're just linking a module.

   This change had to be pulled out as it was not working on device.</li>
<li>Alan Vaghti 2011-08-29

   Passed as expected on the iPhone Simulator.
   SDK:
   version=1.8.0
   timestamp=08/26/11 14:53
   githash=8e978eb...
   </li>

   This appears to be occurring again with both the iPhone 4.3 and 5 simulator.  Tested with SDK 1.8.0v20110920000211 (version=1.8.0, timestamp=09/20/11 00:02, githash=b8e07c8...).
   
   I've attached the project and break points I was using.  The app stays on the splash screen as expected, but debugger never connects and the variable values never appear. 
   
   After a few seconds the simulator closes and the following appears in the console:
   
   [DEBUG] App Spec: <DTiPhoneSimulatorApplicationSpecifier 0x100126d60> specified by path /Users/avaghti/Documents/Titanium Studio Workspace/debug_test/build/iphone/build/Debug-iphonesimulator/debug_test.app
   [DEBUG] SDK Root: <DTiPhoneSimulatorSystemRoot 0x100124fc0> path=/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneSimulator4.3.sdk version=4.3 name=Simulator - iOS 4.3
   [DEBUG] using device family iphone
   [DEBUG] Session started
   [DEBUG] Session did end with error (null)
   [INFO] Application has exited from Simulator

   Unable to reproduce on master.  This isn't a bug related to debugging modules, either - it is a separate bug.</li>
<li>Stephen Tramer 2011-10-25

   Unable to reproduce in SDK 1.8.0.e69cc8f / TiStud 1.0.6.201110202348 / XCode 4.2 / iOS 5.0 SDK. Assuming previous fix is still good.</li>
<li>Wilson Luu 2011-12-07

   Closing bug. Verified fix on:
   
   OS: Mac OS X Lion
   Titanium Studio, build: 1.0.7.201112061404
   SDK build: 1.8.0.1.v20111207151125
   Device: iOS Simulator (5.0)
   
   Note to QE: Need modulization for modules, not debugging.  </li>
