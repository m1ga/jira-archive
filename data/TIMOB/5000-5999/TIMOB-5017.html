<h3>Description</h3>

This bug covers two things:

- We used to create get/set functions for iOS properties automatically in the coverage data, because this is done for us as part of the internal redirect (p.x= and p.setX() are equivalent, p.x (rvalue) and p.getX() are equivalent). This used to be done, so this is probably as easy as uncommenting something in coverage, or checking a property to see if it's get/set, etc.  Could possibly include some changes to the AST parser so that it detects RO/RW properties correctly.

- We need to blacklist those get/set functions which should NOT appear as part of the public API - it's debatable whether or not we should only have "some" synonyms, but that is a parity discussion with Android. Until this is resolved, we need to be able to blacklist certain properties as "nogetter" and "nosetter".
