<h3>Description</h3>

We need to be able to update the backlists via the blacklister instead of just automatically updating them. In order to do this, we should have the ability to process the "delta" information generated as part of the coverage run, which gives data about what API points were added/removed - obviously we can remove blacklist info for API points that were deleted, and add in blacklists for API points that were added which fit the criteria for blacklisting by cross-referencing with the coverage matrix (if this data isn't available in the delta itself).
