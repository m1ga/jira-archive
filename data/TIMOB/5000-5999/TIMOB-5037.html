<h3>Description</h3>

Right now the coverage report only generates coverage for Proxy/Module properties, but does not automatically generate coverage for accessors. Initially the correct behavior would be to base get/set behavior based on the "permission" flag (read-only: get, write-only: set, read-write: both). We'll also need a new TDoc property for specifying certain properties that don't have accessors (such as "messageid")

   To test this, simply generate and open the coverage report:
   <code><pre>
   $ ./drillbit/coverage/coverage.py
   $ open dist/coverage/index.html
   </pre></code>
   
   Double check that properties defined in TDoc have automatically generated coverage for getter/setter methods under the *API Docs (TDoc)* column.
   
   Generally keep an eye out for:
   
   * Properties with <code>permission: read-only</code> should only show coverage for a getter method
   * Properties with <code>permission: write-only</code> should only show coverage for a setter method
   * Properties with <code>accessors: false</code> show neither
   * Properties with <code>availability: constructor</code> show neither
   * Constants (i.e. CONSTANT_NAME) show neither
   * All other properties by default show both getters and setters</li>

   **NOTE** bullet four above should be <code>availability: creation</code></li>
