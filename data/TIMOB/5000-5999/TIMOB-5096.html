<h3>Description</h3>

This is a flaw in builder.py, given how we softlink to folders in resources and iPhone. That is,
<code><pre>
+ Resources
 - File1
 + FolderA
  - File2
  - File3
 + iPhone
  - File4
  + FolderA
   - File2
   - File5
</pre></code>

Should recursively collapse to:
<code><pre>
+ App
 - File1 (From project resources)
 - File4 (from iPhone)
 + FolderA (New folder)
  - File2 (from iPhone)
  - File3 (From project resources)
  - File5 (from iPhone)
</pre></code>

As it is, it currently builds to:

<code><pre>
+ App
 - File1 (From project resources)
 - File4 (from iPhone)
 + FolderA (from iPhone)
  - File2 (from iPhone)
  - File5 (from iPhone)
</pre></code>

   Not sure if I need to make a test case for this beyond what's described. What's more, one side effect (that I hadn't planned) is manifested as TIMOB-4937, so effectively, we might want to close this as duplicate.</li>

   Resources for a sample project which mimics the directory structure provided in the description.</li>

   <h4>Testing</h4>
   ----
   
   To test:
   
   - Create a new project in TiStudio
   - Download the attached resources, and replace the project's resources with them
   - Clean the project (to ensure a consistent build)
   - Run in simulator
   
   PASS:
   - You should see five pictures of cats, and no errors in the console.
   
   FAIL:
   - Any images do not load, and there is an error in the console about not being able to locate the appropriate resource (images: 1, 2, 5, 3, 4 from upper-left to bottom-right).
   
   ----
   
   Testing should also be performed on device, to ensure consistency of the build process.</li>

   Closing bug. Verified fix on:
   
   OS: Mac OS X Lion
   Titanium Studio, build: 1.0.7.201112080131
   SDK build: 1.8.0.1.v20111207180431
   Devices: iOS Simulator (5.0)</li>
