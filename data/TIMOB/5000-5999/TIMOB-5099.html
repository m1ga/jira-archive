<h3>Description</h3>

Description:
While testing Kitchensink, I noticed a few items in the log that were unexpected. I include them all here, and will break out into unique bugs should any of them be unwanted. These may be expected changes from the additional debug settings enabled during 1.7.2. All items below except the glyph failure can be witnessed in 1.7.2 as well.

Items: 
Various locations

3) Examine console output

Result:

Expected result:
Clear and benign console logging

   There's a pull pending fixing the warning about coverage.  All other warnings are from the device and outside of our control.</li>
