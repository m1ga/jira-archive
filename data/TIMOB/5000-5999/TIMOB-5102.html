<h3>Description</h3>

Description:
While testing Kitchensink, Base UI>Views>Scroll Views>Scrollable View w/o Clipping, I rotated the device after scrolling all the way to the right. Depending on if you follow the steps in landscape or portrait you get different results. From landscape to portrait you end up on a blank view. From portrait to landscape the three-page view returns to the far-left page.

Steps to reproduce:
1) Install KS 1.8.0 on iPod 3rd gen.
2) Navigate to Base UI>Views>Scroll Views>Scrollable View w/o Clipping
3) Rotate device

Result:
If you start in landscape, you end up with an empty view with the page indicator dot on the far right dot. See screenshot.

If you start in portrait, the view scrolls back to the far-left

Expected result:
The page you are viewing is still in view after rotation

Notes:
Occurs on 1.7.2 as well.
