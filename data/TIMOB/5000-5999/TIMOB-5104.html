<h3>Description</h3>

Description:
While testing Kitchensink, Base UI>Animation>transitions, I rotated the device after opening a "full view" window. The window was dismissed and there was no animation.

Steps to reproduce:
1) Install KS 1.8.0 on iPod 3rd gen.
2) Navigate to Base UI>Animation>transitions
3) Tap "full view" button to open a new window
4) Rotate device

Result:
The window is dismissed without animation and unexpectedly

Expected result:
The window remains until dismissed via the button

Notes:
Occurs with 1.7.2 as well.
