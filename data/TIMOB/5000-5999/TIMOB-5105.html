<h3>Description</h3>

Description:
While testing Kitchensink, Base UI>Animation>2D transform, I waited for the cloud animations to complete and noticed that a large image of each cloud was flashed on the screen at the end of the animation cycle.

Steps to reproduce:
1) Install KS 1.8.0 on iPod 3rd gen.
2) Navigate toBase UI>Animation>2D transform
3) Tap "animate" button to begin animation
4) Watch closely as the animations complete

Result:
A large cloud image is flashed at the end of each cloud's animation cycle

Expected result:
The animation completes without additional images being displayed

Notes:
Occurs with 1.7.2 as well.
