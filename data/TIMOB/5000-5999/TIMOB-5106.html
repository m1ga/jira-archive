<h3>Description</h3>

Description:
While testing Kitchensink, I started getting out of memory issues and experienced a crash shortly after. There was no log. A few hours later, I got a crash with a log. This may be difficult to reproduce and may be due to the architecture of the application. Logging for completeness. See attached crash log. Below find example of memory warnings prior to first crash:

Steps to reproduce:
1) Install KS 1.8.0 on iPod 3rd gen.
2) Begin tests
3) examine console output
4) Continue until application crashes

Result:
Eventual application crash, potential for out of memory condition and warnings.

Expected result:
The animation completes without additional images being displayed

Notes:
While crashes were experienced with 1.7.2, these occurred quicker, and with slightly higher frequency.

   This issue links to the same problem mentioned in timob-5449 , the fix for it is already in master. This occurs as callback's KrollContext already left before the KrollCallback had time to unregister itself. </li>
