<h3>Description</h3>

  - name: convertPointToView
    description: translates a point from the receiver's view coordinate system to another view's coordinate system. If both views
      are connected in the native view heirarchies, will return the converted point in the form of an object with x and y properties.
      If either view is not in the view heirarchy, a null is returned. Keep in mind that views may be removed from the view heirarchy
      if their window is blurred or if the view is offscreen (such as in some situations with <Titanium.UI.ScrollableView>).
    returns:
        type: [Object, null]
    parameters:
      - name: point
        description: an object with properties of x and y describing a point within the receiver's coordinate system. If this argument is missing an x or y property, or the properties can not be converted into numbers, an exception will be raised.
        type: Object
      - name: destinationView
        description: the view whose coordinate system to which the point will be converted. If this argument is not a view, an exception will be raised.
        type: Titanium.UI.View

   To test this, simply run the "ui" test suite in Drillbit, and make sure the <code>convertPointToView</code> test passes.</li>
<li>Marshall Culpepper 2011-09-01

   Please ensure that the <code>ui</code> test passes for both iOS, and Android, and also run the KitchenSink test on Android, iOS simulator AND iOS device:
   * Base UI > Views > Point Conversion
   
   The iPhone Simulator has the 3rd "magenta" view click event disabled due the known exception bug.
   
   Also make sure to validate the TDoc APIs:
   <code><pre>
   $ ./apidoc/validate.py 
   </pre></code>
