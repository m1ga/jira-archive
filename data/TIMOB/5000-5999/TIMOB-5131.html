<h3>Description</h3>

Description:
While testing Kitchensink, Base UI>Views>Scroll Views>Scrollable View, I tapped the view which has two attached listeners. Neither the click event or the touchend event were logged. This works as expected on iOS.

Steps to reproduce:
1) Install KS 1.8.0 on Nexus S
2) Navigate to Base UI>Views>Scroll Views>Scrollable View
3) Tap on the view with the "Click me (View 2 - see log)" label
4) Examine the log

Result:
No event logged

Expected result:
The following is from iOS:
Fri Aug 26 11:46:53 unknown UIKitApplication:com.appcelerator.titanium[0x9940][1051] <Notice>: [INFO] ScrollView received click event, source = [object TiUIView]
Fri Aug 26 11:46:53 unknown UIKitApplication:com.appcelerator.titanium[0x9940][1051] <Notice>: [INFO] ScrollView received touchend event, source = [object TiUIView]

Notes:
Occurs with 1.7.2
Occurs with 1.6.2
