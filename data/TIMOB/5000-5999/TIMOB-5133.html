<h3>Description</h3>

Description:
While testing Phone>Geolocation, no Reverse Geo information is populated on screen. Knowing that iOS produces an alert in this situation, I examined the code to see if there were some iOS specific lines preventing this alert form appearing on Android, and there is no reason I could find that this would not have parity on Android. After running a few tests, I am still unable to get the alert to appear.

Steps to reproduce:
1) Install KS 1.8.0 on Nexus S
2) Navigate to Phone>Geolocation
3) Stand in a location with both a clear view of the sky and a nice wifi signal 
4) Wait for "Updated location field" to populate as this should trigger the reverse geo call


Result:
No reverse geo content, no alert.

Expected result:
Either reverse geo populates, or  "reverse geo error" alert.

Notes:
Also occurs with 1.7.2
