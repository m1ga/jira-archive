<h3>Description</h3>

Description:
While testing Phone>Orientation>, with the device in portrait mode, I clicked "set landscape". This sets the UI to landscape. Then I clicked "open window" and the UI rotated to portrait before the window opened. On iOS, the window opens, and the UI remains in landscape mode.

Steps to reproduce:
1) Install KS 1.8.0 on Nexus S
2) Navigate to Phone>Orientation>
3) With the device in portrait, click "Set landscape"
4) Click "open window"

Result:
The UI rotates to Portrait, then the window opens in portrait.

Expected result:
The UI remains in landscape and the window opens in landscape.

   This bug could be device specific. I get the above behavior on the Nexus S running V8 (1.8.0.1.v20111214093905). But, on the Droid 3 running Rhino (1.8.0.1.v20111214093905), "Set landscape" makes the UI stay in landscape after pressing "open window".</li>
