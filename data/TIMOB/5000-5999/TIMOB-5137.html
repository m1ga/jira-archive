<h3>Description</h3>

Description:
While testing Phone>Contacts>contact images, I chose a contact with images (Thanks Dawson) and the image appeared as expected. A second attempt to choose a contact with no image resulted in the text, "no image' appearing, but the previous image was present. See screenshot.

Steps to reproduce:
1) Install KS 1.8.0 on Nexus S
2) Navigate to Phone>Contacts>contact images
3) With the device in portrait, click "Set landscape"
4) Click "open window"

Result:
The UI rotates to Portrait, then the window opens in portrait.

Expected result:
The UI remains in landscape and the window opens in landscape.
