<h3>Description</h3>

We need to prevent information from being generated from some classes (such as TiColor) during the coverage generation process; these are proxies, but appear to be for internal use only, and as a result may be obsolete. We need to do the following:

* Evaluate Ti.Color as a standalone class and either:
** Blacklist it (not public knowledge)
** Document it (should be publicly available)

In the event that blacklisting all methods/properties from TiColor does not remove it from the coverage chart, we also need to update the blacklisting mechanism to handle the blacklisting of classes.
