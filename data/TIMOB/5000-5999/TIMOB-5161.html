<h3>Description</h3>

There's already a suite of tests for contacts on Android in drillbit, but we need tests on iOS which test full functionality. Because we can't rely on each device/sim having the same contacts information on it, we will need to test the full infrastructure, starting with createPerson/createGroup, setting properties, retrieving them, etc.

Any unit test will necessarily involve secondary verification that these were actually entered into the Contacts DB.

   Drillbit is no longer supported, this ticket is now irrelevant.</li>
