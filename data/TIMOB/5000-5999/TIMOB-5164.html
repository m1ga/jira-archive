<h3>Description</h3>

Currently, some submodules (and even modules?) are categorized as proxies in the generated iOS coverage. In particular, we need to ensure that the following are categorized as modules:

* Ti.App.Properties
* Ti.App.iOS
* Ti.Network.Socket

... Among many others. The entire coverage output should be skimmed and checked to make sure that proxies aren't duplicating module information, AND that those things which are submodules and iOS-only are being classified as modules.
