<h3>Description</h3>

When including Geolocation the generated manifest will have "<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_MOCK_LOCATION"/>.  This is fine for development but when submitting to the marketplace the Android Market says "MOCK LOCATION SOURCES FOR TESTING Create mock location sources for testing. Malicious applications can use this to override the location and/or status returned by real location sources such as GPS or Network providers."  Although it doesn't cause any functional issues, it's best to avoid this message.

   Fix for this is pending review. Once merged applications built for production should lack the mock location permission.</li>

   Added label: qe-testadded.</li>

   Tested with 1.9.0.v20120112153134 with v8/rhino</li>
