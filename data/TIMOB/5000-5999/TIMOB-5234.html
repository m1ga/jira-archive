<h3>Description</h3>

When launching the attached TiTest app, the splash screen momentarily appears as stretched in landscape mode and then quickly appears normally in landscape mode. This is not very noticeable in faster phones (though I was briefly able to see it on a Nexus S running 2.3.4), but can be better seen in slower phones such as the HTC Hero running 2.1 Update1.

A way I was able to reproduce this consistently was by letting the phone go to sleep and then activating it again. When I do this, the splash screen appears normally in portrait mode, then stretched in landscape mode, and then normally in landscape mode.
