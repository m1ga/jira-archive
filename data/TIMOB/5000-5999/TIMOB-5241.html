   As a side note, we need better/more logging classifications. The warning is FATAL to get attention: Despite the fact that the code can compensate for it, the FATAL is being used to indicate that something is seriously wrong.
   
   More specifically, we need two new classifications: Internal inconsistency failures due to flaws in Titanium and failures due flaws of the JS application (Such as using NaN or 1e500 as a dimension).</li>

   Update: This is a 1.8 issue only, and does not exist in 1_7_X (Namely, that error message didn't exist back then). Fortunately, this was due to a bit of confusion in that Alert hadn't anticipated the possibility that all its js objects would have been garbage collected, but despite the Fatal tag, this is a safe instance.</li>

   Make this warning happen in Debug builds only.</li>

   [Edit]: not relevant, I misread the current topic. Create a bug report specific to my problem.</li>

   Closing ticket as we no longer support this version of KS.</li>
