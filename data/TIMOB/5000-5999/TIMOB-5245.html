<h3>Description</h3>

Description:
While testing KitchenSink, Base UI>Views>Dashboard view, I entered the test in landscape mode and the dashboard had compressed icons and the layout was not correct. This could also occur when already in the test and rotating. The easier way to reproduce is to simply enter the test in landscape however. Rotating back to portrait does not fix the layout. See screen shot for more information.

Steps to reproduce:
1) Install KS 1.8.0 on device
2) Rotate device to Landscape orientation
3) Navigate to Base UI>Views>Dashboard view
4) Launch test

Result:
Poorly formatted screen items

Expected:
Icons and formatting look good, as they do in portrait.

Notes:
This does not occur in 1.7.2

   QE has said this issue persists; can be deferred to post-1.8 if necessary.</li>

   It's very likely we shouldn't even support dashboard in landscape orientation. Not designed for it. Might want to update the Three20 library too.</li>

   Closing as Fixed.
