<h3>Description</h3>

Description:
While testing KitchenSink, Platform>XHR>XML properties, I noted that the results for both responseText and responseXML were undefined despite the call being successful (200).

As far as I understand, a recent change to change some "null" returns to "undefined" may be the cause of this change. The "response text" for this call should be "null" if no error, or "text" if there was an error. 

Steps to reproduce:
1) Install KS 1.8.0 on device
2) Navigate to Platform>XHR>XML properties
3) Launch the test
4) Examine the ouput

Result:
both responseText and responseXML are undefined

Expected:
Both should be "null"

Notes:
Does not occur  in 1.7.2
