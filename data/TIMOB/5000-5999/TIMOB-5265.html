   In order to test this, create two separate Titanium applications (with different app ids, etc).
   
   In each, compare the value of Titanium.Platform.id and make sure that they are the exact same on both applications.
   
   Make sure that you test on both simulator and on device.
   
   Also, we need to test first on an application on iOS4, and then upgrade this same device to iOS5, and then re-run the same application.  The return value should be the same for the id.  This will test migrating of the id from iOS4 to iOS5.

   I researched a better way to generate a uniqueIdentifier last night and will integrate that to fix this issue.  This issue does not need to be addressed for the 1.7.3 build as the existing implementation is deprecated in iOS 5, not eliminated.  Removing 1_7_X label.</li>

   Verified in pull 517 that:
   iPod touch 4th gen 4(iOS 4.3.3), iPhone 4 ATT (iOS 5 GM seed), iPad 2 (iOS 5 GM Seed) all show unique identifiers.
   Verified on each that with 2 separate apps, the ID is the same.
   Verified iPad Simulator and iPhone simulator have the same ID for the two apps.</li>
