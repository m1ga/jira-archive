   The HDR and zooming controls are not exposed in Apple's APIs.  We will not be able to provide this functionality.</li>
<li>John V Pataki 2011-09-14

   The goal here for us at this time is to be able to use the standard controls already exposed by Titanium (top controls only), but also be able to use the custom overlay for the area at the bottom. The problem is that in Titanium it appears that trying to use both the standard controls plus an overlay doesn't work. The native controls cover up the area we need to add the overlay. A possible resolution here would be to allow us to place the overlay above the controls in the Z-direction (zIndex) so we can still use both. </li>

   In the attached overlayTest-1.js example, when you run this - the red box is not visible. This demonstrates the problem. We want to place things on the overlay in this bottom area of the screen but above the controls (in the z-direction) so we can place other buttons in that same area.</li>

   Closing ticket.</li>
