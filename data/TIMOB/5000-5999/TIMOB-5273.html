   The goal here for us at this time is to be able to use the standard controls already exposed by Titanium (top controls only), but also be able to use the custom overlay for the area at the bottom. The problem is that in Titanium it appears that trying to use both the standard controls plus an overlay doesn't work. The native controls cover up the area we need to add the overlay. A possible resolution here would be to allow us to place the overlay above the controls in the Z-direction (zIndex) so we can still use both.</li>
