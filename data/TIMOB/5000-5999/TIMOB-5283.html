   This was fixed a long time ago and I cannot reproduce using Titanium SDK master (currently 6.1.0). Not sure when exactly it was fixed, but you can create a project and use unicode characters in the name of project. The Titanium build system can handle the special characters in both file paths and in the contents of files. Both the iOS Simulator and Android emulator support them too.</li>
