   Email arrives in text/plain format with HTML stripped out</li>
<li>Tim Poulsen 2011-09-15

   Other HTML renders correctly in the email client on device, but is still stripped out in the received message</li>
<li>Pete Halatsis 2012-04-03

   Is there perhaps another way of doing an HTML email which IS working?</li>
<li>Sebastian Klaus 2014-11-05
