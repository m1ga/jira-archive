   These tests are actually the easiest way to duplicate the issue. See instructions on the ticket for testing.</li>

   OK. These are very intermittent problems, BUT can be consistently reproduced in exactly one way:
   
   - Synch Sabil's timob-4653 branch
   - Clean up all resources used by drillbit
   - Launch drillbit (drillbit.py --platforms=iphone)
   - Run ALL tests to completion (or until drillbit hangs)
   -- IF THE BUG PERSISTS: You will see the 'iPhone.UI.3DMatrixValue' test fail, with a message similar to the one in the description (probably "'Ti.UI.iOS.create3DMatrix' [undefined] is not an object")
   -- IF THE BUG IS FIXED: The test will pass! (or fail for some other reason)
   
   - Now, once drillbit is done (or crashed, hung, etc. and you've rebooted it) run the iPhone.UI.3DMatrixValue test ONLY.
   -- IF THE BUG PERSISTS: You will see the test fail in the manner described above
   -- IF THE BUG IS FIXED: The test will pass! (or fail for some other reason)
   
   *DO NOT LAUNCH ANY OTHER APPLICATIONS OR PERFORM ANY TASKS WHICH COULD POSSIBLY REALIGN ANYTHING IN RAM, OR ALTER PAGES, _INCLUDING PERFORMING OTHER DRILLBIT RUNS OF DIFFERENT TESTS AFTER THE INITIAL COMPLETE SUITE_ WHILE ATTEMPTING TO REPRODUCE THIS BUG. IT IS DEPENDENT UPON MEMORY ALIGNMENT. DOING SO MAY ALTER THE RESULTS SO THAT THE TEST 'PASSES', EVEN IF THE BUG PERSISTS.*</li>

   Drillbit runs and 3D matrix test passes.
