<h3>Description</h3>

The Previous, Next, and Done buttons on the keyboard toolbar don't honor the device language. E.g. change the device to German and the buttons still read "Previous" etc. Not sure if this is our implementation or if this is the underlying OS causing the issue. It was reported by one of our students.

   Thats is by nature correct behavior , it cannot be changed on a web view.</li>

   Sabil, can you provide a reference to back that up? Why wouldn't an OS-provided set of buttons change when the device language changes? Adding to this, on my iPad, these form buttons do change when I change the device's language setting. I don't think you should have closed this ticket.</li>

   If you a iPhone device with you, open up Safari go to any webpage online with textfields, click on it and try doing the same thing. YOu would see that the Keyboard Language changing not the next,previous and done buttons, they still remaining the same. Basically any webview is the same as safari on iphone. </li>

   Sabil, on both my iPad and iPod, the Next/Previous buttons change language when I change the device's language. I don't have an iPhone. Tested with Safari & the sign up form on the Appcelerator web page.</li>

   tim i tried it the same web site on on ipad 2 running ios 4.3 and still not changing for me. Please give more info about how you where able to see these changes and specs of the device.</li>

   Sabil, 
   
   Here's what I just tested -- using the attached Ti project built with 1.7.2 and installed to my iPad 2 running iOS 4.3. The project embeds a web form in a WebView. The Previous/Next buttons remain in English when the rest of the device is set to French (German, etc.). 
   
   I'm pretty sure I'm this is a Ti web view problem -- when opening a web page in Safari, loading the Appcelerator sign up page or any other page with a form, I bring up the keyboard and the Previous/Next buttons are translated.
   
   To change device language, open Settings, tap General, International, Language and choose another language then click Done.
   
   It's like we're not sending the language identifier to the embedded Safari client. I tried testing a few native apps, but all the ones I have on my iPad just open a Safari window rather than embedding something like a WebView.</li>

   This is happening because you have provided any folders for Localization to occur. iOS will only do localization if you provide the folders for localization . More info about this can be found on <a href="http://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides/Internationalizing+your+Application." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides/Internationalizing+your+Application.</a> 
   
   I am posting a modified version of the same app that you gave me, which provides localization for french and spanish.</li>
<li>Sabil Rahim 2011-10-17

   modified sample app with support for spanish and french</li>

   Sabil, I still don't get translated buttons with the Foo2 project in the simulator or on my iPad.</li>
