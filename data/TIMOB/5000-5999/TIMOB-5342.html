<h3>Description</h3>

Description:
While testing KS 172 on iOS 5, Base UI>Views>Table Views>Table View (layout 3), I manipulated the table rows by hitting the "plus" and "minus" icons and noted that the "plus" and "minus" icons were not being rendered correctly after the operation. It actually looks like they are scaled up and inside a square.

Steps to Reproduce:
1) Install KS with SDK 1.7.2 onto iOS 5 device
2) Navigate to Base UI>Views>Table Views>Table View (layout 3)
3) Tap the "plus" icon
4) On the same row, tap the "minus" icon
5) Optional: Tap the "plus" icon again to see the bad "minus" icon

Results:
The "plus" icon is now a rounded square with what looks like a scaled-up plus in it. If you followed optional step 5, you get a rounded square with what looks like a scaled-up minus in it.

Expected results:
No change in the appearance of the icons.

Note:
Does not occur with iOS 4.3x
DOES occur with SDK 1.8.0.v20110922105247

   Okay, this looks like something we can't fix sanely. This is a confluence of things, namely that the UIButton ignores the background image's scale property. Even when we do try to reset the background image. And as such, I'm tempted to call this an apple bug.
   
   Fortunately, there is a workaround. This happens ONLY on background images on buttons where the device is a retina display and the image does not have a retina version.
   
   Moral of the story: All iPhone/universal apps MUST have retina display images for button graphics.</li>
