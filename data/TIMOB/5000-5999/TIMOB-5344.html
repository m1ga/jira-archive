<h3>Description</h3>

Description:
While testing KS 172 on iOS 5, Base UI>Views>Coverflow view, I noticed a difference in the animation of the images as they moved from the sides to the center spot in the coverflow. The images on either side of the centered image have a gap between the image edge and the screen edge (in landscape mode). On iOS 4.3.x, the side images move to the center without much change in this gap. On iOS 5, the side image fills the gap between itself and the side of the screen, giving a less-than-smooth appearance to the animation.

Steps to Reproduce:
1) Install KS with SDK 1.7.2 onto iOS 5 device
2) Navigate to Base UI>Views>Coverflow view, any of them
3) Switch to device landscape mode
4) Watch the gap between the "on-deck" image and the side of the screen
5) Transition the "on-deck" image to the center location

Results:
The animation is not smooth and differs from the animation on 4.3.x.

Expected results:
Smooth animation that matches 4.3.x performance.

Note:
Does not occur with iOS 4.3x
OCCURS with SDK 1.8.0.v20110922105247

   Verified fixed with 1.7.X (1.7.3.v20111007133015) on iPhone 4 (ATT iOS 5.0). Leaving open until fix can be verified in 1.8.0.</li>
<li>Dustin Hyde 2011-12-12

   Re-verified fix with 1.7.X (1.7.6.v20111209013042) on iPhone 4.3.5 and 5.0.1.
   
   Bug still valid on:
   SDK: 1.8.0.v20111010114849
   Studio: 1.0.7.201112120322
   OS: OS X Lion
   Devices: iPhone 4.3.5 and 5.0.1.</li>

   This issue should be resolved as dupe and replaced with TIMOB-6574, which is the same issue with a different report.</li>
<li>Lee Morris 2017-05-23

   Closing ticket as invalid as there is a new version of Kitchen Sink and we no longer support the old version.</li>
