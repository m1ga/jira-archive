<h3>Description</h3>

Description:
While testing KS 172 on iOS 5, Base UI>Views>Dashboard view, I noticed a difference in the animation of the opening windows that appear when you click the icons on the dashboard view. On iOS 4.3.x, the windows open in a linear fashion. On iOS 5, the windows seem to open with a curved path.

Steps to Reproduce:
1) Install KS with SDK 1.7.2 onto iOS 5 device
2) Navigate to Base UI>Views>Dashboard view
3) Tap an icon in the lower part of the dashboard
4) Watch the path (the close button is a good reference) as the window opens

Results:
The animation of the window is on a curved path and differs from the animation on 4.3.x.

Expected results:
Smooth animation that matches 4.3.x.

Note:
Does not occur with iOS 4.3x
OCCURS with SDK 1.8.0.v20110922105247

   This might be an interaction between the layout manager we have and a difference between 4.3 and 5.0. After slowing down the animation for better inspection, it turns out that the curve and the path of the window does not change between the two. Instead, it's the positioning of the button that throws the eye off. In 4.3, it stays relative to the window center. In 5.0 it's relative to the top left of the window.</li>

   This issue is not critical for the 1.7.3 release, rescheduling for 1.8.</li>

   Closing ticket as Invalid as this version of Kitchen Sink is no longer supported.</li>
