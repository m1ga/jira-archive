<h3>Description</h3>

Description:
While running packaging test for 1.7.2 targeting iOS 5.0, I checked the version number of the packaged apps in iTunes (CMD-I) and noticed that instead of 1.0 as seen with iOS 4.3.x on Snow Leopard, the versions were unique numbers such as: 1.0.1316735639. This occurred with all the packaged apps. 

Steps to reproduce:
1) Package an application with Studio while having Xcode 4.2 active and targeting iOS 5
2) Share the application from the Xcode organizer archive.
3) Install on device by dragging to iTunes and syncing or by using Xcode to install
4) Check the version number in Xcode organizer under "applications" or in iTunes with CMD-I

Result:
Bundle ID appended to version number

Expected:
Version number alone

   In a Lion environment, The following has been verified.
   Xcode 4.2 + SDK 1.7.2 + Target iOS 5.0 = occurs
   Xcode 4.2 + SDK 1.8.0 + Target iOS 5.0 = Does not occur</li>

   Some additional info: When referring specifically to the verification of a packaged app in iTunes, I was able to reproduce the bundleID append everywhere I tried using 1.7.2. WHen packaging using 1.8.0, I could not reproduce the problem.
   
   Regardless of the iTunes info listed, it seems that the packaged apps in Xcode after installation on device are listed with the bundle ID. I'm not sure what to make of this one.</li>

   This is the expected behavior.  
   There are two bundle versions 
   -- 1. the short bundle version (1.0) and 
   -- 2. the Long bundle version (1.0.1234233344) .
   **This is fixed in 1.8.0 , till 1.7.2 we only used to have the long bundle version .</li>
