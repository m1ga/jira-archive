<h3>Description</h3>

Description:
While running packaging tests, the console reported a problem with access for assistive devices. I could not determine if this caused any problems, but was concerned since the process relies on this technology.

The error reported is:
[INFO] Compiling localization files
/Users/eric/Library/Application Support/Titanium/mobilesdk/osx/1.8.0pull486/iphone/xcode_organizer.scpt: execution error: System Events got an error: Access for assistive devices is disabled. (-1719)
[DEBUG] compiled ios file: /Users/eric/Documents/fromGit/titanium_mobile/demos/KitchenSink/build/iphone/build/Release-iphoneos/KitchenSink.app/en.lproj/Localizable.strings

Steps to reproduce:
1) Package an app for distribution
2) Watch console output during the build

Results:
Error appears in console

Expected:
No error logged

   Occurred with Lion on both Xcode 4.1 and 4.2. Occurred with 1.7.2 and 1.8.0 SDKs, and with both 5.0 and 4.3 iOS targets.</li>

   Screenshot showing the "Universal Access" control panel where you enable control for assistive devices.</li>

   Starting with Lion Apple is starting the process of sandboxing Mac OS X applications.  This will require us to provide certain entitlements to, for example, use Applescript events targeted at other applications.  Here is a link to a blog entry starting to discuss issues with Mac App sandboxing.  <a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/blog/2170/sandbox-corners." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.red-sweater.com/blog/2170/sandbox-corners.</a>  This will become an issue for our Desktop product as well as our tooling.</li>

   This is a Lion issue, not an iOS 5 issue.  Rescheduling and relabeling.</li>
<li>Reggie Seagraves 2011-10-14

   As this warning is benign, rescheduling for 1.9.</li>
<li>Reggie Seagraves 2011-10-14

   Workaround is to insure that "Enable access for assistive devices" is enabled in the "Universal Access" control panel.</li>

   I am having this exact issue with Studio 2.1.2 and TiSDK 2.1.2/2.1.1
   
   I've never seen it before, the workaround does not help. Now it just starts xcode and the 'Organizer - Devices' window, and stops there.
   
   
   I am missing a deadline because of this</li>

   This issue is out of date with our current supported SDK release (7.5.2.GA as of the date of closure), and out of date with mobile OS versions. 
   
   If community members feel that the issue is still valid, please create a new ticket. Please reference this closed ticket number, include SDK used, comments, and code that demonstrates/reproduces the issue.</li>
