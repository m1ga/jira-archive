<h3>Description</h3>

Developers would like an easier way to set username, domain and password for a HTTP request in Titanium.  If those three properties could be added to Titanium.Network.createHTTPClient it would make authentication much easier for app development.

   Moving to me and to TiAPI. This still needs example code and we need to know why the current system doesn't work.</li>

   OK, you can hit my SBS server to test this.  Please dont abuse my server...

   pass: our default IT new user password
   
   this will provide you with AD authentication to an IIS site.  let me know if this works for you.

   Can I champion this request to be moved up the list a bit. I have some corporate clients who need NTLM authentication for their internal proxy networks. This is a necessary feature set to support Enterprise apps.. I need it for iOS & Android asap, but I have been provided with a hack: <a href="https://gist.github.com/2312930" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://gist.github.com/2312930</a></li>

   @Mark - I have bumped up the priority. We would not be able to implement it for the upcoming release but we should be able to consider it for the next release.</li>

   Escalating this feature request for EMC Container app.</li>

   Hi TiMob10740 has been crossed out as a duplicate but nowhere on this jira do I see Android mentioned. NTLM authentication is my paramount concern. 
   
   As status is immediate will it be in the next release otherwise I will need to pay an Android dev to make a module for me.
   
   Needed so my app can work on a corporate wifi with NTLM authentication.
   
   Thanks.</li>
