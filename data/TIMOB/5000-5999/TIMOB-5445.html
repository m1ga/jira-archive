<h3>Description</h3>

Description:
While testing Kitchensink, Base UI>Views>Map View, I noticed the following in the console:
Oct  4 17:18:24 unknown UIKitApplication:com.eric.pushtest[0xb549][234] <Notice>: [DEBUG] loading: /var/mobile/Applications/A560C4C3-450C-4F4B-9DDE-16B14FF0A38F/KitchenSink.app/examples/map_view.js, resource: examples/map_view_js
Oct  4 17:18:25 unknown com.apple.locationd[28] <Notice>: Client com.eric.pushtest does not have appropriate entitlement to change prompt behaviour

I did not see this in the same KS on iOS 4.3.x
I did not see this in the same KS but built with 1.7.2

Steps to reproduce:
1) Install and launch KS
2) Navigate to Base UI>Views>Map View
3) Check console output

Result:
Console notice logged

Expected:
No unexpected console output

   am seeing this one on iOS5.0.1 / Ti 1.8.0 pre-RC1 with 3G connections. WiFi works as expected.</li>

   Tested iPad 1 iOS 5.0.1 and iPod 4GT iOS 4.3.5. Was able to reproduce the warning, but...
   
   * There is no functional difference between iOS 5.0.1 and iOS 4.3.5
   * I couldn't find any references which indicate the entitlement being referred to by locationd
   * We don't appear to use/enable entitlements anyway (?!?)
   
   It seems like this is a bug that should be marked WON'TFIX as a result. It can be revisited when a later iOS revision drops or there are necessary updates to entitlements.</li>

   Closing ticket as "Won't Fix".</li>
