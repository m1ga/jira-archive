<h3>Description</h3>

Description:
While testing KS, Base UI>Modal Windows, I Noted that the "flip horizontal" animation did not leave the view intact then animate by flipping to the purple modal window. Instead it changed the view to the purple modal window, then flipped to the purple modal window. This only occurred in iOS 5.0


Steps to reproduce:
1) Install KS on device
2) Navigate to Base UI>Modal Windows
3) set picker to "Flip horizontal"
4) Click "show modal"


Result:
The view window changes to the purple modal window before animating, then flips to the modal window

Expected:
The picker and button stay in view, then is flipped to the modal window.

Note:
Does not occur in iOS 4.3.x or with SDK 1.7.2.

   I can confirm this bug (using 1.8.2). It's possible to workaround by setting the opacity of the new window to 0, and then immediately after calling open animating the new window to an opacity of 1. But that's rather ugly and the results are somewhat timing dependent. Is there any way to fix this bug properly?</li>

   Resolving ticket as Invalid as there is now a new version of Kitchen Sink available and we no longer support the version which relates to this ticket.</li>
