<h3>Description</h3>

1. settings > General make sure your apps notification settings are for banner 
2. with an ti app running in the foreground (ks) push to it via urban airship. 

results: notification appears as a the blue modal one. In all other cases (app in the back ground, or app not launched but registered for push)

expected: I believe we should show only banner style when the user set to as such

   as per Blain, in app is done via js and alert - hence as expected</li>
