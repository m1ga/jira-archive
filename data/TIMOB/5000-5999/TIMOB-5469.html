<h3>Description</h3>

We currently store app data under the /mnt/sdcard/<appid>.  This does not get removed when the app is deleted. We may want to move it to where getExternalFilesDir() is located, since that should be removed along with the app.  We can't use getExternalFilesDir() since it's only available API level 8+.

   Cannot reproduce. Just tested it with an app built with Titanium SDK master (currently 6.1.0) and an Android 6.0 (API 23) emulator and once the app was installed, the app data was actually written to <code>/mnt/sdcard/Android/data/&lt;appid&gt;</code>, not <code>/mnt/sdcard/&lt;appid&gt;</code>. Furthermore, when uninstalling the app, the <code>/mnt/sdcard/Android/data/&lt;appid&gt;</code> was removed as expected.</li>
