<h3>Description</h3>

This is an update to the current two-tab default project that better adheres to current best practices. Note that this has a due date perhaps different than M2 if we want to get it in as part of the 1.8 release.

   Hi Don--trying to indicate that we want to update the current two-tab default content, and it ideally would go in as part of 1.8. What's the best process for doing that?</li>
<li>Kevin Whinnery 2011-10-10

   I have bandwidth/resources to help with this - at least to provide the alternate content.</li>
<li>Don Thorp 2011-10-10

   The best way is to fork and generate the new content as a pull request. We'll review it and get it in.</li>
<li>Neeraj Gupta 2011-12-28

   Is this "New Feature" request still valid given that we have new templates and samples available for review now?</li>
<li>Ingo Muschenetz 2011-12-28

   It might be. I think the default basic project included with the SDK might still have content which could be stripped out. Kevin W. would be the best judge of that.</li>

   no longer relevant</li>
