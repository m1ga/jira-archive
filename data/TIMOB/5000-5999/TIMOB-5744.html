<h3>Description</h3>

As noticed in this thread:

<a href="http://developer.appcelerator.com/question/126708/respond-to-a-button-in-a-table-row-without-triggering-table-row-click" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://developer.appcelerator.com/question/126708/respond-to-a-button-in-a-table-row-without-triggering-table-row-click</a>

Titanium component's "toString" method does not provide identical string on different platforms.


For example:

<code><pre>
var button = Ti.UI.createButton();
Ti.API.debug(button.toString());
</pre></code>

on Android it produces: [Ti.UI.Button]
while on iOS it produces: [object TiUIButton]


IMHO, it would be nice if "toString" method would be standardized for all Titanium components, "[object TiComponentName]" seems OK choice to me.

   Same results in SDK 1.7.2</li>
<li>Ivan Skugor 2011-12-20

   This seems to be fixed in 1.8.0.1 SDK, I haven't verified on iOS, but "v8" got this right, also "JSON.stringify" now works as it should.</li>
<li>Paul Dowsett 2011-12-21

   Reporter has indicated that this is fixed. Just needs to be tested on both platforms.</li>
<li>Karl Åström 2012-01-20

   Actually now toString returns [object View] on v8 and [object TiUIView] on ios so it's not consistent. I would express a preference for the iOS version since it makes it possible to construct a general matcher for Ti-components as noted above. 
   
   If i could make a really bold request I'd like for titanium to implement its components so that Object.prototype.toString returns good values on iOS as specified in ecma-262 5th ed section 15.2.4.2
   Currently it returns [object Object] for all Ti-components on iOS which is less useful.</li>
<li>Ivan Skugor 2012-01-23

   Yeah Karl, you're right, I missed to notice that and I agree "[object TiUIView]" is good naming convention.</li>
<li>Karl Åström 2012-02-07

   Also, as i found out while hunting a particularly annoying bug today, if you have an id property in your view you get neither of these but instead something based on the id like so: Ti.UI.createView({id:'fooBar'}).toString() == '[object fooBar]' </li>
<li>Josh Roesslein 2013-02-01

   We may want to discuss if overriding toString() is a good practice.
   It may be better to introduce a property on proxies for getting the type name.
   
   Ex: var view = Ti.UI.createView(); view.name === 'Ti.UI.View';</li>

<li>Rene Pot 2020-02-14

   we have <code>apiName</code> property for this.</li>
