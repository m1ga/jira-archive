<h3>Description</h3>

Description:
While testing Kitchensink, Base UI>Views>Table Views>Dynamic Scrolling, I scrolled down a few times to add about 50 rows to the tableView. I scrolled and then tapped "back" while the view was still scrolling. KS then crashed, please see attached report.  I attempted to reproduce and was able to 1/10 attempts. This log is also attached. I tried to reproduce on an iPhone 4 verizon (4.2.10) running KS built with 1.7.2 and was unable to reproduce in 10 attempts.

Console output was:
Oct 13 12:50:03 unknown UIKitApplication:com.appcelerator.pushtest[0xad9d][415] <Notice>: [DEBUG] loading: /var/mobile/Applications/E9184D5F-1445-488B-B8C9-DE9088FE0036/KitchenSink.app/examples/table_view_dynamic_scroll.js, resource: examples/table_view_dynamic_scroll_js

3) Scroll down a few times to populate the tableview to ~ 50 rows
4) Flick to scroll up, and while scrolling:
5) Tap "back"

Result:

Expected results:
No crash, testing continues as planned

   This is a preexisting issue from 1.7.2 already fixed in 1.8.  Labeling as tbs-1.7.4.  Will be cherry-picked from master.</li>
<li>Reggie Seagraves 2011-10-18

   I think this has been fixed in 1.8 already.  Changes were significant enough to inhibit cherry picking for 1_7_X.</li>
<li>Reggie Seagraves 2011-10-19

   Validate against 1.8.</li>
<li>Eric Merriman  2011-11-11

   Unable to reproduce with SDK 1.8.0.1.v20111111081456 in ten attempts on each of the following: iPad 1 (4.3.5), iPhone 4s (5.0), iPod touch 4th gen (5.0)</li>
