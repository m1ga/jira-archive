<h3>Description</h3>

Attached is a basic example showing the issue:

Windows opened in a navgroup do not get GC'd despite attempts to null out the window after it's closed in the navgroup.  In the example I'm using a commonJS module to add to the new window, open it, etc.  Even nulling out 'exports' yields no results.

NOTE:  If you hit the auto generated back button - the window DOES get GC'd.  Only if you close it programmatically does it retain the windows.

Here is a video example - first click on the auto generated buttons, which do release - then clicking the button to programmatically close it, which never releases:  <a href="http://screencast.com/t/MtzkI4ZRhn" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://screencast.com/t/MtzkI4ZRhn</a>

   The only thing I can figure is there is some voodoo going on in the background with the auto generated back button and close that doesn't apply to programmatically closing it.
   
   I thought maybe the CommonJS module was being retained but after a few tests, I'm sure it's not the COmmonJS module getting retained (quick test is to create a bunch of TiUI objects in the module but don't add it to the window...they all get GC'd - however if you add them to the window they will, of course, stay around since the window is staying around).</li>

   Ok just converted the test to a non commonJS example since that doesn't work on 1.8 right now - <a href="http://pastie.org/2714222" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://pastie.org/2714222</a>
   
   Results:
   1.7.X - Does not release windows (just like CommonJS example)
   1.8.0 - Releases memory appropriately.</li>
