Question asked to the community: <a href="http://developer.appcelerator.com/question/126808/ios-5-stacked-views-does-not-scroll-anymore-using-back" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://developer.appcelerator.com/question/126808/ios-5-stacked-views-does-not-scroll-anymore-using-back</a>

Code example (paste it into a new application app.js and run):

<code><pre> 

var tabGroup = Titanium.UI.createTabGroup({});

var win1 = Titanium.UI.createWindow({  
    title:'Window 1',
    backgroundColor:'#fff'
});
var tab1 = Titanium.UI.createTab({
    title:'Tab 1',
    window:win1
});

var label1 = Titanium.UI.createLabel({
	color:'#999',
	text:'I am Window 1',
	font:{fontSize:20,fontFamily:'Helvetica Neue'},
	textAlign:'center',
	width:'auto'
});

win1.add(label1);

var win2 = Titanium.UI.createWindow({  
        title:'Window 2',
        backgroundColor:'red'
});

var label2 = Titanium.UI.createLabel({
    color:'#fff',
    text:'I am Window 2, if you click to go back, animation will not work on iOS5 devices. Only the title will scroll back, the rest of the page will automatically appear.',
    font:{fontSize:20,fontFamily:'Helvetica Neue'},
    textAlign:'center',
    width:'auto'
});

win2.add(label2);
    
win1.addEventListener('click', function(e) {
    tab1.open(win2);
});

tabGroup.addTab(tab1);  
tabGroup.open();

</pre></code>

   I'm sorry, it's my first time submitting a bug.
   
   How do i reopen it in order to add the missing info ?

   I'm sorry, Sylvain, I think Matt inadvertently closed rather than resolved the ticket.
   
   I am not sure whether you will see an "edit" button when a ticket is resolved, so you may need to reopen it before you can amend it.
   
   Thanks in advance</li>
<li>Sylvain Simard 2011-10-17

   I updated the missing infos, it is hopefully complete now, i just dont know how to reopen it.
   
   Sorry about that, i should be better next time ;-)

   Btw I had same issue with 4.2 released apps on an IOS5 device, this seems to be is fixed in 1.8.x </li>
<li>Reggie Seagraves 2011-11-16

   This was apparently fixed by a previous checkin.</li>

   Closing issue due to not being able to reproduce
   
   Tested with Ti Studio 1.0.8.201201101928
   Ti Mob SDK 1.8.0.1
   OSX Lion
   iPod Touch OS 4.3.3, iPad 2 OS 5.0.1</li>

    I can confirm that I'm having this issue as well. Albeit in a more complex application. I've tested a fair bit myself and stumbled across this which mimics my issue perfect. I've cut 'n' pasted the code and it runs fine in the emulator but behaves erroneously on my 5.0.1 3GS.
    
    I've got:
    OS X 10.6.8
    ---8<---
    XCode 3.2.6 (64bit)
    Component versions
    Xcode IDE: 1761.0
    Xcode Core: 1809.0
    ToolSupport: 1806.0
    SDKs:
      Mac OS X:
      10.5:	(9L31a)
      10.6:	(10M2518)
      iPhone OS:
      4.3:	(8F191m)
      iPhone Simulator:
      3.2:	(7W367a)
      4.0:	(8A400)
      4.1:	(8B117)
      4.2:	(8C134)

    MobileSDK 1.8.0.1 (as far as I can tell)</li>
<li>Daniel Gustafsson 2012-02-17

    I can confirm that this is still present when compiling for 1.8.1 SDK.
    
    Mind you, the bug disappeared for a while and then re-appeared in our main app. I'm afraid I can't pinpoint exactly what changes in the code caused the change in behavior. It's most likely some weird voodoo combined with XCode version and the project files that Titanium spits out.
    
    However I can easily reproduce this with the example given in the report, could we please get an update on this? I'll provide any information that I can, except for our project of course.</li>
