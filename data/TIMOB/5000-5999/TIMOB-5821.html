<h3>Description</h3>

Description:
While setting up our new QE team members, we encountered a problem with scons failing. After speaking with Don, this is caused by the naming convention used for new installations for the API 7 folder in <android_sdk>/add-ons. Details of the console output are:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/local/bin/scons", line 5, in <module>
    pkg_resources.run_script('scons==2.1.0', 'scons')
  File "/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Extras/lib/python/pkg_resources.py", line 489, in run_script
    self.require(requires)[0].run_script(script_name, ns)
  File "/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Extras/lib/python/pkg_resources.py", line 1207, in run_script
    execfile(script_filename, namespace, namespace)
  File "/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/scons-2.1.0-py2.7.egg/EGG-INFO/scripts/scons", line 187, in <module>
    import SCons.Script
ImportError: No module named SCons.Script

Steps to reproduce:
1) Perform a clean installation of the Android SDK API 14
2) In terminal go to your titanium_mobile GIT repository
3) try to scons

Result:
scons fails with console error as listed above

Expected:
scons completes successfully

   This error looks like a SCons installation issue, is there something else related to Android r14 that you were seeing?</li>
<li>Bill Dawson 2011-10-29

   I have r15 (it just came out) and cannot reproduce this on OSX *10.6.8*.
   
   Is this still reproducible?  The error message looks more like a scons configuration problem than anything to do with Android tools revisions.</li>

   We will check if this is still reproducible. The issue was with new installations only. If you previously had the SDK installed, the update would work fine. If you didn't, the fresh install would fail. w</li>

   Need QE to verify if issue is still valid</li>
<li>Bill Dawson 2012-03-06

   believed to be no longer relevant.</li>
<li>Lee Morris 2017-03-07

   Closing ticket as the issue cannot be reproduced.</li>
