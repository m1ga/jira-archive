   Cannot reproduce the problem in 2.2, neither in Emulator or with my HTC Desire which runs 2.2.  They work fine for me.
   
   2.1 Emulator crashes as described.  I don't understand the connection to OAuth, however.  How is this related to OAuth?!?
   
   Anyway, I'm looking at the 2.1 crash.</li>

   TiStudio 1.0.6.201110251616, SDK 1.7.4.v20111025165811
   
   Reproduced on hero 2.1 
   
   see attached crash log</li>

   Those look like the errors that occur when trying to recover from a crash. Doesn't your logcat also contain a "dump" that includes a bunch of hex addresses, and references to things like "libskia" and "libwebcore" (or something like that)?</li>

   2.2 problem was not reproducible either by me or QE.
   
   2.1 crash is still easily reproducible.  It is not a Titanium issue and therefore will not be fixed.  The html/css/js (i.e., the content) that Facebook serves up to the Android WebView for the feed dialog apparently causes the WebKit browser (or perhaps Skia) to crash in Android 2.1.
   
   Facebook could change this content at any time, so it could be that the crash goes away.
   
   To reinforce the argument that this is not a Titanium issue, note that the exact crash can easily be reproduced in a native (non-Titanium) Android application.  The attached fb_native.zip file has such a native application which will show the crash when run.  (If you want to run it, you will find the .apk in the bin/ folder inside the zip.)</li>
