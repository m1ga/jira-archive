   Saw Natalie reproduce the error, but have been unable to reproduce it on a system which uses "official" toolchain elements (SDK 1.7.4.9e633fb, OS 10.6.8, Studio 1.0.6.201110202348, XCode 4.2.4C199 / iOS 5.0 SDK). Apparently the bug was reported against XCode 4.1, and persisted when the SDK was still selected as 4.3, but disappeared when it was swapped to 5.0. Probably means that a toolchain we don't support (XCode 4.1/SDK 4.3) was being invoked. Going to confirm this before marking the bug invalid/can't reproduce.</li>

   Unable to reproduce with the official toolchain set (as per previous comment). If it can be reproduced on a machine with a clean xcode 4.2 install (and no other xcode installs) then this bug should be reopened.</li>

   Uninstalled all the xcode off my machine and installed 4.2 only and not encountering the issue anymore</li>
