<h3>Description</h3>

Description:
I was trying to determine the behavior of the android devices when held in landscape while launching an app. I was unable to get the faster devices to display any splash in landscape. This differs from the behavior while launching in portrait mode. I was able on subsequent launches to get the slower devices to flash a red splash, but it looks like the portrait one stretched. The sample code generated by Studio for a mobile android project contains 11 images for various resolutions. I was trying to determine which is used in landscape for various devices.

I was unable to capture a screenshot since the splash when displayed is only there for a split second.

Steps to reproduce:
1) Create a new Ti Mobile project in studio
2) Examine the folder structure to verify the various images at resources/android/images/res*
3) Install on device
4) Rotate to landscape orientation
5) Launch app

Result:
Splash screen not displayed on first launch

Expected:
Splash screen displayed

   Is there a workaround for this issue?  Specifically, I would like a tolerable, (not stretched/squished) non-trivial (needs to have at least a logo) splash screen that displays in both landscape and portrait mode using titanium 1.6.2.  Any information you have to achieve this would be appreciated.  Pointing me to the file that I might modify/extend in the source would be sufficient.</li>

   Still seeing this issue:
   
   SDKs tested: 2.1.2.GA, 2.1.3.v20120927181611, 3.0.0.v20121002103353
   
   Devices tested: Galaxy Nexus 4.0.4, Droid (original) 2.2.3</li>

   Watching as this will affect a project we finish up next week for distro</li>

   I'll launch my app this weekend with this bug, but a fix would be great for an soon to come update. Thnx.</li>

   Same thing with 2.1.2GA, 2.1.3.GA on Samsung Galaxy S2 and also on Galaxy Tab.</li>

   Why has nothing happened on this issue for 18 months? 
   
   I see this issue -- my landscape splash images don't show up.  No stretched portrait images (which would be even worse); just no splash at all.
   
   Just to rule out my code, I created a new Single Window Application (Classic) using SDK 3.1.0 GA, and with no modifications, it exhibits the same behavior.
   
   I'm running on a Samsung Epic 4G.  Not a super fast android device by today's standards.
   
   It's not the end of the world that the splash doesn't show up (although it's one of those "fit and finish" things that make the difference between an amateurish app and a professional one).
   
   The main reason I find this important is that I'm putting a lot into maintaining splash graphics, and we're packaging at least 4 landscape splash images that never get used.  That's a lot of wasted space.</li>

   This issue also occurs in native Android apps.
   The splash screen / root activity is not displayed because the window/tabgroup activity loads too fast. If I delay opening the window:
   <code><pre>
   var win = Ti.UI.createWindow({
   	backgroundColor: "white",
   	exitOnClose: false
   });
   
   setTimeout(function(){
   	win.open();
   }, 500);
   </pre></code>
   I can see the splash screen displaying correctly in both portrait and landscape modes.
