<h3>Description</h3>

Description:
While testing pull 582 across all iOS devices, the iPhone 4s showed a gap at the control tab when the app loaded. This did not occur on any other device we tested (all of them in our inventory)including other iOS 5.0 devices.

Steps to repro:
1) Install KS 1.7.x built with SDK 1.7.4.v20111021181815+ (the next build should have the pull code)
2) Hold device in landscape
3) Launch KS

Result:
See screenshot. There is a gap at the top of the screen, between the nab and status bars.

Expected:
No gap
