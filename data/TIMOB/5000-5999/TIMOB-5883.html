<h3>Description</h3>

The picker should be able to emit "click" events. This is seen for example in Facebook's app if you press the All Stories button, where the user closes the picker window by clicking an item in the picker. To do that, the picker should fire not only change events, but also click events.

   If I remember correctly, "click" event can't be added or triggered by picker rows, so that functionality could be useful.</li>
<li>Sergej Kotliar 2011-10-26

   As mentioned, many apps have this functionality, so it has to be there somewhere in the OS level. There's quite a few QA threads asking for this to work and discussing workarounds (none of them good). 
   
   If it's the row of the picker that fires the events is less important as long as something triggers an event that indicates that the user is done picking. </li>
<li>Ivan Skugor 2011-10-26

   Couldn't that be achieved with "change" event?
   
   But nevertheless, I think "click" event could be useful in some cases.</li>
<li>Sergej Kotliar 2011-10-26

   Change event fires every time the scrolling stops. It often takes many scrolls to get to the right option. Try it in your facebook app and you'll see.</li>

   Sergej,
   
   Is this request for click events on the picker? or the row? please update accordingly and I will accept this request.
   
   Thanks,
   Matt</li>

   Not sure which it should be. I'd settle for any of these. But my feeling is it's on the picker. Whatever the OS provides. </li>
<li>Ivan Skugor 2011-10-26

   Could be useful for both (like for table view and for table view row). :)</li>
<li>Sergej Kotliar 2011-10-27

   So, priority low and not assigned to a sprint, means "not going to get fixed in any foreseeable future"?
   
   I'd argue this is a bug rather than a feature, since Picker is one of the UI elements advertised as supported, and this is one of the features needed for it to work in a real-world scenario...</li>

   It won't be added in the 1.8 timeframe for sure and will be re-evaluated as we go through tickets for 1.9. </li>

    Shawn: One thing to keep in mind is that Pickers on Mobile Web do not scroll, so anything that uses scroll as a basis won't be supported on Mobile Web. I would recommend thinking about it a little more abstractly. What does a scroll represent? What information is useful in a scroll? How much of this is tied to the scrolling specifically, and how much to the general change in state? I think we can come up with something more generic.</li>
<li>Shawn Lipscomb 2012-03-29

    I can live without the scroll events (what I really need is the 'click' event as described in my item #1).  I just thought that since 'change' is fired when the list is scrolled, that the name of the event wasn't descriptive of what was really occurring.</li>
<li>Bryan Hughes 2012-03-29

    We could call 1) something like "beforechange", since "click" still implies a type of action that describes the interface, not the underlying meaning of the action, and so may not apply to all platforms current or future.
    
    I'm not saying we need to get rid of the scroll events, just that the name "scroll" isn't properly descriptive since it assumes an interface that isn't necessarily present.
    
    EDIT: Just had a thought: I don't know if this helps you or not, but Mobile Web already fires a click/singletap event for pickers.</li>

    We have addressed this for Android as part of TIMOB-8426, but as part of iOS 7 changes, we may not be able to address it for iOS.</li>
