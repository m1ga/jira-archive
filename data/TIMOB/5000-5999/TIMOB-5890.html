<h3>Description</h3>

Steps To Reproduce:
1. Run test case 1000 from <a href="http://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/tp/Analytics+Test+Plan" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/tp/Analytics+Test+Plan</a>

Actual Result:
{"id":"a91452a9-dbe3-4725-abbf-fa0acc0a5fa7:62aa69827255df19","sid":"fc6d2a62-5bcd-4b00-b158-3f036d9f6fb7","ts":"2011-10-27T21:22:20.767-0800","event":"ti.enroll"

Expected Result:
To either display local time with offset: 2011-10-27 15:37:55-07:00
Or
UTC time with no offset: 2011-10-27T22:23:44.162+0000

Note:
If we decide on local time with offset, we need to put a parity bug for iOS to fix, as they are currently using UTC time with no offset

   The correct behavior is explained in RFC-3339.
   
   In Linux you can use: 
   
   % date --rfc-3339=seconds
   2011-10-28 11:03:04-07:00
   
   Note that 11:03:04-07:00 is equivalent to 18:03:04-00:00 and 14:03:04-04:00. Any of these options are fine for the timestamp.
   
   iPhone appears to always send the UTC time with offset 00:00, which is one of the correct behaviors.
   
   Android appears to send UTC time with an offset that is *not* always 00:00. It needs to either send UTC with offset 00:00, or send a local time with the offset of the local time zone.
   
   I'm attaching a few seconds of production analytics logs from Android devices. Look at "ts:" below to see the variation in timestamps. Note that these are consecutive events received within the a few seconds.
   
   2011-10-28T18:20:45.287-0500  // incorrect. Should be 18:20:45.287-0000 or 13:20:45.287-0500
   2011-10-28T18:20:19.248+0000  // correct
   2011-10-28T18:20:19.248+0000  // correct
   2011-10-28T18:20:33.552-0500  // incorrect
   ...
   2011-10-28T18:25:03.634+0100  // incorrect
   ...
   2011-10-28T18:21:02.928+0000  // correct
