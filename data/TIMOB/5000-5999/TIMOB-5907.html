<h3>Description</h3>

Let say you need some advanced styling for your content, so you decide to use a webView. The downside with this besides the high memory use, is that the webView has shadows on the top when you drag your content down, so it's obvious that it's an webView.

There should be a way to disable this shadow. Like an property on webView called <code>webView.shadow = false</code>.

   I found this in Q&A and it seems to work: <a href="http://developer.appcelerator.com/question/118810/how-to-disable-scrolling-and-shadows-in-a-webview#answer-233259" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://developer.appcelerator.com/question/118810/how-to-disable-scrolling-and-shadows-in-a-webview#answer-233259</a>
   
   It would be nice if it was included in the SDK though.</li>

   This is an important feature to help people to create native looking web apps. Without this you can't really use the webView without it being obvious that it's a webView...
   
   There's an easy 3-liner fix linked to from the issue.
   
   I've been waiting for this one for a long time.
   
   Hopefully someone can take a look at this.

   Still present...Please just add the following code to the core (TiUIWebView.m):
   
   -(void)setHideShadow_:(id)arg
   {
       for(UIView *wview in [[[webview subviews] objectAtIndex:0] subviews])
       {
           if([wview isKindOfClass:[UIImageView class]])
           {
               wview.hidden = [TiUtils boolValue:arg];
           }
       }
   }</li>

   can we just make this a PR already? Hans already pasted the code to do this.</li>
<li>Rene Pot 2020-02-14

   This is not an issue anymore. Probably since iOS 7 or otherwise a PR fixed it in the meantime.</li>
