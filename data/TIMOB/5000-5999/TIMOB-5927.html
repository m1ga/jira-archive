   I've tested with your snippet and am able to reproduce it I'm getting the following results:
   
   File on their server:
   
   On Mac:
   ~1000ms (very small file, gzip makes little difference.)
   
   On DroidX (wifi)
   ~11000ms
   
    
   I also tested by putting URL to my phone's browser, and it takes roughly the same amount of time to process. It would seem that the handshaking is most time-intensive when connecting to ssl server.</li>
<li>process 2012-06-18

   same on Titanium mobile sdk 1.8.2</li>
<li>process 2012-06-18

   ... and android 3.1</li>

   I've tried this on both Android and iOS emulators.  Using shak's test case, the first request without GZIP always takes a little longer (up to 1300ms for android and 850ms for iOS).  However, all subsequent request take around 300ms on both platforms.  When trying to GZIP, the request takes ~200ms on android and ~300ms on iOS.
   
   The difference isn't a 24x difference as mentioned in the bug.  Going to mark this as cannot reproduce until we get a better test case.</li>
