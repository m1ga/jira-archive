<h3>Description</h3>

With the 1.7.4 release that went out today, if you create a new project through TiStudio, and launch it unmodified, it will crash with no feedback after about a minute.  Reported by the community, verified by me on my 10.6 box running Xcode 4.1.  Reported by community member on Xcode 4.1 and 4.2 after an upgrade.  Will update with more data as we have it.

Steps To Reproduce:
1. Launch Studio and create a new project to use 1.7.4
2. Launch application in simulator
3. Let simulator sit for 2-3 minute

Actual:
Simulator exits

Expected:
Simulator should not exit

   When it crashes, it reports this:
   
   
   [DEBUG] Session did end with error Error Domain=DTiPhoneSimulatorErrorDomain Code=1 "The simulated application quit." UserInfo=0x100130e00 {NSLocalizedDescription=The simulated application quit., DTiPhoneSimulatorUnderlyingErrorCodeKey=-1}

   There appears to be a correlation with analytics.  On my environment, the app only crashes when the analytics property is set to true in tiapp.xml - I've tried it with both settings, and only analytics set to true in tiapp.xml will produce the crash.</li>
