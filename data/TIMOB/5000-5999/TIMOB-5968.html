<h3>Description</h3>

1) Launch QTS
2) Navigate to test 4748
3) Click start

Results: Text is not aligning properly in text field.  See attached screenshots

Notes:
This is a regression.  It works fine in 1.7.5.
If all the other tests in QTS are commented out in aTestList.js, then it works as expected.
Assigning to myself for now, pending further investigation.

   Can't reproduce. Bouncing back to Alan to retest. Testing with 070df91f8f432765c0a7d8cb114e5cd87445c51e</li>

   Marking as cannot reproduce, until we can recreate it consistently. As per Alan:
   
   That bug is really weird.  I originally assigned it to myself because QE didn't want anyone from iOS spending time looking into it until we had clear reproducible steps.
   
   It has to do with our internal test app QTS. One of our tests seems to have a messed of text field, but if we take out all the other tests, it works fine.  We couldn't really find a root cause as of yet.  Do you need to bug closed?  If it can be open for now, hopefully QE can look into it more.</li>
