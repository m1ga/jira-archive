<h3>Description</h3>

Description:
While testing KS iPad on an iPad 2 (iOS 4.3.5) I noted that if the device is rotated on the "Split View-Plain" test and then a modal window is displayed, the main UI is rotated from landscape to portrait and then the next modal window is animated from the left side instead of from the bottom of the display. In addition, the main UI rotates back from portrait to landscape poorly (status bar disconnected and slow to animate, master window redraws over itself). 1.7.2 SDK behaves differently, please see note below.

See attachments for details.

Steps to reproduce:
1) Install KS iPad (1.8.0 branch) on iPad 2
2) While device is in portrait select "split view plain", note UI rotates to landscape
3) Select "show modal", note window opens animating from the bottom of the screen
4) Dismiss modal, noting that the main UI was rotated to portrait behind the modal then rotates poorly back to landscape
5) Rotate device to landscape and select "show modal" again, noting that the modal animates in from the left
6) Dismiss the modal and select "show modal" again. Note the modal animates in from the bottom

Results:
Main UI window rotates behind modal, rotates back with poor animation, and the first modal window after this process animates in from the left.

Expected:
Main UI stays in landscape, rotates if needed with components in unison, and modal always animates from the bottom.

Note: Also occurs with KS iPad 1.7.2, although not initially. KS iPad 1.7.2 on this test rotates the initial UI clockwise, where 1.8.0 rotates counter-clockwise. 1.7.2 has solid animation in that state but does display the modal animating in from the side (opposite in this case). When 1.7.2 is forced to the same landscape as the 1.8.0 default, the animation is poor. 1.8.0 shows poor animation in either landscape orientation.
