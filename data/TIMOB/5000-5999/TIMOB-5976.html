<h3>Description</h3>

Description:
Base UI>Views>Events Propagation normally reports clicks on the window, the views, and the labels within the views. With my latest run on KS using 1.8.0, clicks on the labels are not reported.

Steps to reproduce:
1) Install KS on iPad 2
2) Navigate to Base UI>Views>Events Propagation
3) Click on any of the labels ("A", "B", "C", or "D")

Result:
The label clicks are not reported at the bottom of the screen

Note:
DOES NOT occur with 1.7.5

   This is an invalid bug, but a test update makes it clearer; this bug will remained open until the pull request for the test is processed, at which point it should likely be resolved as _INVALID_.
   
   This is an understandable mistake though, since the label which tracks the view propagation is updated twice in rapid succession: First with the label name, then with the view name (both events are hit, which indicates they are propagating correctly). This means that you only ever see the label display the text from the second update (view name).</li>

   Tested and verified fixed. Event propagation does report label click.
