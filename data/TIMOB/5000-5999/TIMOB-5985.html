<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Feature description</h4>
Ability to use the CLLocationManager class and their methods. It will help building the location applications (like geofencing). 

The CLLocationManager class description: <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/CoreLocation/Reference/CLLocationManager_Class/CLLocationManager/CLLocationManager.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/CoreLocation/Reference/CLLocationManager_Class/CLLocationManager/CLLocationManager.html</a>

Expected behavior:
If you start this service and your application is subsequently terminated, the system automatically relaunches the application into the background if a new event arrives. In such a case, the options dictionary passed to the application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: method of your application delegate contains the key UIApplicationLaunchOptionsLocationKey to indicate that your application was launched because of a location event. Upon relaunch, you must still configure a location manager object and call this method to continue receiving location events. When you restart location services, the current event is delivered to your delegate immediately. In addition, the location property of your location manager object is populated with the most recent location object even before you start location services.

   And a must-read on the subject: <a href="http://stevenou.com/post/17623116547/how-to-hack-geofencing-into-titanium" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://stevenou.com/post/17623116547/how-to-hack-geofencing-into-titanium</a>
   
   This code from Steven Ou can be used as a start point for this matter.
   
   I think geofencing is an old feature on iOS and could be easily mapped on the already working Titanium Geolocation module.

   You might want to check out this module <a href="https://github.com/benbahrenburg/benCoding.BasicGeo" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/benbahrenburg/benCoding.BasicGeo</a> it has many of the CCLocationManager functions you mentioned.
   
   Kevin has requested I submit a pull request, just trying to find the time to put everything together. So hopefully in the next couple of weeks will have it submitted.</li>

   Any news on this one?
   
   Can we merge Ben's code? (at least the startMonitoringSignificantLocationChanges part?)
   
   Also for complete Geofencing support we would need the startMonitoringForRegion / stopMonitoringForRegion methods of CLLocationManager properly mapped.

   [~ygbr] Do we have a PR for the pieces you wished merged?</li>
