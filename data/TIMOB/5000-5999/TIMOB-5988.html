<h3>Description</h3>

Description:
While testing KS, Phone>Play Movie>Embedded, I noticed that the data displayed at the top of the screen was populated, but "i:" (activeMovie.initialPlaybackTime) and "e:" (activeMovie.endPlaybackTime) both reported "NaN".

Steps to reproduce:
1) Launch KS built with 1.8.0
2) Navigate to Phone>Play Movie>Embedded
3) The movie should begin to play. Tap the movie to activate the data labels

Result:
"i" and "e" report "NaN"

Expected:
Numerical representation of initialPlaybackTime and endPlaybackTime

Note:
This data was not displayed for 1.7.5 KS, and I could not build 1.8.0 KS with the 1.7.5 SDK

   This is the intended behavior.  NaN is the sentinel value returned when asked for timing information that is not available.</li>

   Closing as invalid</li>
