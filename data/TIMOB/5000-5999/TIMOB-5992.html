<h3>Description</h3>

The current build scripts do not allow the user to specify a retina-display density during the simulator launch. Once this is implemented, we'll need to add an additional configuration option to Studio.

   Going to take this opportunity to upgrade to ios-sim as well. Jeff has given his signoff to move away from his original iphonesim project.</li>

   <h4>TESTING</h4>
   ----
   
   To test, you need to perform two tasks:
   
   1. Build and run an existing studio project on both iPhone and iPad simulators
   2. Run the builder.py script from the Titanium install manually on a project, feeding it device family AND simulator types; you will need to test with the following family/sim combinations:
   
   * iphone [iphone sim]
   * ipad [ipad sim]
   * iphone retina [retina sim]
   * iphone iphone [iphone sim]
   * iphone ipad [ipad sim]
   * ipad ipad [ipad sim]
   * ipad retina [ipad sim - no retina support for ipad]
   
   The script should take a total of 6 (or 7, if you're feeding in simulator type) arguments. They are:
   
   /Library/Application\ Support/Titanium/mobilesdk/osx/1.8.0.1/iphone/builder.py run <code>pwd</code> 4.0 com.appcelerator.test test [one of the above configurations]</li>

   Reopening this bug to handle TIMOB-6460. The build scripts should still take the 'retina' devicetype, but should NOT display a retina simulator, in 1.8.0.1. The correct order for fixing this bug is:
   
   * TIMOB-6460 is resolved
   * TISTUD-760 is resolved (addition of checkbox to launch with 'retina' devicetype)
   * TIMOB-5992 (this bug) is resolved</li>

   Unfortunately there were a number of serious difficulties with this, and there are better ways to switch into retina mode (for example, we don't have to kill the simulator when starting a new process if we're smart).
   
   In particular the simulator boot API has no way to specify a hardware mode, and manually mangling the config file for simulator turned out to be very dangerous and unstable (and caused unexpected behavior when users PREVIOUSLY had a device in retina mode, manually).</li>

   Newest version of ios-sim now includes retina support.</li>

   iOS simulators are supported with retina display providing extra flag as '--retina' on command line.
   
   Tested by running as 'ti build -T simulator -F iphone -Y iphone --retina -p ios'
   with varying flag -F and -Y value as iphone and ipad.
   
   Verified on :
   SDK version:  3.1.0.v20130318205654  
   CLI version : 3.0.24
   OS : MAC OSX 10.7.5
   XCode : 4.5.1
