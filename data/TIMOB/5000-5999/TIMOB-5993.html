<h3>Description</h3>

Description:
While testing KS, KS Phone>Sound>Record, I noted that both test devices had the audio line type set as "headset". While I somewhat expected this for the iPad, I was not expecting this for the iPhone. Using SDK 1.7.5, Ti.Media.audioLineType reports "unknown" on the iPad 2 and reports "receiver/mic" on the iPhone 4s.

Steps to reproduce:
1) Install KS 1.8.0 on device
2) Navigate to Phone>Sound>Record
3) note the "audio line type" data

Result:
Audio line type shows "headset" for both devices tested

Expected:
Audio line type varies based on device capabilities

Note:
This does not occur on SDK 1.7.5 with KS 1_7_X
