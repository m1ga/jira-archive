   This change has far reaching implications. As well as trying the described KitchenSink test in *both* V8 and Rhino, also do the following in both runtimes:
   * In KS, run Platform > CommonJS. All 3 tests should pass
   * In KS, run Platform > JS Includes. A popup should show that says "first name: Joey middle name: Waldo last name: Smith"
   * In KS, open, close, and re-open any test a few times to test that re-opening windows works.
   * Do a full pass of Drillbit. Everything should pass _except_:
   ** <code>media</code> should fail in both Rhino and V8 (this is a separate issue being worked on by Bill: TIMOB-6238)
   ** <code>xml</code> should fail in V8 (known / runtime issue)</li>

   Just a quick note for testers: the Media test should actually succeed now, so if it doesn't let me know :)</li>

   Tested with 1.8.0.1.v20111207090257
   Xoom (3.2.1) - v8
