   After some research, I found out that it is difficult to implement locale for DatePicker. It can be done with DatePickerDialog, but not DatePicker. One way to do it using the current implementation of DatePicker is to change system Locale, but even that only affect the format, not the language. This is probably an internal issue with android. Currently, we would need to re-implement the widget if we want to include this feature.</li>

   This was also present in 1_7_X, and it looks like we won't be able to change the locale for a date picker without re-implementing the entire control. Marking as tbs-1.9.0 for now.</li>
