   I think you're confusing being logged-in/logged-out of facebook (having a valid facebook session that has not been logged-out-of) with the browser (web view) asking whether you want it to auto-fillin the fields the next time it sees this login page.  Those are two different things.
   
   A facebook session is valid in an app until you logout or until it expires.  By saying you don't want your credentials remembered, you're just saying that next time you have to login, you don't want your credentials to be filled-in automatically for you.
   
   If you agree, you can close this as invalid. If not, we can talk more about it.</li>
