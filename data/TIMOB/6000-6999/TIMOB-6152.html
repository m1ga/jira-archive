<h3>Description</h3>

It would be nice if there was a way to toggle the Ti.UI.iPad.Popover.

The usual usecase is that you have a button that opens the popover. If the button is clicked while the popover is visible, nothing happens, but the expected action is that the visible popover is dismissed.

<h4>Testcase</h4>
The testcase shows that if you click the button while the popover is open, nothing happens. What I would like to do is to just switch out the ".show" method with ".toggle" and then it would work as intended.
<code><pre>
Ti.UI.backgroundColor = '#fff';

var win = Ti.UI.createWindow();

var button = Ti.UI.createButton({
	title: 'Open popover',
	width: 150,
	height: 40
})

var popover = Ti.UI.iPad.createPopover({
	height: 300,
	width: 300,
	backgroundColor: '#fff'
});

button.addEventListener('click', function() {
	popover.show({
		view: button
	});
});

win.leftNavButton = button;

win.open({
	modal: true
});
</pre></code>

This could be easily solved by having a method on the popover object called ".toggle()", that will show the popover if it's not visible, otherwise hide it.

   bump! This has been open for a really long time with no solution. This is a good ticket, with a testcase and link to a really simple fix. I find it annoying that you would just ignore this for so long.</li>
