<h3>Description</h3>

Currently, the iOS build scripts do not support copying data from projects' <code>platform/iphone</code> directories into the bundle. This support needs to be added.

   Current practice calls for non-'resource' platform-specific elements to be placed in <code>modules/iphone</code>, which are no longer copied over by the resolution to this bug. Instead, we need to resolve this concurrently, to update the Kitchen Sink app appropriately.</li>

   <h4>TESTING</h4>
   ----
   
   1. The best app to test with is KS. Import it into Ti Studio and build for both simulator and device. On both platforms, exit the app and check the 'Settings' app to see if there is a section for 'Kitchen Sink' - if there is, then this bug is resolved. Note that you must use a KS build which places the 'Settings.bundle' file in 'platforms/iphone' (available in sptramer/timob-5062)
   
   2. You must also run the export tool to ensure that these files are copied correctly. Run transport.py on Kitchen Sink, and ensure that the 'Settings.bundle' file is placed into the 'Resources' directory.
