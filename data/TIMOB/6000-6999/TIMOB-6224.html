<h3>Description</h3>

Templates crash and have build errors on Windows with both Rhino and V8 (Android). The build error is on the first run in Windows XP. The runtime errors are on Windows 7 and Windows XP. Rhino and V8 have different runtime errors. The Windows XP runtime errors are consistent, but the Windows 7 errors cease after a few runs. All errors are attached. Ubuntu 10.4 and Mac OS X Lion did not have the runtime errors or build errors.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Create a new project using 1.8.0.1 (V8 or Rhino), choose next (instead of finish).
2. Pick a template (Single Window, Master/Detail, or Tabbed) and finish creating the project.
3. Run the project (emulator or device).

Expected Result:
Project should build and run without build errors or runtime errors.

Actual Result:
Titanium Studio produces a build error in Windows XP on the first run (attached).
Rhino and V8 crash when run from Windows 7, but only the first few runs (Rhino and V8 have separate runtime errors <attached>).
Rhino and V8 crash every time when run from Windows XP.

   I also tested the templates against SDK 1.7.5 on Windows XP and Windows 7.
   There were no build errors. The Windows 7 deployments were all successfull (Single Window, Master/Detail, and Tabbed), and most of the Windows XP deployments were successfull. There was a runtime crash in 1.7.5 on Windows XP in the Master/Detail Template app. The log is attached.</li>

   The Master/Detail 1.7.5 crash has been deferred to TISTUD-836 <Titanium Studio: Templates - New Master/Detail Template project created in Windows XP crashes on launch in Android>.</li>
