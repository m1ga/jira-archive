   Can we block? This is both a technical question and a behavior change question. We've had this non-blocking behavior since the dawn of time.
   
   According to the docs <a href="https://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#</a>!/api/Global, it states:

   Note that unlike a web browser-based version of alert, the method is asynchronous. However, only one alert dialog will be visible and modal at a time.
   
   Be aware that this method may be removed in the future.

   While the alert doesn't block the JavaScript execution, it apparently blocks other alerts from being displayed at the same time.
   
   Perhaps this ticket should be resolved as won't fix? [~ingo] thoughts?</li>

   Based on the number of requests/watchers, I'm fine marking as won't fix. If somehow people decide that it's super-important, we can revisit.</li>
<li>Chris Barber 2016-08-22

   Marking as won't fix for the reasons above.</li>

   Closing ticket as Won't Fix with reference to the above comments.</li>
