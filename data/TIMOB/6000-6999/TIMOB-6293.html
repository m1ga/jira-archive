<h3>Description</h3>

A customer wants to add a new feature to control the version string. The reason is our building system appends a timestamp to the version bundle string of the app. For apps with longer versioning systems, this can quickly make the string longer than the submission policies allow.

A current workaround is edit the compiler.py under the TiSDK/iphone folder to remove the timestamp.

   Isn't the fix for this to make sure we comply with the submission guidelines and not force people to hand edit the file or in studio?</li>
<li>Kevin McGrath 2011-12-05

   Commenting here per ticket above.
   
   Correct. The request is two-fold. One is to make sure submission guidelines are always complied with (perhaps impose max character limit if string is altered during compile). Two would be to notify the user that their apps setting are being altered automatically, and provide option to opt-out.</li>
<li>Stephen Tramer 2011-12-06

   Should note that we're manually adjusting the version string in the builder/compiler to include a timestamp; this can almost certainly be removed. That's probably the fix for this one.</li>

   test instruction...
   
   Test 1
   1. Build any app and run for Simulator
   2. exit and change something in the app and rerun the app in Simulator and see if the changes have taken place.
   
   Test 2
   1. Build for device.
   2. Open the build <Appname>.ipa file, change the extension of the file to .zip . Extract the file go inside and open up the info.plist.
   3. Change something in the same app, rebuild it again for device and Check to see if app get reinstalled on device properly. Repeat Step 2 & 3.
   
   Test 3
   1. Build for distribution
   2. Package the app. 
   3. Open the build <Appname>.ipa file, change the extension of the file to .zip . Extract the file go inside and open up the info.plist.
   4. Check to see if the info.plist Bundle Version string is short . for example 1.0.2.3 i.e if you specified your app version in tiapp.xml to be 1.0.2 major/minor/patch
   
   NOTE : MAKE SURE WHEN YOU BUILD FOR DEVICE, WHAT EVER VERSION YOU SPECIFIED IN TIAPP.XML IS REFLECTED PROPERLY IN INFO.PLIST</li>

   pull $889 pending

   Properly fix-versioning, but leaving open until we can merge to 1.7.6.</li>
<li>Eric Merriman  2011-12-14

   No longer occurs with SDK 1.8.0.1.v20111214093905. Keeping open until verified in 1.9.0 branch.</li>
<li>Stephen Feather 2012-02-26

   I think the question arises regarding what is development and what is distribution.
   
   The changes in Pull 889 assume that 'development' is anything built and not passed out to 'Distribute - App Store'.  IE: timestamp remains on simulator and device builds.
   
   However, not all testing is done only on simulator or local/tethered devices.  This change affects AdHoc testing support systems such as TestFlight in that unless the developer manually updates the version in TiApp.xml, one build of version 1.4.1 looks the same as the next as the CFBundleVersion is not unique and not incremented.
   
   Apple seems to expect CFBundleVersion to be used as an incremented string.
   
   While I understand the original customers unique situation, in meeting their needs, the changes affected a large portion of the community negatively.  Those users not using an outside/custom versioning system will have to hack back in the autoincrement code that was removed, or manually edit the TiApp.xml to increment the version before distributing via AdHoc for testing.
   
   This change needs to be re-visited.</li>
