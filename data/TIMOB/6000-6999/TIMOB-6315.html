   Cygwin is not required for this.
   
   Here are some things you will need to install:
   
   Install android ndk and set it as an environment variable ANDROID_NDK
   Install android sdk and set it as an environment variable ANDROID_SDK
   Install gperf (<a href="http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/gperf.htm)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/gperf.htm)</a> and add it to your path
   Install Ant (<a href="http://ant.apache.org/)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://ant.apache.org/)</a> and add it to your path
   Install scons and add it to your path.
   
   Once your environment has been set up, run 'scons' in the titanium_mobile root, and an sdk should be generated under the dist directory.

   Reopening issue
   
   Windows 7 and XP
   
   Scons reports it builds successfully, however I then am unable to open the zipped SDK.
   
   I grabbed this output at the end of scons:
   <code><pre>
   BUILD SUCCESSFUL
   Total time: 1 minute 2 seconds
   scons: done reading SConscript files.
   scons: Building targets ...
   package_sdk(["dummy-sdk-target"], [])
   Packaging MobileSDK (1.9.0)...
   Generating JSCA...
   C:\Python27\python.exe C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\Desktop\fromGit\titanium_mobile\apidoc\docgen.py -f jsca --stdout
   scons: *** [dummy-sdk-target] C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\Desktop\fromGit\titanium_mobile\dist\android\libs/*.*: The system cannot find the path specified
   scons: building terminated because of errors.
   </pre></code></li>

   NOTE: This should be run from windows command prompt, not cygwin.</li>

   Looks like this was resulting from JAVA_HOME being in a path with spaces in it.
   
   Michael- Could you verify that it works now?

   Verified fixed with latest master on Win 7 and Win XP. Scons was successful and resulting build was able to build Studio projects and run in the emulator. Also verified scons on Mac with same steps (plus iOS) to ensure no harm has come to the other side of the fence.</li>
