<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>New feature request</h4>

Please add the possibility of running the .db (read only) file from the Resources folder. For now the Ti.Database.install copies the .db file and leaves the old under Resources which makes the app to weight too much. For example having 50MB of read only database makes the app to weight 100MB.

   This is a pretty significant issue for a large DB.  Initial startup times are horrendous and corruption problems requiring delete/reinstall of the app are not uncommon.</li>

   Co-sign. Having to install read only databases is a waste of disk space.</li>

   I agree, I wish I could  read my database directly from the app bundle.</li>

   Please implement this. I develop dictionaries and the pre-installed databases are huge! Even when zipping the files, the duplicity in space is a waste of space. Thanks!</li>
