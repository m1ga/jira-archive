<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>New Feature Request</h4>

Please add the functionality for launching the app from the URL. Similar functionality that is provided on iOS with handleOpenURL so that it would allow you to register the specific url path. 

The final result should be that while inside some .html file we put <a href="myapp://test">test</a> it would open the myapp and we will get the input ("test"). That should also work when we are inside the application and using the webview (should trigger the internal event).

The Titanium code should look like:

<code><pre>
Ti.App.addEventListener("handleOpenURL",function(e){
           alert(e.input);   //would return the input list/array
});
</pre></code>

   <code>handleOpenURL</code> is an iOS specific event, that is not used by the Titanium SDK (as of 5.4.0). It may have been supported once upon a time, but certainly not today.
   
   There are alternative ways to get the URL and handle it. For Android, you must read <code>Ti.Android.currentActivity.intent.data</code> as soon as the app launches. For iOS, you reference <code>Ti.App.getArguments().url</code>. It is suggested that <code>Ti.App.getArguments().url</code> is also supported on Android.
   
   For an example of how to use it, please refer to the following articles:

   Since we have a prescribed way of handling URL schemes, I see this "new feature" as being something we're interesting in adding today. Resolving as won't fix.</li>
