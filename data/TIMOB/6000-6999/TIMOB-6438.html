<h3>Description</h3>

Steps to reproduce:

Grab the QTS app from git@github.com:appcelerator/titanium_mobile_tests_internal.git

1. Launch the app on an iOS device running iOS 5+
2. Once the app is running, press any table view row (you don't have to run the test)
3. Navigate back to the main table view with all the tests
4. Press a new table view row

Expected result:
Able to run tests one after the other

Actual result:
Pressing the new table view row doesn't launch any new tests

   Ran git bisect and found out this is broken since commit number "[cd2d7f7dbbd1efa1c098800d66b53777eaf2db1f] Merge pull request #269 from rseagraves/TIMOB-4523". Update to JSCore.</li>
<li>Stephen Tramer 2011-12-04

   Vishal, can you please distribute your workaround for this to the QE team?
   
   This requires a JSCore update and must be postponed.</li>
<li>Stephen Tramer 2011-12-04

   Bumping into sprint 49 so that we can perform some preemptive evaluation to find out which JSCore we're using, etc. before this is resolved (if we have time).</li>

   As a temporary workaround on ios device/simulator click on the first row (title:'Cross-platform') a few times before you start testing. This seems to magically solve the issue.</li>
<li>Stephen Tramer 2012-01-03

   Scheduling for 1.9.0 timeframe as this is a JSCore bug. We will try and batch them together to get a single JSCore update for the next minor rev.</li>
<li>Stephen Tramer 2012-02-15

   Reassigning to Thom as part of the post-1.8.2 pass where it will get evaluated to see if JSCore fixed up this nasty problem then.</li>
<li>Stephen Tramer 2012-02-15

   Bumping for Thom to validate in S5 against a new JSCore.</li>
<li>Blain Hamon 2012-02-22

   Looks like the new JSCore fixes this.</li>
<li>Stephen Tramer 2012-02-27

   Confirmed to be resolved by jscore update TIMOB-6292, putting in the appropriate sprint for resolution</li>
<li>Blain Hamon 2012-02-27

    Fixed by pull #1520.</li>
