<h3>Description</h3>

Steps To Reproduce:
1. Create a new application
2. Launch application 
3. Press the home key
4. Wait 10 minute and re-launch application 
5. Press the back button

Actual:
You get a start event and end event that is 10 minutes apart from each other

Expected:
Should get a background or something to tell the app owner that their application isn't actually being ran the entire time.
According to analytics this app was running for well over 10 minutes when in fact it was just launched and put in the background

Note: 
Has been like this all the way back to 1.7.2

   The problem is, there is no difference in this test case than bringing up a camera activity that doesn't belong to the app. At that point, all of the apps activities are paused but the task stack for the app is still very much valid and active.
   
   On Android, there is not a concept of the App being backgrounded like on iOS. Individual Activities are paused and resumed, but they typically do not describe the full lifecycle of the application.</li>

   Closing due to time passed and lack of progress and input.</li>
