   The app.js indicates that you're using an older version of the KS test for this.  Can you update to the newer version?  You'll see it works then.  The problem with this version of app.js is that it's checking just "Titanium.Platform.version >= 3.2" (or whatever).  That means it would only work if you had Android 3.2 (or higher) or iOS 3.2 (or higher) installed.  That check is there for *iOS* 3.2 and isn't relevant for Android.  I removed it entirely recently from KitchenSink because a) we don't even support iOS < 3.2 anymore (at least I don't so); b) in Android, it prevented the video player view from being put on to the window.
   
   Now that we have (almost) parity with iOS in the VideoPlayer, our (Android's) default for the <code>fullscreen</code> property is <code>false</code> just like theirs.  That means for <code>.play()</code> to work, you either need to put the player on the window (like iOS) or set <code>fullscreen: true</code>, in which case the player is not put on a view but rather starts a whole new activity window when it starts.
   
   Information will be included in our release notes when 1.8 is released.</li>
