<h3>Description</h3>

When using a machine running Ubuntu 10.04 without the Android NDK installed, installing the Android NDK (as of writing it is version r7), then using scons to build, the Android NDK gives this error when building,

"Android NDK: Host 'awk' tool is outdated. Please define HOST_AWK to point to Gawk or Nawk !"

Steps to reproduce:
1. Have a machine running Ubuntu 10.04 without the Android NDK installed
2. Install the Android NDK (making sure to add the required path variables to the .bashrc profile)
3. Scons the mobile sdk

Expected result:
Building with scons succeeds

Actual result:
Scons fails and prints this error Android NDK: Host 'awk' tool is outdated. Please define HOST_AWK to point to Gawk or Nawk !

   This is not related to anything we're doing.  It's a known issue with NDK. cf <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8384213/android-ndk-revision-7-host-awk-tool-is-outdated-error" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8384213/android-ndk-revision-7-host-awk-tool-is-outdated-error</a>
   
   Basically, in the "prebuilt/linux-x86" folder under the NDK installation folder, rename <code>awk</code> to <code>awk_</code>.
   
   I've just gone through setting up on Ubuntu, and documented the requirements.  I'll pass this on to whomever writes such guides.

   We have a known workaround but it seems like there's nothing we can do on the platform side for this issue.</li>
