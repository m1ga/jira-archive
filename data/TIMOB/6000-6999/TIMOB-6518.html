<h3>Description</h3>

We're currently getting reports from users who are manually swapping the simulator into retina mode that they can't do so anymore, due to the <code>--retina</code> flag support in ios-sim manually twiddling the application settings (due to ipad/iphone retina setting rendering problems). We need to disable this flag for the next release to ensure that people can still get to the retina sim.

   Test for resolving this bug is in TIMOB-6460; curiously the expected result should be that you are allowed to pass the 'retina' flag, but it launches the iPhone simulator NOT in retina mode.</li>

   Silly me; this duplicates TIMOB-6460. Comment about ios-sim should go on there and it should be linked to the retina support bug for iOS. Misread the bug description and thought it was a comment on the original bug for some reason.</li>
