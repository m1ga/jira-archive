<h3>Description</h3>

On droid 2 2.2, if you enter the test and exit multiple times you will eventually get to a state where when you click on the test, rather that the test opening immediately and showing the animation there is a delay and then only a black screen is shown.  This is suspected to a be a threading deadlock issue.  V8 only.

Reported that the issue cannot be reproduced on several other devices with 2.3 and up.
