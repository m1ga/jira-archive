<h3>Description</h3>

While running Basic Breakpoint test case there are two points at which the stepping is not working as expected.

The first is after the first breakpoint hit where the tester must hit "Step Over". At this point it is expected that line 2 of app.js is highlighted. This does not occur. Clicking "Step over" again (as is required as a workaround with some other discovered bugs) results is a source not found error.

Steps to reproduce:
 1) Create a new project in studio called debug_test 
2) Move the js files from the debug test project in titanium_mobile_tests_internal
3) Refer to the test plan at <a href="http://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/tp/Debugger+Test+Plan" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/tp/Debugger+Test+Plan</a> 
4) Execute test case 1013

Result: 
Step 5 fails to produce expected result. Breaks at import.js line 13
  
Expected:
Step 5 "step over" highlights line 2 of app.js

   Tested with Ti Mob Build 1.8.0.1.v20111214093905
   
   The actual result is that instead of hitting call frame at 2 it hits at 13</li>

   Michael, which file was that line 13?</li>
