<h3>Description</h3>

Steps to reproduce:

1. Create a new Titanium mobile project and copy the following code to app.js
<code><pre>
for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    Ti.API.debug("Hello: " + i);
}
</pre></code>

3. Set breakpoint on the Ti.API.debug statement
4. Right click on the breakpoint and go to Breakpoint Properties...
5. Select Enable Condition
6. Enter <code>i == </code>
7. Run in debug 

Actual: App is fully deployed and debugger does not hit breakpoint or generate error for bad breakpoint condition.
Expected: Debugger should hit breakpoint and generate error for bad breakpoint condition.
