<h3>Description</h3>

While running breakpoint eval test, starting with step 6, the tester must press "resume" and validate a variable and console output. A single press does not generally work, and the variables that were expected to increment by 2 are incremented by one. On the second press of resume, the expected results may be seen.

Steps to reproduce:
1) Create a new project in studio called debug_test
2) Move the js files form the debug test project in titanium_mobile_tests_internal
3) refer to the test plan at <a href="http://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/tp/Debugger+Test+Plan" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/tp/Debugger+Test+Plan</a>
4) Execute test case 1014

Result:
At step 6, the user must press resume twice where once is called for.

Expected:
A single press of resume get expected call frame and variable results

   Tested with 10.7.2, 10.6.8, Win 7 on 1.8.0.1.v20111214093905
   Test is hitting a conditional breakpoint when the condition evaluates to false. First breakpoint goes to app.js: 16 when it should have skipped that since e=90 and not 95</li>

   This is related to the issue w/ breakpoints that have conditions.</li>
