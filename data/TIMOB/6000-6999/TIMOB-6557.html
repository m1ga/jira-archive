<h3>Description</h3>

According to Jeff, some developers are experiencing some lag in view rendering performance (~50ms) that is affecting specific types of application development. This ticket is for specific re-evaluation of the view add/rendering code, which should be considered part of the layout/composite spec eval and implementation pass for 1.9.

This could be as simple as batching operations together. The layout specification would need to be updated to provide support for batching all UI operations, not just layouts on specific views (although we might want that, too).

This may also be able to be solved by any work on concurrency that allows specific operations on the main thread (i.e. Ti.mainThread(function f() { /* view stuff */ });).

   the main issue is when you do an addView, there's code that adds the view after only after 50ms... so you can't add/remove views faster than 50ms, which obviously doesn't work in animations or any sophisticated UI.</li>
