<h3>Description</h3>

During distribution, it looks like the CFBundleShortVersionString is always getting mangled to be "1.0" regardless of the version of the app. This could be an Apple bug, part of the distribution we don't control, or another issue.

We should also be evaluating distribution as a whole.

Testing requires only packaging for distribution (not actual submission).

   I think the priority of the ticket must be high. People are unable to release new version of their apps without putting customized Info.plist file on application main directory (which you need to convert it to XML first).</li>
