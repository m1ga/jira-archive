<h3>Description</h3>

In iOS 4.3.x devices, Coverflow images don't scroll (only transition) when the user finger-scrolls left and right.
In iOS 5.x devices, Coverflow images scroll continuously along with the user's finger until the image transitions.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Run KitchenSink.
2. Go to: Base UI > Views > Coverflow View > Coverflow Local Files.
3. Touch and hold the main image. Slowly scroll left and right to change images.

Expected Result:

Images should continuously scroll until they transition.

Actual Result:

Images don't scroll, only transition (iOS 4.3.x).
Images do scroll in iOS 5.x devices.

   Note to self: This is due to 4.3 generating layoutSubviews events where 5.0 isn't.</li>

   Closing ticket as invalid as there is a new version of Kitchen Sink and we no longer support the old version.</li>
