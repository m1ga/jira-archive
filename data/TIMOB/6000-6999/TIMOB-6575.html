<h3>Description</h3>

During packaging testing I created a universal app but included only the Apple "required" icons as opposed to all 7 icons including the optional icons. After packaging I attempted to "verify" from the Xcode organizer. The verification failed citing the missing optional icons.

Please see attached image, but disregard the bundle ID mismatch. I was expecting that.

Steps to reproduce:
1) Create a new titanium mobile application
2) Include on the 57x57 and 72x72 icons required for a universal application
3) Package for distribution
4) In the organizer, click "verify"

Result:
Optional and not included icons are reported as errors

Expected:
Verification completes with no errors

   Does not occur with SDK 1.8.0.1.v20111214093905. Leaving open until this can be verified in the 1.9.0 branch.</li>
