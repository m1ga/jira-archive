<h3>Description</h3>

Description:
In KS, on the Phone>Play Movie>Remote streaming 2 test, the link is bad, and the movie will not play. When coming out of the test, I noticed some console output I had not seen before. It was:

Dec 13 10:28:12 unknown KitchenSink[12060] <Warning>: An instance 0x50d720 of class AVPlayerItem was deallocated while key value observers were still registered with it. Observation info was leaked, and may even become mistakenly attached to some other object. Set a breakpoint on NSKVODeallocateBreak to stop here in the debugger. Here's the current observation info:
	<NSKeyValueObservationInfo 0x8b4f0b0> (
	<NSKeyValueObservance 0x51c5d0: Observer: 0x8b517b0, Key path: nonForcedSubtitleDisplayEnabled, Options: <New: YES, Old: NO, Prior: NO> Context: 0x0, Property: 0x51a9d0>
	<NSKeyValueObservance 0x501d10: Observer: 0x10205f0, Key path: presentationSize, Options: <New: NO, Old: NO, Prior: NO> Context: 0x0, Property: 0x51aaf0>
	)
Dec 13 10:28:13 unknown UIKitApplication:com.appcelerator.titanium[0x7075][12060] <Notice>: [FATAL] Orphaned [object TiUIAlertDialog] is trying to forget [object TiUIAlertDialog].

I could not reliable reproduce this when I attempted the same steps. The Orphaned AlertDialog was reproducible however.

Steps to reproduce:
1) Install KS built with SDK 1.8.0.1
2) Navigate to Phone>Play Movie>Remote streaming 2
3) Back out of the test

Result:
Console logs error

Expected:
No errors logged

Notes:
I could not reproduce this in 1.7.5 KS and SDK
