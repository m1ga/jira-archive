<h3>Description</h3>

Description:
In KS, on the Phone>Orientation> test, clicking the "Set landscape" button rotates the UI to landscape, but the navBar remains the larger "portrait size" instead of slimming to the smaller "landscape size". This does not occur with 1.7.5. In 1.7.5 the button rotates the UI and the navBar sizes appropriately.

Steps to reproduce:
1) Install KS built with SDK 1.8.0.1
2) Navigate to Phone>Orientation>
3) Click the "Set landscape" button

Result:
UI rotates, but navBar size remains "portrait"

Expected:
UI rotation and navBar resize

Note:
Does not occur with 1.7.5 SDK and KS

   Okay, after experimenting, the exact sequence is, while in portrait, press 'Reset Orientation' then 'Set Landscape'</li>

   Tested with studio version 1.0.7.201112140358
   Ti Mob SDK 1.8.0.1.v20111214093905
   OSX Lion
   iPhone 4 OS 4.3.5
   iPad 2 OS 5.0.1
   
   Expected behavior of setting orientation to landscape is shown
   
   *Keeping open until testing begins against 1.9.0</li>

   The checked-in fix seems to prevent building the application on the simulator for me.
   
   Looking at the code, it looks like ignoringRotationToOrientation which was moved from TiWindowProxy was defined in TiViewController.h, but the empty method was never added to TiViewController.m. Perhaps a file was missed on the commit? Adding the method fixes my build problem.</li>

   Mike -
   
   We are not getting this error internally. You will need to clean your project after switching to a new SDK - there could be a stale object file which contains the old build symbols.
   
   If the issue persists, we require a full build log.</li>

   Closing as verified fixed against 1.8.0.1</li>
