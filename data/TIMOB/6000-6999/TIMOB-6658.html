<h3>Description</h3>

Run attached file in Android, click the fly in/out box. The box animates off the bottom of the screen and keeps going until you click the screen. It will then animate back to its original location. Depending on how long you wait to click, it might have moved a long way off the screen and take a while to return. If you don't click, it apparently just keeps going south.

Bug existed at least in 1.7.5 and probably earlier. Confirmed it still exists in 1.8.0.1RC.
Works fine on iOS.
This is a lab example from the Advanced course.

   hi this is still an issue in 2.1.3 & 2.1.4
   Any news on this bug?

   In my case (Android), I found as long as the item was onscreen (even if not visible - hidden behind another element) then animation complete fires as usual. But if trying to position element totally offscreen, then you get the weird case of animation complete not firing until some sort of user interaction happens. I should stress this does NOT happen in the emulator - only on device.</li>
