		"description": "h3.Problem\r\nWhen trying to do the usual 1st step after creating the template, i.e. open the newly created, UNTOUCHED, module in the xcode (i.e. \"open <module name>.xcodeproj\") - xcode hangs with the message \"running 1 of 1 custom scripts\" (please see 1st attached screen shot).\r\n\r\nIf trying to close xcode without it finishing - titanium studio gives an error when i'm trying to use the module on the device (please see 2nd attached screen shot). the code of the app.js is just a copy of automatically created app.js from the example folder of the module.\r\n\r\nThat appears only on SDK 1.7.5. With SDK 1.7.3 it works as expected.\r\n\r\nThe customer has lion with the change inside the titanium.xcconfig (Other Sources folder) the TITANIUM_SDK variable. TITANIUM_SDK = ~/Library/Application Support/Titanium/mobilesdk/osx/$(TITANIUM_SDK_VERSION)\r\n\r\nTried recreating the module probably about 100 times with different combinations of Titanium SDK version and test app SDK versions.\r\n\r\nSome more information about the process:\r\n- he always delete Build forlder of the app before re-compiling;\r\n- When re-building a module, he always removes the previous version of that module from \"modules\" folder and place a newly created zip file into \"modules\" folder to make sure that Titanium build process pucks it up and installs it;\r\n- he always trying to build newly created module in xCode to make sure everything goes smoothly (this step, just to remind you, did not work for Ti SDK 1.7.5: xCode hangs with the message regarding customs scripts - see my 1st post);\r\n\r\nI believe this situation has something to do with the target platforms being armv7 and armv6 by default in Titanium, while xCode expects only armv7.\r\n\r\nWe have got his project.pbxproj http://support-admin.appcelerator.com/files/f2fb47e6-205d-11e1-935c-12313819f1f3/mdb.xcodeproj.zip and updated it with armv6. The updated file looks like the one attached to JIRA. The problem still appears and the Xcode hangs.\r\n\r\nCustomer has already reinstalled the XCode.\r\n\r\nh3.Customers Workaround\r\nHe has discovered that the problem is in the presence of armv6 in the xcode project's targets.\r\n\r\nonce he has removed armv6 from the builder.py, and re-generated his module - it started working.\r\n\r\nhere is what he has done:\r\n\r\n-- copied 1.7.5 sdk to the new folder 1.7.5.1, effectively creating new sdk version - 1.7.5.1;\r\n\r\n-- modified line 1108 in builder.py from the floder .../1.7.5.1/iphone by removing armv6, i.e.:\r\n\r\nwas: extra_args = [\"VALID_ARCHS=armv6 armv7 i386\"]\r\n\r\nnow: extra_args = [\"VALID_ARCHS=armv7 i386\"]\r\n\r\n-- set the current sdk to 1.7.5.1 by executing the following command in the terminal:\r\n\r\nalias titanium='/Library/Application\\ Support/Titanium/mobilesdk/osx/1.7.5.1/titanium.py'\r\n\r\n-- re-generated a module:\r\n\r\ntitanium create --type=module --platform=iphone --name=testmod --id=com.mod.testmod\r\n\r\nthis newly created module works, xcode does not hang when trying to \"open testmod.xcodeproj\", and when this module is included into an app - app compiles OK and works on a real device.\r\n\r\nRemining the initial problem:\r\n\r\nUnder 1.7.5 xcode was hanging on \"open <mod>.xcodeproj\", was never finishing whatever it has been doing, so i had to close it. the resulting module was build by ./build.py with success and worked in simulator, but when i was trying to compile it for a real device (ipad 2 and iphone 4s in my case), compilation was failing (i've attached images of ti studio screen).",
