<h3>Description</h3>

Resources fail to update on app re-deployment. For instance, an existing image that is edited will not be updated by Fastdev after re-deploying the app.

This affects V8/Rhino. Regression.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Create Default Project, Run Code in Android Emulator 2.3.3 using V8:

<code><pre>
Titanium.UI.createWindow({backgroundImage:'KS_nav_ui.png'}).open();
</pre></code>

2. Navigate to 'KS_nav_ui.png' in the OS file system.
3. Open 'KS_nav_ui.png' in an image editor, and change it in a noticeable way (save over original).
4. Re-deploy the app in Studio without cleaning.

Expected Result:

The app should have the newest version of the image.

Actual Result:

The app still has the old version of the image. If the image did not exist before, nothing will be shown in it's place because the old version of the image in the resources was null.

   This is specific to background images, not generally.  For example, if you created an imageview with that image, it would reload each time.  The problem is that background image fetching is not making use of FastDev.

   It looks like the icon property of tabs is still affected, and we might need to check the "image property" of every type of object we support.</li>
