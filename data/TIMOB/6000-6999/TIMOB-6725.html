<h3>Description</h3>

On Android, the View class has backgroundSelectedColor, backgroundSelectedImage properties.

In TableViewRow, we expose selectedBackgroundColor, selectedBackgroundImage properties.

On iOS, I believe this is the only way to set the selected background color. 

On Android, we issue a deprecation warning and tell people they should be using backgroundSelectedColor, backgroundSelectedImage properties instead.

Something here is a tad fishy.
