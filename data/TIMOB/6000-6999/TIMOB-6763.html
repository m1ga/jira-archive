<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Problem description</h4>
Customer compiled his app with the new Mobile SDK 1.8RC3 and it's getting continuous crashing (at startup, when sending audio, etc.). 

<h4>STEPS TO REPRODUCE</h4>
1. Install app into device
2. Start another instance of the app in the simulator
3. Follow the setup instructions in the section "EXTRA INFO"
4. Send audio and photos from the device to the simulator app. 
4. Close the app in the device.
5. Send several messages from the app in the simulator, to the app/number in the device.
6. Resume the app in the device

<h4>EXPECTED RESULTS</h4>
The app able to receive the data. 

<h4>ACTUAL RESULTS</h4>
The app is crashing. 

<h4>EXTRA INFO</h4>
You can get the source code from the dropbox:

CE Team Share (shared with Steven Tramer and Marshall). Others can be added to access this source as necessary.
flobby-gt2appcelerator-d69a09e50fff07296c384da08ff1b8cf3f51dd5a.zip

<h4>Here is more setup info.</h4>

Testing: You will need to setup your iphone and the simulator. Once installed the app into the two devices, you will need to go to the agenda and add a number, doesn't matter which number you put, let's say you assign:

Device = +1-650-11
Simulator  = +1-650-12
Then you wil need to add the simulator number to the Device's address book, and viceversa. When you start the app, you will need to "register" the device, add the device number to the device login, and the simulator number to the simulator.

   Is there a console log at all on this? This is caused by an exception.</li>
<li>Blain Hamon 2011-12-19

   I've been trying for over an hour, and still can't recreate the crash. I just saw the console log, but unfortunately, it doesn't help.</li>
<li>Blain Hamon 2011-12-19

   Aha. Okay, to get the proper log, I'll need you to go to XCode, press Command-shift-2. Then you'll see a window similar to this screenshot. Choose devices up top, the phone on the left side, console there, and copy-paste the text there into here.</li>
<li>Blain Hamon 2011-12-20

   *Still* no luck on getting this to recreate, even with CE trying here as well. In talking with Thomas, he suggested we get all the info to try to recreate this as best as possible. What we need:
   
   The version of TiStudio.
   The version of XCode installed.
   The version of Mac OS X on the mac.
   The device and iOS version number.
   The iOS version used in simulator.
   
   Then, if at all possible, it'd be great to get the actual built files from a build that's showing this behavior. That is, the actual build folder that contains the generated xcode project and application. This will be a hefty size, but it may hold the key as to what's going on.</li>
<li>Stephen Tramer 2011-12-20

   When you get a build shipped in that shows this behavior, try and get a dSYM file to go with it so that we can symbolicate logs. If we've got the whole project + a build (with the xcodeproj) this won't be as big an issue since we can regenerate it, but still.
   
   Even an IPA file we can attach the debugger to might be enough, if it comes with a dSYM. We should probably start requesting these as well for full-app problems from customers as part of the report.</li>
<li>Stephen Tramer 2012-01-27

   These crash logs indicate the debugger was being used. This is another bug that is fixed, TIMOB-6572.</li>
<li>Stephen Tramer 2012-01-27

   Possibly resolved by TIMOB-6572.</li>
