<h3>Description</h3>

As per TIMOB-6273 the decision was made to store all databases in "Private Documents" instead of "Application Support/Database". This change requires any existing database on devices to be moved from the "old" folder to the new location. The code and comments in this change indicate that it was intended to migrate the database, but multiple tests on both simulator and device show that the "old" database is not being copied, but the database is being installed in the new location

Steps to reproduce:
<code><pre>
//Resources/data.mydb.sqlite is a "model" database.
var db = Ti.Database.install('/data/mydb.sqlite','mydb');
</pre></code>

<h4>Run once using an "old" (pre December 6th) and verify that "Application Support/database/mydb.sql" has been created.</h4>
<h4>Run once more using a new SDK and verify that the previously created database still exists, but a new database has been created in "Private Documents".</h4>
<h4>The Ti.Database.DB now points to the new database in Private Documents and the user can't access his/her data.</h4>
