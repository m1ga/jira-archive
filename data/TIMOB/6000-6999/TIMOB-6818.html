<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>PROBLEM DESCRIPTION</h4>
For iOS, when you create a new mobile project in Titanium Studio and run it on device, the ipa file it generates is well over 4MB.

<h4>STEPS TO REPRODUCE</h4>
1. Create new mobile project
2. Compile it to device
3. Check the size of the app.

<h4>ACTUAL RESULTS</h4>
App bigger than 4MB, even if it's an almost empty app.

<h4>EXPECTED RESULTS</h4>
Ti only adding the needed functionality, according to the namespaces used in the app.

   iOS already does this during the compilation step, generating binaries for device which only include those modules referenced.
   
   There are other ways we intend to "slim" binary sizes for device, but simulator build sizes are not an accurate metric of distributed binary size.
   
   This ticket is related to several ongoing issues:
   
   * Slim TiCore into i386 and armv6/armv7-only versions
   * Improve build support by modularizing components</li>

   This isn't the simulator build size. This file size is for the distributable that runs on the device. Even if using a release version compiled directly from xcode, the file size is still over 4MB.

   Your steps to reproduce include "Compile to simulator", not "compile to device." If this is incorrect you need to update them.</li>

   This ticket has been resolved invalid due to the description (which is incorrect, Titanium already does this). Instead track TIMOB-6837 and see the discussion there for why building for device (not packaging) is also not a valid indicator of final app size.</li>

   Closing issue as invalid. As per Stephen see TIMOB-6837</li>
