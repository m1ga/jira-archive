<h3>Description</h3>

In Titanium Studio v1.0.7 -> v1.1 (mobile SDK v1.7.5 -> v1.8.0), a project will not build if it contains a file in a directory of the same name. For example:

app.js
Resources
--mymod
----mymod.js

Depending on the version of Titanium Studio, the build error message ranges from marginally helpful to not helpful at all. In the best case, the build message indicates that the iOS Simulator can't find a file it is looking for within the app bundle, but gives no indication as to why. To the developer, it looks like the file exists and is in the correct place (in the project).

Note, the build fails even if mymod.js is not referenced in any way (no includes, requires, etc.). Changing the name of the parent folder (e.g. to "mymodFramework") allows the project to build successfully again.
