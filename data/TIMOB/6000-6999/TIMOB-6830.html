<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>PROBLEM DESCRIPTION</h4>
Customer wants to have a function that keeps the track of the last touch event related to UI, so they can run a custom function when that happens. This is needed in order to run a logout function in the app, in case of the app not being used by certain period of time.

<h4>EXTRA INFO </h4>
This function is something that can be used by many of our enterprise customers having similar issues.

<h4>WORKAROUND</h4>
The suggested workaround to the customer was to keep a var in the Ti.App.Properties with the date/time of the last event related to UI. They understand the workaround, but they want this kind of general tracking handed by ourselves. 

<h3>Comments</h3>

   After some cross-platform discussion, we've determined that this information is unnecessary to be part of an event. After all, it's always possible to do this:
   
   <code><pre>
   proxy.addEventListener('whatever', function() {
     var timestamp = new Date();
     // ... your application logic here ...
   });
   </pre></code>
   
   Timestamping is not a feature of enough general use to be made available as an intrinsic property on all events. A use case would need to be provided to prove otherwise; as the ticket is described, getting the current timestamp and caching it (to disk, on global scope, in a DB, etc.) is an acceptable solution.
   
   The more relevant problem is the lack of the availability of true global scoping on iOS, which will be resolved with the introduction of single-context evaluation.</li>
