		"description": "h4. PROBLEM DESCRIPTION\r\nCustomer wants to have a function that keeps the track of the last touch event related to UI, so they can run a custom function when that happens. This is needed in order to run a logout function in the app, in case of the app not being used by certain period of time.\r\n\r\nh4. EXTRA INFO \r\nThis function is something that can be used by many of our enterprise customers having similar issues.\r\n\r\nh4. WORKAROUND\r\nThe suggested workaround to the customer was to keep a var in the Ti.App.Properties with the date/time of the last event related to UI. They understand the workaround, but they want this kind of general tracking handed by ourselves. ",

A use case would need to be provided to prove otherwise; as the ticket is described, getting the current timestamp and caching it (to disk, on global scope, in a DB, etc.) is an acceptable solution.\r\n\r\nThe more relevant problem is the lack of the availability of true global scoping on iOS, which will be resolved with the introduction of single-context evaluation.",
