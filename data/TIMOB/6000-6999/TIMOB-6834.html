<h3>Description</h3>

Going forward, as part of the parity reports, we need to determine a way to have a test app that processes events for objects (especially views) and reports some parity information. We would have to drive it based on doc information for now (maybe not the greatest...) and it would have to be delayed until we could hook in automation of some kind (so that we're not adding event listeners which are fired by manually triggering them in the code itself).

This could allow us to detect many problems where the documentation is wrong, we lack parity on which events are supported, what is reported by the event, etc.
