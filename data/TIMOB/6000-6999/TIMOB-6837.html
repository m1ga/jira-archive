<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Problem</h4>
For iOS, when you create a new mobile project in Titanium Studio and run it on device, the ipa file it generates is well over 4MB. 

That's a blank project!

The application size should not be that big.

<h4>Steps to Reproduce</h4>

* create a new project in titanium studio
* hit run on device
* see the size of the ipa file it generates is over 4MB. If you unzip the ipa file and look at the actual executable inside the .app package, the executable is over 5MB.

   Tested with 1.8.0.1.RC1 and the package is still over 5MB.
   
   Please make this a priority.</li>

   I fully agree. 5 mb is a lot for an empty app. </li>

   The app size that you have reported is not accurate, because you have built for debugging and not for distribution. This means that the app has not been streamlined. This will affect the deemed severity of this issue.
   
   Having said that, there are things that we intend to do to reduce the size at some point, so I will accept this ticket to track the progress.</li>

   You're right Paul. I prepared the app for distribution and the application executable is 3.8MB. That's with a blank project (the archive size is 5.5MB). Is there any way to see what modules the titanium compilation found in the code and chose to automatically include in the project?
   
   Just would be eager to see how much space the virtual machine takes compared to the code that gets compiled into the app.
   
   Thanks</li>
