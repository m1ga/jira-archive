<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Expected Behavior</h4>

When we launch an app on iOs 5.0.1, the launch screen disappear after few seconds.

<h4>Actual Behavior</h4>

The app freeze on launching. When we build with the new SDK (1.8.0.1 RC3) the app freeze on device like on iOs 5.0.1. Apple rejected my app for this reason. Indeed since the new build my app freeze.


<h4>Steps to Reproduce</h4>

Work fine on simulator.

* Create a new app
* build it with Titanium 1.8.0.1 RC3
* install on iOs 5.0.1 iPad
* the app hang on launching

   Wilson,
   
   I would request that you reconsider.  I have experienced the same issue ... it is a real issue. 
   
   * Titanium Studio 1.0.7.201112281340
   * SDK Build 1.8.0.1
   * OS: Snow Leopard (10.6.8)
   * xcode 4.2
   * iPad 1 (5.0.1)
   * iPhone 3 (5.0.1)
   
   
   What can I do to help you reproduce?
   
   App.js
   
   <code><pre>
   var win = Ti.UI.createWindow({title:'sandbox',backgroundColor:'white'});
   win.open();
   </pre></code>
   
   Clean Project
   Run on Device

   Tim Alosi is right.
   If someone wants to solve this and cannot repoduce, you may access my laptop via TeamViewer if that helps solving the problem.
   Everything to get this bug gone.</li>

   I had a similar issue, it turned out that it was actually something going wrong during the build.  It was something related to 32 vs 64 bit.  It was fixed in a 1.9.0 CB.  Check your build.log to see if you have any errors.</li>
<li>Tim Alosi 2012-01-21

   Frank Apap ... can you tell us what was wrong ... did a quick review of the build log ... but didn't find anything.
   
   Thanks</li>
<li>Cl√©ment B 2012-01-28

   Frank, by 32 vs 64 bit problems, do you mean the following lines in the build.log :
   
   sh: /Library/Application Support/Titanium/mobilesdk/osx/1.8.0.1/iphone/titanium_prep: Bad CPU type in executable
   
   BTW the problem is fixed in 1.9cb but the 1.9cb sdk is unstable.</li>
<li>Giang Nam Tran 2012-03-19

   Hi GUYS,
   
   I had a similar problem, then I fixed as: update Mobile SDK "mobilesdk-1.8.0.v20111010114849-osx.zip" in "Brach-5062" combo box in master page download: <a href="http://builds.appcelerator.com.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://builds.appcelerator.com.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html.</a>
   
   Could you download ,update that SDK, and try again.Please!
   
   Regards,
   </li>
