<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Problem</h4>

When animating a view's transform, the transform will disappear, or be reset, after the animation completes on Android. It works fine on iOS. 

<h4>Code to Reproduce</h4>

[<a href="http://pastie.org/3059555" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://pastie.org/3059555</a>](<a href="http://pastie.org/3059555)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://pastie.org/3059555)</a>

Just run the code listed there for both Android and iOS. On iOS, the view will animate to the bottom-right, and rotate 60 degrees. On Android, the same thing will happen, but when the animation completes, the rotation goes back to zero. The same thing happens if you apply a <code>scale</code>. All other properties, like <code>left</code>, <code>top</code>, <code>opacity</code>, etc... work fine, only the transform resets on Android. 

I attempted to workaround this by setting the view's transform to the animations transform in the animation's <code>complete</code> event, but there is a very noticable flicker when this happens, very ugly.

   Yeah dude, this is totally ruining my Titanium game development efforts. :)</li>

   Oh ye of little vision! I've got some pretty outside-the-box data visualization ideas actually. :)</li>

   So apparently android animation does NOT affect layouts. In other words, after the view is animated, its params stay untouched. We'll have to apply the transformation ourselves to the view..</li>

   Hieu, I mentioned it above, but just to reiterate, I tried applying the animation's transformation to the view in Javascript inside the animation's <code>complete</code> event. It kinda worked, but there's a _very_ noticeable flicker as it changes transformation.</li>

   The color animation also resets after animation. Test case in TIMOB-11993.</li>

   FYI, this occurs because we re-layout the view at the end of translate (left/right/top etc) animations, and so when we re-lay-it-out then it loses its transform.  And the reason we re-layout is because of *another* bug, namely TIMOB-10042.  So we're in a "6 of one, etc" situation here at the moment.  </li>
