		"description": "h2. Problem\r\n\r\nCurrently the way to check whether the hardware back button has been pressed when an optionDialog has been displayed is verbose. Also, the action of clicking this button means the same as clicking the optionDialog's cancel button, so it would be beneficial to have a more literal event to handle the situation is canceled, regardless of whether that is by using the hardware back button or clicking the cancel button of the optionDialog.\r\n\r\nh2. Request / Solution\r\n\r\nRedevelop \"cancel\" functionality of optionDialog so that it supports new \"cancel\" event instead of \"cancel\" property in \"click\" event, to handle situations where no option is selected.\r\n\r\nh2. Justification\r\n\r\nConvenience and shorter JS code\r\n\r\nThe advantage is that we will be able to do action when both \"cancel\" option is selected and hardware back-button is pressed, and on the other hand in \"click\" event listener we won't have to check if \"cancel\" opinion was clicked to do no action (so, \"cancel\" option would not produce \"click\" event).\r\n",
