<h3>Description</h3>

Currently, iOS' <code>Mimetype.m</code> mimetype processor does not recognize all of the available mimetypes for the device - in particular, it does not identify "mp4" correctly as of mimetype class "video" (or as anything, for that matter).

We need to either upgrade this file to accurately map mimetypes or use internal support from the OS for mimetype ID.

Part of this ticket should be creating a drillbit test to check for valid mimetypes of a subset of common files which the user may be performing operations on.
