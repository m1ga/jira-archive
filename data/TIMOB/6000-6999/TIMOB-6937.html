<h3>Description</h3>

one of the things i would like to see to speed up development and the first run experience is a pre-compile of the dev library so that the first simulator launch is fast.  right now, each new project requires a full compile (with debug settings and all symbols included). 

it would be nice for simulator only (can't use this for test on device or distribute since it will cause all symbols to be used) to be ship a pre-compiled .a/.jar that could be used for dev and fast launch.

   FWIW, in Android, all of our Java code and V8 bindings are currently pre-compiled (to .jar / .so).. The only thing that needs compiling is initial generated Java code from the app and then the Dex process which is an all-or-nothing operation (a .dex archive can't be updated currently using the dx compiler)
