<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Problem</h4>

I write this code to clean built-in remote images cache on sd-card, it works, but if I exit app with back button or with activity.finish(), at the next restart all images in my tableview are broken (empty), like the app don't recognize that cache file is missing.

I need to kill app with task killer to have all works fine again.

<h4>Test case</h4>

<code><pre>
// delete cache files
var dir = Titanium.Filesystem.getFile(Titanium.Filesystem.externalStorageDirectory); 
var cache_folder = dir.nativePath.toString()+'/remote-image-cache';
var deldir = Titanium.Filesystem.getFile(cache_folder); 
deldir.deleteDirectory(true);

// exit app
var activity = Titanium.Android.currentActivity;
activity.finish();
</pre></code> 

Note that there is no issue with manually deleting (from adb shell) all files in <code>/mnt/sdcard/(app folder)/remote-image-cache</code>.

<h4>Workaround</h4>

Titanium fails if dir remote-image-cache isn't found, so inserting a deldir.createDirectory(); after deldir.deleteDirectory(true); can be used as a workaround:

<code><pre>
// delete cache files
var dir = Titanium.Filesystem.getFile(Titanium.Filesystem.externalStorageDirectory); 
var cache_folder = dir.nativePath.toString()+'/remote-image-cache';
var deldir = Titanium.Filesystem.getFile(cache_folder); 
deldir.deleteDirectory(true);
deldir.createDirectory();

// exit app
var activity = Titanium.Android.currentActivity;
activity.finish();
</pre></code>

   well, seems that Titanium fails if dir remote-image-cache isn't found, so a deldir.createDirectory(); after deldir.deleteDirectory(true); can be a workaround.</li>

   Thanks for raising this ticket. Please note my changes, to allow it to be escalated.
   
   Would you mind completing the environment field, in accordance with the [JIRA Ticket Checklist](<a href="https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides/How+to+Submit+a+Bug+Report#HowtoSubmitaBugReport-JIRATicketChecklist)?" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides/How+to+Submit+a+Bug+Report#HowtoSubmitaBugReport-JIRATicketChecklist)?</a> Once this is done, I can move it to the main project.
   
   Thank you</li>

   Done, sorry ;-)</li>

   Thank you, Massimo. No need to apologise. :)
   
   Do you really think it is unreasonable for the app to behave this way? Rather than deleting the directory, have you tried deleting just its contents?
   
   Anyway, I will move this over to the main project, so we can see what our engineering team says.  :)</li>

   Would you verify whether or not this issue is still happening with the latest 1.8.0.1 release?
   
   Thank you</li>

   Sorry, but I'm not near my PC for the next 3 days, so I can't do nothing. I will try it as soon as possible at my return</li>
