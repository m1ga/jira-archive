<h3>Description</h3>

iOS needs to establish code guidelines and a source beautifying tool so that we can begin code cleanup and encourage new people working on the source to follow convention rather than paradigms from other languages or currently incorrect methodologies in the iOS codebase.

We will also eventually want a clang AST plugin to perform tasks such as variable name analysis to ensure that everybody is following the right naming rules (camelcase, trailing underscore in args only, etc.) which could probably be integrated with the API metrics to provide some better information.

   Updated the wiki page with a link to the uncrustify config (as well as instructions on getting brew/uncrustify). The checkin was [tidevtools/648c83a](<a href="https://github.com/billdawson/tidevtools/commit/648c83a70b9f515d5438e5c4eec84bfc1051f245)." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/billdawson/tidevtools/commit/648c83a70b9f515d5438e5c4eec84bfc1051f245).</a></li>
