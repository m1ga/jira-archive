<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>PROBLEM DESCRIPTION</h4>
Customer's console is stucked with the output of a previous run. From the Customer: "for some days now Studio's console shows output from a project I worked on some days ago. When I work on any other project its output will show correctly but often the old output from that other project instantly returns and I can't see the output I need at this moment."

<h4>EXTRA INFO</h4>
I asked the customer to try different workarounds (none of them solved the issue):

1. Press the button marked with the red arrow in the attachment. The one that says "Remove all terminated launches".
2. Run ./studio3 -clean
3. Rename the offending project
4. Remove the offending project
5. Update to the latest version
6. Delete all configurations related to the project

No succes at all.

   Hello,
   the required info (screencast) added in the comment. </li>

   Moved bug to mobile since in talking with Max & Stramer, does not appear to be a Studio issue. Assigning to Max for now, please reassign as necessary.</li>

   It looks like the module used by the app is having weird paths.
   Stephen, ideas ?</li>
<li>Stephen Tramer 2012-01-06

   Do we have the source/project/module available?</li>
