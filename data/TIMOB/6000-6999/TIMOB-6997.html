   This may have the common cause. Vishal tried the fix for 4946 on 6997, and it appeared to have fixed the issue.</li>
<li>Vishal Duggal 2012-01-05

   Confirmed that the fix for TIMOB-4946 also fixes this issue.</li>
<li>Michael Pettiford 2012-01-12

   Closing issue
   
   Tested with Ti Studio 1.9.0.v20120111233134
   Ti Mob SDK 1.8.0.1
   OSX Lion
   iPhone 4S, iPad 2
   
   Expected behavior of no error message is shown</li>
