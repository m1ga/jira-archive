<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Problem</h4>
Xcode build fails for project when directory exists in the Resources directory with same name as project.

This issue *only* occurs for projects with modules.

<h4>Discussion and Workaround</h4>

Q&A: [<a href="http://developer.appcelerator.com/question/119869/ios" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://developer.appcelerator.com/question/119869/ios</a>]

<h4>Steps to reproduce</h4>

1. Create a Titanium mobile project named "NameConflict"
2. Create a directory inside Resources also named "NameConflict"
3. Create a JS file inside of the newly created directory
4. Add a module to the tiapp.xml file and place the module inside the project
5. Try to build... in Xcode 3.2.6 you'll get a "SystemExit: 1" and in Xcode 4.2 you'll get a "SystemExit: 65"

   Just to enforce this report, I've come across the same issue. In fact, it's reproducible even without steps 3 and 4 as described. Just create a new project, create a folder with the same name and hit build; hey presto, a tonne of errors.
   
   Here's my environment:
   
   Titanium Studio, build: 1.0.8.201201262211
   Build: jenkins-titanium-rcp-master-136 (origin/master)</li>

   Titanium does not allow you to create a file or directory with the same name as the app.
   
   This was initially introduced in Titanium SDK 5.4.0.GA (TIMOB-19411). However this did a case-sensitive match. In Titanium SDK 5.5.0, we added a case-insensitive check (TIMOB-23756).</li>
