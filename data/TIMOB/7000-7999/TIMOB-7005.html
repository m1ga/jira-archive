<h3>Description</h3>

Since you're trying to mimic the web environment, mimicking the CSS box model would be a good idea. One of the properties that's currently missing is padding. 

Yes, a workaround is putting views inside views. But it's ridiculously clunky, and doesn't always do what you want anyways. It's one of the things that should just work.

   Sergej
   
   Thanks for raising this request.
   
   To be clear, we are not "trying to mimic the web environment". Titanium aims to provide features that relate directly to their native mobile platform counterparts. As a rule of thumb, if the feature you need is not provided in a core native API, then it is very much less likely to be implemented in the core Titanium API.
   
   That said, you can certainly implement this yourself, by writing a module for each platform (see [Extending Titanium](<a href="https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides/Extending+Titanium))." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides/Extending+Titanium)).</a> If you believe there is a great demand for it from the rest of the developer community, there can be great revenue opportunities if you sell it in [our marketplace](<a href="http://marketplace.appcelerator.com/)." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://marketplace.appcelerator.com/).</a>
   
   Cheers

   While my above advice still stands, I have found a planning document that proposes a <code>margin</code> and <code>padding</code> property for views. Also, ticket TIMOB-6702 exists in the main project (an iOS equivalent will be raised when the work starts).
   
   Therefore, it seems like you may get your wish! Still, I did say, "less likely", didn't I? ;)

   Paul,
   The thing about providing native features instead of "emulating the web environment" is that users don't really care as long as you do at least one of those. Right now you do neither. I know that you're working on a declarative UI-solution but while you work on it we still need to put products to market in order to get revenue.
   
   So please stop dismissing the failings of the platform by telling users to go fix it themselves, some of your users have paid quite large amounts of money for you to deliver a working platform.
   
   Cheers.</li>

   This request is a duplicate of TiMOB-6702. We will implement it for all platforms (Android, iOS and Mobile Web) when we implement it even if this ticket is Android specific.</li>
