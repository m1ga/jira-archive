					"body": "Sergej\r\n\r\nThanks for raising this request.\r\n\r\nTo be clear, we are not \"trying to mimic the web environment\". Titanium aims to provide features that relate directly to their native mobile platform counterparts. As a rule of thumb, if the feature you need is not provided in a core native API, then it is very much less likely to be implemented in the core Titanium API.\r\n\r\nThat said, you can certainly implement this yourself, by writing a module for each platform (see [Extending Titanium|https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides/Extending+Titanium]). If you believe there is a great demand for it from the rest of the developer community, there can be great revenue opportunities if you sell it in [our marketplace|http://marketplace.appcelerator.com/].\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Right now you do neither. I know that you're working on a declarative UI-solution but while you work on it we still need to put products to market in order to get revenue.\r\n\r\nSo please stop dismissing the failings of the platform by telling users to go fix it themselves, some of your users have paid quite large amounts of money for you to deliver a working platform.\r\n\r\nCheers.",
