<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Problem</h4>

Launching app on device using "Run on device" results in error when multiple devices are connected at once.

I have a testbed of Android devices, and it would be nice to just have them all connected all the time (ie for charging purposes). Since adb allows you to get a list of attached devices, it seems that it would be simple enough for Titanium and/or Studio to prompt for a connected device, instead of erroring with the "multiple devices" error, shown below.

<h4>Steps to reproduce</h4>

* create default app
* connect 3 android devices to computer
* run on device
* see resulting error below

<h4>Logs</h4>

The following is an excerpt from the attached <code>build.log</code>

<code><pre>
[DEBUG] Waiting for device to be ready ...
[TRACE] adb devices returned 3 devices/emulators
[DEBUG] Device connected... (waited 0 seconds)
[DEBUG] waited 0.021664 seconds on emulator to get ready
[INFO] Installing application on emulator
[DEBUG] /android-sdk-macosx/platform-tools/adb -d install -r /Users/shan/Dropbox/dev/NEIRA-mobile/build/android/bin/app.apk
[ERROR] error: more than one device
</pre></code>

   Can we bump this up? With the new CLI it seems like now is the time.
   
   I have one additional request, though... If I am doing a Debug run, I should be able to select a device. However, if I'm doing a normal run, I should be able to select one *or* all devices. This will come in handy when using tech like TiShadow.</li>
