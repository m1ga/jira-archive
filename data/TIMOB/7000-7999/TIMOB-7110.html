<h3>Description</h3>

1) Create a new project in Titanium using the default template.

2) Run the default project.

2) Add a new window/tab url ref to the tab group:

var winyack = Titanium.UI.createWindow({ title:'yack',  backgroundColor:'#fff', url:'yack.js' }); 
var tabyack = Titanium.UI.createTab({ icon:'KS_nav_views.png', title:'yack', window:winyack });  
tabGroup.addTab(tabyack);

3) from command line create 'yack.js' in the resources folder 'touch yack.js' 

4) run android simulator

The temporary solution is to "Clean" and then build; however this is a time consuming process and deprecates the development and experience.

   Hi Matt--two questions...1) not sure what the title for this bug should be, and 2) is this a platform issue about deciding when it should re-build? Or should we be cleaning automatically? How would you expect the process to work?</li>
<li>Matt Schmulen 2012-01-07

   yea, Im not sure about the title: how about "Titanium js files not recognized when created outside of file new".
   
   I think its just not picking up the .js file.  I was unsure if it was the Ti sdk that was failing to pick up the new file or if it was Ti Studio failing.  
   
   I think Ti Studio issue.
   
   The correct process should be if I create a js file in a ruble or command line and then hit "run/play" button it should pick it up and not give the red screen of death.  this is a regression, since it worked in the prev configuration.
   
   Thanks Ingo !! </li>

   What configuration did it last work with? The only thing I can think of that would make it a TiStudio issue would be that we may have been cleaning in a case previously where we are no longer doing so (we were being overly agressive about cleaning according to platform).</li>

   Hi Matt--we need confirmation if this is iOS, Android (or both) as the bug isn't clear there. Marshall thinks it may be a platform bug. Does it matter which SDK version you use?</li>
<li>Ingo Muschenetz 2012-01-11

   This appears to be a platform bug. Tested on iOS:
   
   <h4>Follow the steps above, using SDK 1.7.X. It works as expected</h4>
   <h4>Follow the steps above, using SDK 1.8.0.1. It errs out as Matt described.</h4>
   
   As such, I believe something changed in platform re: this behavior. Moving to platform.</li>

   Unable to reproduce the bug as described in 1.9.0.88820ff, TiStudio 1.0.8.201201190907, fastdev enabled.
   
   Steps tested were:
   
   1. Simulator run
   2. touch file
   3. edit app.js
   4a. Simulator run
   4b. Android emulator run
   5b. Simulator run
   
   Two separate tests were performed, one with 4a one with 4b/5b. Android appears to have an issue with this (even after a clean) but this is not the problem described. iPhone Simulator is not affected.</li>

   Verified fix on Matt's setup with custom Ruble and SDK 1.9.0.v20120119103134.</li>
