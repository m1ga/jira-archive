<h3>Description</h3>

When launching the application on the *Android Device*, the console says that the application is installed on the *emulator*. Even though I chose the _Android Device_ Menu.


[DEBUG] Waiting for device to be ready ...
[TRACE] adb devices returned 1 devices/emulators
[DEBUG] Device connected... (waited 0 seconds)
[DEBUG] waited 0.031000 seconds on emulator to get ready
[INFO] Installing application on {color:red}emulator{color}

This message has +no impact+ on the deployment. The application is well deployed on the device, but such a message can lead to some confusion.

   Console also says "installing on device" when app deployed to emulator.</li>

   This is something that needs to be corrected in platform as we do not have control over those messages.</li>
