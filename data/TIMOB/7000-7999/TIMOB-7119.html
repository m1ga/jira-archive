<h3>Description</h3>

If a relative path is passed as the first argument to <code>Ti.Filesystem.getFile(..)</code>, that path is interpreted differently, android vs. iOS:

* In Android, it's relative to the calling context.  So if the <code>getFile</code> is called from within a window with JS url "a/b/c.js", then the path argument to <code>getFile</code> (if relative) is interpreted as being relative to folder "b".

* In iOS, a relative path passed as first argument to <code>getFile</code> is interpreted as being relative to root Resources, no matter which code is calling it.

<h4>Fail Case / Test Case App</h4>

Attached GetFilePath.zip contains app that, when run on Android, will show a graphic on the _second_ window.  On iPhone, it won't show the graphic and you'll see "ERROR Couldn't get image file" in console.

   Based on discussions in today's parity meeting, there seems to be agreement that Android's current behavior is the correct one (paths are relative to the current script). 
   
   I'm changing this to an iOS bug and updating the docs accordingly.
