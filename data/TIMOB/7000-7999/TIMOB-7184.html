<h3>Description</h3>

Currently there is a failure in the drillbit JSS test when run in conjunction with any other tests, even those which do not touch filesystem. The test still passes when the drillbit dir is cleaned and the test is run individually.

This could be any number of things involving JSS file detection or certain types of includes, or simply drillbit screwing with the build system and causing more softlink problems. In any event, the file is *definitely* present in the <code>test_harness</code> build so it's not like it doesn't exist - it's just not being loaded for some reason.
