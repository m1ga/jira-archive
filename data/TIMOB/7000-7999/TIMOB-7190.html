<h3>Description</h3>

Currently there is no way to know what view a <code>Ti.UI.Animation</code> is operating on. So for example, if I want to perform another operation on the target view after the <code>Animation</code> completes, I need to add that reference directly to the <code>Animation</code> manually.

<code><pre>
var view = Ti.UI.createView(/* set view properties */);
var animation = Ti.UI.createAnimation({
    duration: 1000,
    top: 100,
    // I need to add this manually so that I know what view was animated in the upcoming 'complete' event
    view: view
});
animation.addEventListener('complete', function(e) {
    // There is no native property in Ti.UI.Aniamtion, nor the returned event object, that 
    // gives me access to the view being animated. Until this property is added, I'll have to 
    // use the property I added manually.
    e.source.view.backgroundColor = '#f00';
});
view.animate(animation);
</pre></code>

It would be much easier if when <code>view.animate()</code> was called, the <code>Animate</code> object automatically had the appropriate view added to it as a property.

   I don't think this is necessary since the complete event is passed a "source" which would be the view that was animated.
   
   Here's the API docs: <a href="http://developer.appcelerator.com/apidoc/mobile/latest/Titanium.UI.Animation.complete-event.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://developer.appcelerator.com/apidoc/mobile/latest/Titanium.UI.Animation.complete-event.html</a></li>

   In my testing on iOS and Android, <code>e.source</code> returns the <code>Ti.UI.Animation</code>, not the view that is animating.</li>

   Sorry, you're right. That is how it will be in mobile web too.
   
   Perhaps this ticket should be to add a "target" to the Ti.UI.Animation start/complete events that would be the UI element being animated.</li>
