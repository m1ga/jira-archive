<h3>Description</h3>

There are a number of UI widgets that have no native UI and that need some sort of styling. We should have a theme system that allows us to control these UIs.

Themes would follow a common interface, then define specific visual looks and behaviors.

There would be at least one theme, Appcelerator, and we can consider adding platform specific themes (e.g. iOS, WP7, etc).

Each UI widget would not only apply certain CSS classes, but would also read the theme's configuration for specific behavior hints, such as tabs on the top or bottom.

The tiapp.xml would allow the developer to select which theme they wanted to use. The build system would then optimize the project for that theme.

It should also be possible to dynamically serve a specific theme per request based on the type of device connecting.

We will want to use SASS or LESS (<a href="https://gist.github.com/674726)." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://gist.github.com/674726).</a> May also need to use clean-css (<a href="https://github.com/GoalSmashers/clean-css)." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/GoalSmashers/clean-css).</a>

   We would prefer LESS since it is JavaScript based</li>

   @Sehyo We will almost certainly use LESS. :)</li>

   I would recommend doing this in Alloy and using tss. Is there a reason not to? </li>

   @Russell, the point of the theme support is to implement the default look. Because Mobile Web is extremely performance sensitive, I believe a native CSS approach will be more efficient. This theme system is not intended for end developers to use. It's solely for the default look.</li>
