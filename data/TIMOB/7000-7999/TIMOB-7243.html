<h3>Description</h3>

Android and iOS have different and sometimes non-functional UI event listener support.

Using the attached EventTest with the "singletap" event and Ti.UI.Window and Ti.UI.Button UI components,
an accurate behavior matrix is included below as an example, but the overall behavior is similar between all events and UI elements.

Results:

Event Used (for both UI components): singletap

UI Component 1 (used to fire the event): Window

Runtime - Result:

Android V8 - can't re-add event listener
Android Rhino - can't remove event listener
iOS 5.0 - can add and remove event listener (correct behavior)

UI Component 2 (used to fire the event): Button

Runtime - Result:

Android V8 - can add and remove event listener (correct behavior)
Android Rhino - can add and remove event listener (correct behavior)
iOS 5.0 - can't add event listener

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Run attached EventTest project using code-specified (at the top of the file) event and UI component.
2. Observe results.

   I'm looking into the iOS version, but should we split this ticket into two sub-tickets, one for Android's issues, one for iOS's issues?</li>
<li>Blain Hamon 2012-06-21

   Could not reproduce the iOS add inability issue. Was this fixed by TIMOB-7540?</li>
<li>Neeraj Gupta 2012-06-21

   @Blain - I would prefer to mark this ticket as Ti API ticket instead of creating different tickets. </li>
<li>Ping Wang 2012-06-25

   Can not reproduce on Android.</li>
<li>Neeraj Gupta 2012-06-25

   @Ping - you need to compare iOS and Android behavior side by side for all the scenarios described in this ticket before resolving it.</li>

   Closing ticket due to time passed and lack of progress for a number of years. Please open a new ticket if there are any problems.</li>
