<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>The Problem:</h4>
The font of the hintText of a text field changes if the field is a "password field" or if it's a normal field.

<h4>Code sample in app.js</h4>
<code><pre>
var win =  Ti.UI.createWindow({
	backgroundColor:'black'
});

var username = Ti.UI.createTextField({
	top:10,
	left:20,right:20,height:40,
	backgroundColor:'white',
	
	hintText:'hintText for username'
});

var password = Ti.UI.createTextField({
	top:100,
	left:20,right:20,height:40,
	backgroundColor:'white',
	
	passwordMask:true,
	hintText:'hintText for password'
});


win.add(username);
win.add(password);

win.open();
</pre></code>

<h4>Discussion</h4>
As you can see from this example, the only different between the two textFields is the passwordMask. When the application is ran, you'll see that the font is different to the point that one of the texts is longer than the other.

<h4>Workaround</h4>
Setting the fontFamily on a password field doesn't seem to do anything, but setting it on the normal field does work properly. A workaround for now is to set the font family in the normal field as monospace:
<code><pre>
var foo =  Ti.UI.createTextField({
	top:10,
	left:20,right:20,height:40,
	backgroundColor:'white',

	font:{
		fontFamily:'monospace'
	},
	
	hintText:'hintText for username'
});
</pre></code>

   Any updates? This is really ugly. :-(</li>
<li>Michael Gangolf 2013-03-01

   Still wrong on 3.0.2, Android 4.0. hintText won't use fontFamily if its a password field</li>
<li>Sergio Infante Montero 2013-12-11

   This is still happening with:
   Titanium Studio, build: 3.1.3.201309132423
   Build: jenkins-titanium-rcp-master-21 (origin/master)
   Date: 13 September 2013, 00:23:57
   
   and this Devices:
   Nexus 7 1st generation
   Kindle Fire HD 7"
   
   Is there any solution or suggestion?</li>
<li>James R Grinter 2013-12-23

   happens with 3.2.0 RCs too. But that's probably because it's an underlying Android thing going on here.
   
   This StackOverflow thread has some explanation, and it may be possible to follow at least one of those solutions using Titanium (though I didn't have much luck with trying to set fontFamily: 'sans-serif' after - which also seems to vary the font-size from whatever default is in play.)

    Verified the FIXED with:
    
    Appc-Studio:3.3.0.201405011408
    sdk:3.3.0.v20140507163312
    acs:1.0.14
    alloy:1.4.0-dev
    npm:1.3.2
    titanium:3.3.0-dev
    titanium-code-processor:1.1.1
    xcode:5.1.1
    Device:Iphone5s(v7.1.1),Nexus7(v4.4.2)
    
    Font is same for both the textField normal as well as passwordMask.
    Hence Closing the issue as working as expected.</li>
