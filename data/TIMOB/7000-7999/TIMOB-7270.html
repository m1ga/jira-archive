<h3>Description</h3>

A useful data point is to find out what classes and modules fall under heavy use and which don't. During the build process for iOS, this information is indirectly gleaned in generating USE_TI_ compiler flags. If Titanium Studio could relay this information back to the cloud, we could have a better idea on what classes we could safely remove or which classes has the best ROI in terms of code fixes.

   Also, this probably will require changes on cloud and tools, as well.</li>
<li>Chris Barber 2016-08-22

   We added support for this for iOS and Android in TiSDK 3.2.0.</li>

   Closing ticket as fixed.</li>
