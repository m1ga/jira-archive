<h3>Description</h3>

<<Note this issue relates to TIMOB-5026 except that issue has been fixed for building for device, this issue strictly relates to iOS simulators>>

Steps to reproduce:
1. Install an iOS module into the application's folder by placing the module's zip file in the application folder (e.g. ti.bump-iphone-1.0.zip)
2. Build the application for iOS Simulator (e.g. iPhone simulator)
3. Navigate to the 'build/iphone/build/Debug-iphonesimulator' (or other target) folder for the application
4. Right-click on the application package and select "Show Package Contents"

Actual result:
If this issue hasn't been fixed there will be a module directory for the module you tested (i.e. ti.bump)

Expected result:
The module directory will not be included at the location specified above

   I'm not entirely sure what the issue is here. As this is not about the device, issues of app size is not of concern. I don't see how these extraneous folders impact the functionality of testing of the application. Not even Apple is concerned with the authenticity of the simulator versus device, so I'm tempted to propose this one be resolved as 'won't fix'. We have larger fires to put out.</li>

   This is strictly a side effect of 'symlink for simulator' which is a problem that must be resolved.</li>

   This bug still occurs:
   Titanium Studio, build: 2.1.2.201208201549
   Titanium SDK: 2.1.2.v20120824144611
   OS: OS X 10.8 (Mountain Lion)
   Device Tested: Iphone Simulator. (5.1)
   </li>

   In Titanium SDK 3.0.0, the iOS build was completely re-written and no longer has this behavior.
   
   iOS module assets are copied into <code>build/iphone/build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/&lt;appname&gt;.app/modules/&lt;module id&gt;</code>. iOS module resources are copied into <code>build/iphone/build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/&lt;appname&gt;.app</code>. It is possible for a module resource to overwrite an application's resource file or a previously processed resource.
   
   If the asset or resource is an image and <code>&lt;use-app-thinning&gt;true&lt;/use-app-thinning&gt;</code> is in the <code>&lt;ios&gt;</code> section of the <code>tiapp.xml</code>, then the images are copied directly into a dynamically generated asset catalog image set. For example, if the module's <code>assets</code> directory only contains images, then it will not create the <code>build/iphone/build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/&lt;appname&gt;.app/modules/&lt;module id&gt;</code> directory.
   
   It's worth noting that all iOS apps will most likely have a <code>modules</code> directory because if they use anything in <code>Ti.UI</code>, it copies in the default images: badge, close button, and default photo (in case the ImageView's image fails to load).</li>

   Closing ticket as the issue cannot be reproduced.</li>
