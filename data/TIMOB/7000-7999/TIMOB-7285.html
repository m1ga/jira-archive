   What MobileSDK version was this built against?</li>
<li>Ingo Muschenetz 2011-12-14

   Marshall, Max thinks this might be a platform bug. If not, can you re-assign back?</li>
<li>Ingo Muschenetz 2012-01-18

   Cloned across as this might be a mobile issue (or a Studio + mobile), but it needs to be addressed.</li>

   kpomaski - can you please verify this issue with the latest build?</li>
<li>Bill Dawson 2012-01-25

   FWIW, couldn't reproduce today in master.  I have Titanium Studio 1.0.7.201112281340, however (slightly newer than the reporter's.)</li>

   BTW worked fine with V8 and Rhino debuggers.</li>

   See previous comments.</li>

   closing as we are not able to reproduce using master (Feb 9 2012 09:46 rd47ce8a4)</li>

   The issue still occurs. See TISTUD-1044.
   Also stumble into it one, but no reproduction steps for now unfortunately. </li>
<li>Shalom Gibly 2012-05-14

    Closing it again. We will try to resolve it on the Studio side (TISTUD-1044). At least avoid that situation.</li>
