<h3>Description</h3>

In order to correctly deprecate (and remove) <code>Ti.Network.TCPSocket</code> which has been deprecated since the introduction of better sockets in 1.7.0, without disrupting the ability to use these features, the Bonjour code needs to be updated to take <code>Ti.Network.Socket.TCP</code> objects. This should not be a difficult task, although we will need to make developers aware of the change prior to release.

   This ticket should be resolved at the same time as TIMOB-4662.</li>

   Almost 1 year... still no solution?</li>

   There has been (so far) very little demand for this change which is why it has not been prioritized higher. Is there a reason you need this?</li>
<li>Thierry Ruiz 2014-02-14

   The reason is simple and pretty straight forward. Without a fix, I don't see how Ti.Network.BonjourService can work.
   
   Titanium.Network.BonjourService.publish() take a Titanium.Network.TCPSocket as a parameter, which has been dropped a while ago and replaced by Titanium.Network.Socket.TCP
   
   Titanium.Network.BonjourService is totally dead/not functional without that fix. It's impossible to publish a service through that way.
   It needs to be updated to handle Titanium.Network.Socket.TCP for his publish() method. Otherwise it's pointless to keep that framework in that state in Titanium SDK.
   
   So I see different scenario:
   1. Leave it like this forever and/or drop the entire BonjourService and BonjourBrowser
   2. Do that fix in order to handle Titanium.Network.Socket.TCP
   3. Suggest a work around or an alternative to publish BonjourServices through Titanium (3rd part module or else)
