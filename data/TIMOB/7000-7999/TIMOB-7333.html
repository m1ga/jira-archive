<h3>Description</h3>

Related to TISTUD-998, right now in Studio you can select (some of) the properties of an AVD (Run->Run Configurations->Titanium Android Emulator) but this isn't configurable enough for some cases (although you can modify an AVD created by Studio in the <code>android</code> tools, as long as it has the right name). It would be nice to have the feature to select a pre-existing AVD in the run configurations, so that you can use an existing AVD without having Studio create a new one for you.

It appears to require build script modifications allowing for the specification of an arbitrary AVD.

   To functional test this fix, try sending a name of a pre-existing AVD to builder.py after the app id.
   
   (fill in your own values for project-name, etc)
   <code><pre>
   $ mobilesdk/osx/2.0.0/android/builder.py emulator &lt;project-name&gt; &lt;android-sdk&gt; &lt;project-dir&gt; &lt;project-id&gt; &lt;avd-name&gt;
   </pre></code>
   
   This should result in the provided avd to be launched.
