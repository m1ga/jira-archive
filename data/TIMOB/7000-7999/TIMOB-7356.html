<h3>Description</h3>

While using Studio 1.0.7 we started noticing the occasional first attempt to build iOS projects failing and the following text in console:
[INFO] One moment, building ...
[INFO] Detected missing project but that's OK. re-creating it...

This condition is caused by a lack of a build/iphone folder in the project which prompts the message from builder.py. The missing folder is created, and the second attempt should rebuild. We have not seen this error prior to 1.0.7. The only way I have been able to reproduce this situation so far is by importing a project and trying to build. This project presumably had no build/iphone directory

builder.py snippet starting at line 655:
<code><pre>
<h4>starting in 1.4, you don't need to actually keep the build/iphone directory</h4>
<h4>if we don't find it, we'll just simply re-generate it</h4>
if not os.path.exists(iphone_dir):
	from iphone import IPhone
	print "[INFO] Detected missing project but that's OK. re-creating it..."
	iphone_creator = IPhone(name,appid)
	iphone_creator.create(iphone_dir,True)
	sys.stdout.flush()
</pre></code>

Steps to reproduce:
1) Import a project into Studio with no build/iPhone folder
2) Attempt to run in simulator

Result:
Build fails with error in the console

Expected:
If missing a folder, make it and build

   Eric, does this happen with SDK 1.7.x?</li>
<li>Thomas Huelbert 2011-12-14

   as discussed, please check if this is an sdk issue, and if it is move it to timob. thanks!</li>
<li>Eric Merriman  2012-01-10

   This occurs when using SDK 1.7.5 as well. </li>

   If not possible to rebuild after recreating the folder, perhaps we should move this to tooling to allow for more robust error reporting.</li>

   Marshall, this bug has been moved from TISTUD, and the auto-assign feature left it with me. Assigning to you for relegation.</li>
