   Seems like this is a studio, and not timob, bug.</li>
<li>Neeraj Gupta 2012-01-24

   It was working earlier with the same Studio version so it may be a JSCA issue.</li>
<li>Bill Dawson 2012-01-25

   Per Wilson, git hash for is 7f46286, so I'll be building and testing with that on my machine.</li>
<li>Bill Dawson 2012-01-25

   Cannot reproduce.  Works fine for me using build hash 7f46286.  But I'm using Titanium Studio 1.0.7.201112281340.  I'm not sure how to get the same version of Titanium Studio as Wilson.
   
   Here's how i tested:
   
   * I checked out, built and released 7f46286.
   
   * I verified that the resulting 1.8.1 folder indeed contained the "api.jsca" file, which is what Code Assist uses.
   
   * I opened Titanium Studio.
   
   * I created a wholly new project (no special templates) targeting 1.8.1 and just iPhone.
   
   * I opened Resources/app.js in the editor within Titanium Studio.
   
   * I typed "Ti." and immediately Code Assist popped up as expected.

   The Titanium Studio version I used for testing was from the RC path: <a href="http://preview.appcelerator.com/appcelerator/studio/standalone/update/rc/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://preview.appcelerator.com/appcelerator/studio/standalone/update/rc/</a></li>

   Note that if content assist works in one SDK and not another, that can't be a Studio issue (i.e. works in 1.8.0.1 and 1.9, but not in 1.8.1)</li>
<li>Eric Merriman  2012-01-25

   Some additional info: Since switching SDKs in Tiapp causes a clean and therefore a reindexing of the JSCA file, we will try to see if this is interfering with our trying to get reproducible case on this. We have seen this not work, and then switching off and then back to the same SDK, the problem was not reproducible anymore.</li>
<li>Ingo Muschenetz 2012-01-25

   My guess is that it could be related to something like the attached ticket, where indexing is confused. Cleaning the project should fix it, if that's the case.</li>
<li>Bill Dawson 2012-01-25

   The only thing we do is plop api.jsca into the root folder of the sdk.  It's there, I checked.  Anything beyond that is beyond me.</li>
<li>Eric Merriman  2012-01-25

    We have some additional info. On two systems with SDK: 1.8.1.v20120124200134
    Titanium Studio, build: 1.0.8.201201210622 we tried "Ti." and got the expected content assist content. Then we cleaned the project (with the file still open and active) and tried content assist again and got nothing. Not sure if this is related or not.</li>
<li>Ingo Muschenetz 2012-01-25

    Eric, when CA fails, can you report back the following:
    
    <h4>What does your Studio log file say?</h4>
    <h4>Open up Window > Show View > Other > Index View, and make sure the project in question is selected. The Index View should show "Ti" on Window as a property of type Titanium, if all is working correctly.</h4></li>
<li>Ingo Muschenetz 2012-01-25

    Do you guys have Project > Build automatically off?</li>
<li>Bill Dawson 2012-01-25

    By the way, are those builds coming from the build server or were they hand-made for you by one of the platform engineers?  I only checked the build server's version of 7f46286, and it indeed has api.jsca.  When we hand-build, we have to the option to _not_ build the api.jsca (since it makes our builds take longer).  So if someone hand built it for you, there's the chance that api.jsca is not in there.
    
    Of course, in that case, it shouldn't have worked pre-cleaning either.</li>
<li>Wilson Luu 2012-01-25

    @Bill 
    The builds we get are from the build server. Not hand-made from platform engineers.
    
    @Ingo
    With Build Automatically off, I was able to repo the bug consistently:
    1. Switch SDK build in tiapp and save file
    2. In .js file, type Ti
    
    However, with Build Automatically on, this bug does not appear.</li>
