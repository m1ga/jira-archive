<h3>Description</h3>

This is a blocker issue for TISTUD-623.

"When a run/debug configuration is created, we need the ability to pass additional command-line arguments to the android emulator. Specifically, the -scale argument in order to use skins whose full scale causes them to be larger than the screen you are running on. For example, I am using the Motorola MD860 skin for the Atrix 4G whose screen is 960 pixels high. The resulting emulator window is some 1200 pixels high but my screen is only 900 pixels high. If you run the AVD from the AVD Manager, it offers the option to run with a particular screen size which uses the -scale argument. We need the capability to do this in Studio. I would recommend simply adding an extensible option to specify any additional command line arguments. The standard Eclipse launch configurator allows this on the configuration's Target tab but that appears to be disabled in Studio."

I believe we are not allowed to pass arbitrary arguments to the emulator. I could not find a duplicate issue, but if one exists, please mark this as such.

   To functional test this fix, try sending additional arguments to the end of builder.py when the <code>emulator</code> comand is used.
   
   This story mentions being able to use the "-scale" argument, so this command would test using 50% scale (fill in your own values for project-name, etc)
   <code><pre>
   $ mobilesdk/osx/2.0.0/android/builder.py emulator &lt;project-name&gt; &lt;android-sdk&gt; &lt;project-dir&gt; &lt;project-id&gt; 7 HVGA -scale 0.5
   </pre></code>
   
   This should result in a tiny emulator window
