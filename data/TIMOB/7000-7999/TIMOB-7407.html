<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>PROBLEM DESCRIPTION</h4>
Some people are interested in being able to set the user-agent for the webview, just like the way we do with the HTTPClient. The usage will be similar to the HTTPClient's modification of the user-agent, but will allow more developers to connect webviews to special content, like twitter that recently doesn't allow you to create a webview of a timeline from our implementation (looks like they identify the agent as mobile, but since doesn't know which one is, it just breaks).

I have seen this request often in the community.
