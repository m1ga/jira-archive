					"body": "I've been playing with this now for a while on 2 devices and 1 emulator:\r\n\r\nDevice 1:\r\nModel: T-Mobile G-Slate\r\nAndroid: 3.1\r\n\r\nDevice 2:\r\nModel: HTC Desire\r\nAndroid: 2.2\r\n\r\nEmulator:\r\nAndroid 2.2\r\n\r\nI've been using our master branch (hash 6249fc07), and also 1.8.0.1 for comparison purposes.  To me it seems like the behavior is already _much_ improved in master, and indeed there have been fairly recent Sound-related changes.\r\n\r\nHowever, it's still not \"perfect\", but the behavior is basically the same as what I see in a native (non-Titanium) Android application that I built for comparison purposes.  With this test Titanium app (and my native Android app which follows the same idea), memory will fairly quickly run out and kill the media player.\r\n\r\nThat's because this test app -- at least for Android -- is pretty crazy.  Each time you click a button, an entirely new [Android MediaPlayer|http://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/MediaPlayer.html] instance is created and prepared (because our {{createSound}} is called each time), without any of the previous ones being {{release}}'d.  This is madness (in Android, anyway), and hopefully not a real-world way that someone is writing an app.  If it works fine in iOS, then maybe iOS has a lighter-weight way (or simply better performing, less memory-eating way) of playing sounds: meaning, better than Android's MediaPlayer.\r\n\r\nIn a real app, I would hope our Sound proxy instances would be re-used rather than re-created every time.\r\n\r\nAnyway: @DUSTIN, can you run some tests against master (1.9.0) and see if the behavior is indeed better, as I described?  If so, I think you would probably want to close this.  I've spent a long time examining our code and comparing it to a native Android app's similar code, and I don't believe we're doing anything different than would be expected.",
