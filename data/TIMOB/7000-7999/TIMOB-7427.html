When launching the simulator via studio then relaunching the simulator for the same project, the simulator will exit prior to loading the app. The home menu is briefly displayed and then the console reports:
[INFO] Application has exited from Simulator

Steps to reproduce:
1) Create a new sample project with Studio 1.0.8 and SDK 1.8.1.v20120125154634

3) When simulator loads, run in simulator again

Result:
Simulator launch fails.

Expected:
Simulator launches without error

Notes:
Does not occur with SDK 1.8.1.v20120124200134
Does not occur if the simulator is killed via studio prior to second launch
