<h3>Description</h3>

Description:
While testing Kitchensink, in the sound_remote_url.js test, I noticed that the "stop" button was pausing the sound. A subsequent press on the "play" button resumed the sound where it had stopped. According to the API docs, sound.stop is supposed to stop the sound then reset it to the beginning of the sound file.  sound.pause (which is also included on a button in the test) should pause the sound, but in this case acts the same as the button executing the sound.stop.

Steps to reproduce:
1) Install KS built with 1.8.1
2) Navigate to Phone> Sound> remote URL and launch test
3) Click "Play" to begin playback
4) Click "stop" to stop playback
5) Click "play" again

Result:
Sound file resumes playback where it was stopped.

Expected:
Sound file plays from the beginning

Notes:
Also occurs with 1.8.0.1
