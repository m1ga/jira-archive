<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Expected:</h4>

setValue() would let you set the selected value of a picker, and getValue() would return the current value. These would work with any picker type.

<h4>Actual:</h4>

setValue/getValue don't exist on Android. And they accept/return only Date types. Thus they will work with only date pickers.

<h4>More</h4>

There are a couple of components to this:

* Parity: these should exist on both iOS & Android
* The names should match the purpose. Maybe the method should be named setDateValue() instead of setValue() ?? Or maybe we need separate methods?
* APIdocs will need to be updated to match the final implementation

Perhaps this is multiple bugs? Perhaps a Parity rather than a Bug ticket? Advise and I'll edit the ticket as appropriate.

   I love how you guys ignore a ticket for years, then close it for "inactivity." Great way to have a clean backlog I guess.</li>

   Hi [~acvauctions] there has been no progress on this ticket for 5 and a half years, I thought that the best way for this issue to be noticed, if it is still an issue, would be to raise a new ticket for it. If no one has even looked at it since January 2012 then its hardly likely anyone is going to look at it in August 2017. I am only doing my job here but if you would like the ticket reopened then let me know and I'd be happy to do so.</li>
