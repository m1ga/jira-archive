<h3>Description</h3>

Trying to dynamically set the opacity of views is not currently working on Android.  I was working on the following sample, which works fine on iOS, but fails on Android.  The expected behavior is that I should be able to dynamically set the "opacity" property on views on this "stoplight" widget.  Instead, once I set the opacity of the views to 1 (from 0.2), the opacity of the views always stays at 1, regardless of what I set them to.
