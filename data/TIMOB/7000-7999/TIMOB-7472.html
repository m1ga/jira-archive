<h3>Description</h3>

It looks like we're including both the Rhino js.jar (via classes.dex) and the 2 V8 ABI-specific shared libraries (libkroll-v8.so, libstlport_shared.so) regardless of which runtime was chosen for the application in the tiapp.xml. We should only bundle the runtime that is given by the <code>ti.android.runtime</code> property in the tiapp.xml, or only bundle V8 by default.

For V8 we should still be bundling both ABI-specific variations of the libraries in <code>armeabi</code> and <code>armeabi-v7a</code> folders.

   We should probably provide an option to the developers to chose a specific ABI version if they know their target devices. By default, we should include both.</li>

   Created TIMOB-7474 to adding an ABI option.</li>
<li>KT 2012-01-31

   Would it not be possible to reduce deployed .apk size further by providing the option to only use the armeabi libraries?  Maybe I don't understand the issues, of course -- but I was under the impression that the main thing you'd be giving up would be FPU support.  For apps that don't depend much on FPU support, there would be a substantial space savings.
   
   Or do I have this completely wrong?</li>

   @KT I opened TIMOB-7474 to add an option for selecting which ABIs to support in your APK.</li>
<li>Josh Roesslein 2012-02-06

   KT, in the Q/A ticket you said the Rhino library was getting included into the final APK's dex file.
   I tried reproducing this against the latest master by creating a deployment APK. Using dexdump I don't see
   any of the Rhino classes being included when using V8 runtime.
   
   Could you verify this issue still occurs and if so any details I could use to reproduce it?
   
   Thanks,</li>

   Fail test case:
   
   1. Select Rhino runtime.
   2. Package application into APK (deploy).
   3. unzip -l the APK
   
   Actual: The lib/ folder contains libkroll-v8 native libraries.
   
   Expected: No native libraries should be found in the lib/ folder.</li>
<li>KT 2012-02-06

   Yeah, I think I may have been wrong on that one.  It may be that the V8 libraries are getting included regardless, but Rhino also only gets included (appropriately) for a Rhino build.</li>

   Verified fixed with SDK 1.9.0.v20120207000134 using rhino packaged APKs. </li>
