<h3>Description</h3>

Description:
WHile testing packaging with our pre-created Studio projects, I noticed that the first attempt to package failed with an error. This occurred regardless of using "project clean". The second attempt was successful and all further attempts. THis could be related to the test projects being put in the GIT repo with no "build" folder.

Studio error log:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/eric/Library/Application Support/Titanium/mobilesdk/osx/1.8.0.1/iphone/builder.py", line 1523, in <module>
    main(sys.argv)
  File "/Users/eric/Library/Application Support/Titanium/mobilesdk/osx/1.8.0.1/iphone/builder.py", line 661, in main
    iphone_creator.create(iphone_dir,True)
  File "/Users/eric/Library/Application Support/Titanium/mobilesdk/osx/1.8.0.1/iphone/iphone.py", line 46, in create
    tiapp = TiAppXML(os.path.join(project_dir,'tiapp.xml'))
  File "/Users/eric/Library/Application Support/Titanium/mobilesdk/osx/1.8.0.1/iphone/../tiapp.py", line 52, in __init__
    data = codecs.open(self.file,'r','utf-8','replace')
  File "/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/codecs.py", line 881, in open
    file = __builtin__.open(filename, mode, buffering)
IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: u'/Users/eric/iconTestUniversal copy/build/iphone/tiapp.xml'

Steps to reproduce:
1) Clone git repo: "titanum_mobile_tests_internal"
2) Import project "feature test/Packaging/IconTestUniversal"
3) Attempt to package for distribution (ad-hoc or distribution)

Result:
Packaging failure

Expected:
Packaging succeeds without error

Notes:
Occurs in 1.8.0.1 with the same Project.
Does not occur with default project created with Studio
Did not occur with KS sample imported into studio

Workaround:
Attempt to package again. The first attempt fixes the problem, and the second attempt succeeds.

   Verified fixed with project with no build folder present using SDK 1.9.0.v20120206101634 using both Ad-hoc and regular distribution provisioning.</li>
