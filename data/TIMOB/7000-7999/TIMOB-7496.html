<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Problem</h4>

For consistency and parity, we need to decide how we should display numbers by default in the UI across all platforms. For example, the <code>toString()</code> method has always been necessary on Android when displaying a Number type that is an integer in a Label, to prevent it displaying as a float. iOS, on the other hand, displays it as an integer.

We should test all UI modules that are able to display text (for example, <code>AlertDialog</code>, <code>TextField</code>, <code>OptionDialog</code>) with an aim of making them consistent.

<h4>Test case</h4>

The code below returns these results:
* Android displays 324.0
* iOS displays 324

Note that the <code>Ti.API.info()</code> statement confirms that <code>label.text</code> is a Number type on Android and iOS.

<code><pre>
var win = Ti.UI.createWindow({
	backgroundColor: 'white',
	fullscreen: false
});

var bigNumber = 324;
var label = Ti.UI.createLabel({
	backgroundColor:'green',
	text: bigNumber,
	textAlign: 'center'
});

win.add(label);
win.open();
Ti.API.info('Label.text is type: '+typeof(label.text));
</pre></code>

   It would be great if we can wrap up one of the last major parity issues in 3.2</li>

   Few quick comments. 
   
   There is no typeof method, it's just an operator. Wrapping parens around it works fine, but it's superfluous. It's like doing 
   <code><pre>
   3 + (4)
   </pre></code>
   It's better to do typeof label.text instead of typeof(label.txt)
   
   As far as the point at hand, I wonder if this is actually a parity bug in our code, or just a difference in V8 and JSCore.</li>
