Default Value: true

Controls the display both horizontal and vertical scrollbars.  There is no mechanism for controlling a specific axis.

   According to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/849225/iphone-is-it-possible-to-hide-native-scrollbar-in-uiwebview" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/849225/iphone-is-it-possible-to-hide-native-scrollbar-in-uiwebview</a> , we can hide/show scrollbar in iOS uiwebview like this:
   [(UIScrollView*)[webview.subviews objectAtIndex:0] setShowsHorizontalScrollIndicator:NO];
   [(UIScrollView*)[webview.subviews objectAtIndex:0] setShowsVerticalScrollIndicator:NO];
   
   this code works in iOS 4.0 - 5.0, but not in iOS 3.1.3. In iOS 4.0-5.0 [webview.subviews objectAtIndex:0] returns instance of _UIWebViewScrollView, which can be casted to UIScrollView, but in iOS 3.1.3 it returns instance of UIScroller, which failed to cast to UIScrollView.

   webView.setScrollBarStyle(View.SCROLLBARS_INSIDE_OVERLAY);

   is it planned to add this to android/ios?
   would be nice to disable the scrollviews. I've disabled scrolling and touch but it still displays the scrollbars for a second when the webview is created. Hiding them would help</li>
