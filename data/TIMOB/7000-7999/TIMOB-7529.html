   IMHO, "addTab" method should not accept Label as parameter, as it's name says it should accept Tab, so crash should be expected behavior.</li>

   We may want to look into why the Java exception wasn't caught and converted to a JS exception (and error dialog).
   The application shouldn't be crashing from Java exceptions thrown during a Kroll method call.
   
   Also adding proxy type validation (instanceof) in the Kroll layer may be worth looking into.
   This way the Java method is always called with the correct type and invalid types of objects
   are caught early while still in the Kroll layer.</li>

   This is an application bug and not a platform issue.</li>
