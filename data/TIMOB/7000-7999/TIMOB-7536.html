   updated... this was through the command line not the Ti Studio interface ( My bad I forgot about the Titanium Studio create Module interface).  I updated the ticket to trivial.</li>

   The <code>TITANIUM_SDK</code> variable is set to an absolute path to the Titanium SDK where ever it's located.
   
   Setting the <code>TITANIUM_SDK</code> relative to the user's home directory means that the SDK can only live in a directory down the user's home directory. I don't see this being a positive change.
   
   The best solution would be to set the <code>TITANIUM_SDK</code> path to an environment variable containing the full path. This env variable would be set by the module build script. I've created TIMOB-23811 to address this.</li>
