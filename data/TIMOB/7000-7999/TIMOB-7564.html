<h3>Description</h3>

User should be able to run the app directly on real iOS device from inside the Titanium Studio.
Current procedure involve creating a binary for iTunes and then use Xcode (set up with the correct provisioning profile and certificates) to actually run the app on the device, making it a long procedure.

   Titanium SDK 3.0.0 debuted the new iOS build which greatly improved provisioning profile and certificate validation, but it wasn't until 3.2.0 that we had installing iOS apps directly to device. It's safe to say this issue has been fixed.</li>
