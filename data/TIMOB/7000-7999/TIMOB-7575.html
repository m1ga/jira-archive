   I've seen this error pop up if there is a version prior to Desktop 1.2.0.RC2 on a machine; what are all of the versions of Desktop you have installed? You may just need to nuke all of them and reinstall.</li>

   I verified that the only desktop sdk's that I have are 1.2.0.RC3 and retested, but I am encountering the same error.
   
   Also, I checked both /Users path and just root</li>

   You may actually need RC4; I'm not sure if RC3 worked. If you're running Lion you'll also need the install in <code>$HOME/Library/Application Support/Titanium</code>. I'm not sure if Titanium Studio pulls down the right versions of Desktop or not.</li>

   As per mpettiford, going to mark WON'TFIX since it's an issue that can be easily worked around (click 'cancel' on the dialog) and is almost certainly an obtuse Desktop bug.</li>

   Closing ticket as the issue will not fix.</li>
