<h3>Description</h3>

The iOS event includes the values "index" and "map".

The Android event omits those but includes "subtitle," "latitude" and "longitude."

   Also, note that the "clicksource" on iOS returns "rightButton" or "rightView," (I believe, although I've mostly seen "rightButton") while Android returns "rightPane" (and possibly in some circumstances "rightButton", but haven't seen that in testing.
   
   I thought there was another bug filed for this, but I can't find it. </li>

   Closing ticket due to time passed and lack of progress in the past few years. Any problems, please file a new ticket.</li>
