<h3>Description</h3>

When running with scalingMode === VIDEO_SCALING_ASPECT_FILL, the video player content does not respect the <code>width</code> value set on the control, but scales to fit the height of the video player while maintaining aspect ratio, overflowing the sides of the control. In this mode, neither background color or border settings appears to be respected.

When running with scalingMode === VIDEO_SCALING_MODE_FILL, the entire video player area is used, and no borders are visible. I believe the video view should be accounting for the width of the borders, here. 

Finally, when running with scalingMode === VIDEO_SCALING_ASPECT_FIT with a square view and a wide-screen video clip, the borders are drawn everywhere except the edges of the picture, where the video overwrites the border.

On iOS, if borderRadius is specified, the corners are also clipped to fit the radius. Will open a separate ticket for this as it may be a bigger can of worms.

Expected behavior: video should be clipped such that the borders are visible.

Test case:

<code><pre>
var vidWin = Titanium.UI.createWindow({
	title : 'Video View Test',
	backgroundColor : '#fff'
});

var activeMovie = Titanium.Media.createVideoPlayer({
	top : 0,
	autoplay : true,
	backgroundColor : 'red',
	height : 300,
	width : 300,
	borderRadius : 20,
	borderWidth : 2,
	borderColor : 'blue',
	mediaControlStyle : Titanium.Media.VIDEO_CONTROL_EMBEDDED,
	scalingMode : Titanium.Media.VIDEO_SCALING_ASPECT_FILL
});

activeMovie.url = 'movie.mp4';
if(activeMovie.fullscreen === true) {
	activeMovie.show();
} else {
	vidWin.add(activeMovie);
}

vidWin.open();
</pre></code>

Note that when running this on Android, the video fills the width of the screen instead of being cropped to the width of the view (although, oddly, the on-screen video controls appear to be cropped to the width of the view). 

On iOS, the video is cropped to a rounded square, with a blue border. 

Swap in the other scaling modes to try the other effects.

   The problem with VIDEO_SCALING_ASPECT_FILL is apparent in SDK 3.2.3 as well.  VideoPlayer needs to respect it's given boundries when fullscreen is false.</li>
