   The only thing you can do to somewhat limit which iOS version is to set the <code>&lt;min-ios-ver&gt;</code> setting in the <code>&lt;ios&gt;</code> section of the <code>tiapp.xml</code>. There's no way to limit the maximum iOS version.
   
   You can set <code>UIRequiredDeviceCapabilities</code> in the <code>Info.plist</code> to require features that can limit the devices you app runs on by requiring features such as "bluetooth-le". This won't guarantee a certain iOS version and it's up to the developer to figure out the possibilities.</li>
