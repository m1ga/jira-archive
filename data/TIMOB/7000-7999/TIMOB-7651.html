<h3>Description</h3>

On iOS, the Tab.close() method takes two arguments: 

- a required Window argument (the window to close)
- an optional options dict (close options)

On Android and Mobile Web, close() only takes the second argument. So:

myTab.close(window) 

Fails on Android, and:

myTab.close()

Fails on iOS.

As an additional complication, however, I believe tab.close() is mostly used on iOS, so the tab group can track which window is open. On Android and MobileWeb, applications can achieve the same ends by calling window.close() directly.
