<h3>Description</h3>

Based on ticket TISTUD-1180, it seems odd that Titanium Studio knows how to "clean" a build, especially since it doesn't know how to do the build itself. From here: <a href="https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides/Titanium+Command+Line+Interface" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides/Titanium+Command+Line+Interface</a>, it seems that a "titanium clean --platform=p1,p2" command (or if omitted, cleans all platforms) would be good, as then Studio does not need to internalize a very platform-specific function.

   It looks like TiStudio has address this in the IDE already since TISTUD-1180 was closed out. Moving this out of the release since it looks as though the platform support is no longer necessary.
   
   @Ingo Let me know if I'm moving this out in error</li>

   TiStudio can clean already, but the point for the ticket was that it was odd Studio had to know how to clean a build, when it doesn't know how to do the build itself. It feels cleaner if it tells each platform to perform the clean rather than Studio knowing to delete a specific set of folders.
   
   Once platform has this support in place, we can then replace our hack with the more proper version.</li>

   I do want to bring attention to this suggestion from Chris: running git clean on projects who are managed by git, rather than deleting the folders. Thoughts? TISTUD-869. We could do git clean on projects that are managed by git, and fall back to the platform behavior otherwise.</li>

   @Ingo I agree that TiStudio shouldn't require a hack (or care about how to clean the mobile project), I mainly moved it out of 2.0.0 for priority reasons. I'll add the tbs-2.1.0 tag so we make sure to schedule this in the next release.</li>

   To test this fix, run the titanium.py script from the project folder from which you are cleaning as follows,
   <code><pre>
   titanium.py clean --platform=p1,p2
   </pre></code>
   And put which platform(s) that needs to be cleaned as a list to the right of the equals.
   
   You can also call it this way,
   <code><pre>
   titanium.py clean
   </pre></code>
   This way will clean out all platform folders.</li>
