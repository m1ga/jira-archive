<h3>Description</h3>

Description:
While building some test projects, Studio reported the following:
[INFO] Performing clean build
[INFO] Installing application in iTunes ... one moment
[DEBUG] executing command: /Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/usr/bin/PackageApplication /Users/eric/Documents/fromGit/titanium_mobile_tests_internal/FeatureTest/OrientationModes/all/build/iphone/build/Debug-iphoneos/all.app
/Users/eric/Library/Application Support/Titanium/mobilesdk/osx/1.8.2.v20120214163156/iphone/itunes_sync.scpt: execution error: Can't make name of 3 into type Unicode text. (-1700)
[INFO] iTunes sync initiated

The build seemed to complete, and the application was placed in iTunes as expected.

A quick check of the iTunes_sync.scpt shows a suspect line:
log "The device " & name of n & " was unable to sync (" & errorStr & ":" & errorNumber & ")"

When changing the line to include "name of source n", the error went away. (Kudos to Blain for the suggestion)

Also, without the iPod hooked up, the error was not presented.


Steps to reproduce:
1) Create a sample project using Studio 1.0.9
2) Attach an iPod for use in testing
3) Build the project for device using SDK 1.8.2

Result:
Error reported in Studio

Expected:
No errors reported

Note:
This appears on the Q&A page as occurring as early as 1.7.1, so not marking as regression. Link:

   I got this too with SDK and Titanium Studio 2.0.2.GA on Mac OS X 10.7.4.
   
   This thread discusses the problem and considers the Mac OS X version and iTunes' state as possible reasons..
   
   iTunes complained the SIM card in the iPhone was unsupported. Removing the SIM card solved the problem.

   [~maxmikheev], can you please supply the full log output with the log level set to "TRACE"?</li>

   Closing as a duplicate of the linked ticket. The other ticket (TIMOB-12740) is technically a duplicate, but all work and the fix is against that ticket. So closing this one.</li>
