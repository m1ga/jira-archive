<h3>Description</h3>

As a result of the fix for #1542, we had to change a lot of the timing of when events occur on the main thread. This causes some visual problems such as views animating in at odd times, windows "popping" in/out of visibility while transitions in tab groups are occuring, animations not syncing, etc. It's difficult to describe the full behavior and reproduction steps. The easiest behavior to see is with Base UI->Standalone Window seeming to "pop in".

Trying to regress against 1.8.1, 1.8.0.1 to see if the issue is present.

   This is a new regression so we need to fix it ASAP and port it back to 1.8.X branch.</li>

   This ticket has been determined to be invalid. I regressed against KS 1.8.0.1 and 1.8.1, and it turns out that:
   
   * 1.8.0.1 has the same "popin/popout" behavior but it is *significantly* more pronounced, so our current behavior is actually preferable
   * 1.8.1 demonstrates the same issues
   
   This is an overall architecture problem related to window loading and drawing and should not be considered a scheduling bug.</li>
