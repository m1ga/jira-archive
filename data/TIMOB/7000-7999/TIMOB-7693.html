<h3>Description</h3>

In KitchenSink Base UI->Views->Table Views->Layout 3 when you click the +/- buttons to animate; the animations _obviously_ don't occur in sync. In previous versions there may be some (minor) lag between the two; that's a scheduling issue. It appears that the move to GCD throughout the code is causing some of this. More efficient scheduling is making our animations "worse".

   This issue regresses all the way back to 1.7.0 and, more importantly, has been intermittently reported by QE. The real issue is that we don't have an API which allows the batching of animations, so the scheduling is entirely up to the system. I'm creating a ticket for improving the animation API and resolving this INVALID as a result.</li>
