<h3>Description</h3>

From the original iOS issue:

When a searchBar is NOT attached to a tableView, instead attached to a view on the window, the cancel button isn't animated. Nor does there seem to be a property to enable it. The cancel button IS animated when a searchBar is attached to a tableView.

iOS now has an optional argument in setShowCancel, of setShowCancel(BOOL,{animated:true}) wherein the cancel button is animated in its hiding. If Android offers something similar, we probably should support it for parity's sake.
