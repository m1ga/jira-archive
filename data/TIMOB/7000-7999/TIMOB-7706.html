<h3>Description</h3>

When we run an application that uses V8 runtime on an emulator we currently use a "hack" to
simulate global references. This was original put in place due to hitting the global reference limit (2000).
This may no longer be an issue since fixing proxy memory management and clearing out old references.

If we do determine this workaround is still needed, we should finish "weak reference" support.
See the TODO in JavaObject.cpp for details.

   For Release 2.0.0 we will be switching off the global reference workaround used on emulator.
   We will hold off on removing it from platform completely until the next release. This will
   allow for some real world testing and confirm this workaround is not needed.</li>

   Since we've currently disabled this for 2.0.0, we will revisit removing it altogether for 2.1.0</li>
<li>Marshall Culpepper 2012-03-21

   This was re-enabled and changed to use weak references for TIMOB-7779</li>

   Closing ticket as fixed.</li>
