<h3>Description</h3>

When specifying the "prompt" property to a search bar, the prompt text initially displays the prompt mashed on top of the search field. After focusing the search bar, the display is corrected (in some cases, it may be necessary to focus then cancel, or focus, search and select an item. Not sure it's deterministic.

After the prompt is displayed correctly, there are several other issues: 

1) it's difficult to focus the search box (need to click a little "off" the box itself)
2) it's hard to click on the "clear/cancel" buttons (as above, need to click "off" the buttons)
3) the search bar covers most of the first row of the table

These issues all seem to be related to the fact that when properly displayed, the search bar with prompt is taller than its initial size.
