<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Problem</h4>
Project must be cleaned between subsequent runs against the simulator to remove build error

<h4>Expectations</h4>
Expect that when project is run against the simulator, that I don't have to clean the project each time to remove the symlinks to allow build to continue

<h4>Observations</h4>
* This particular project is the only one in which we copy files from /Resources (Resources/library/html) out into the /Library  (/Library/Private Documents/) in order to update/overwrite them. 

* Switching between sdks resolves problem with first run.

* Subsequent runs against the same sdk has problem

* Manually deleting files from simulator directory does not resolve problem.

* Removing app from simulator does not resolve problem.

   Now I'm concerned.  Upon further investigation, it has been discovered that 6 PNG files in the {project}/Resources/library/images folder were replaced with symlinks to nowhere.  When those original files were restored from the repository, the above errors disappeared.
   
   However, this raises a much graver concern in that original source files appear to have been modified/destroyed by the build script AND/OR the running of the application on the simulator.
   
   I won't have time to investigate much further today, as this has already wasted too much time.
   
   For the record, we don't manually symlink anything of our own.</li>

   Despite nearly 300 iOS builds since reporting the error has not resurfaced. May need to table this until it pops up again, Neeraj.</li>

   @Stephen - marking this bug resolved based on your last comment. Please reopen it if you encounter this issue again.</li>
