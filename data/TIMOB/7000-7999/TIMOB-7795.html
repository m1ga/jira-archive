   Cannot reproduce with latest master. ANR no longer exists. </li>

   Able to reproduce.

   Is this a crash or lock up?  Is there log output that can be referenced?  Since this issue is difficult to reproduce on the platform side, can we please get this information added to the ticket?</li>
<li>Dustin Hyde 2012-03-21

   This is a lock-up, the log is in the attachments.</li>
<li>Dustin Hyde 2012-03-21

   Attached new lock-up log. Attached new project file, making it easier to reproduce. In the modified project, the rss windows will close automatically after opening.
   
   Steps to Reproduce:
   
   1. Click on the first row. Wait for it to load and close. Repeat. (Press 'back' manually if necessary to back out).
   
   Bug: Screen turns black and clicks register on console as being unable to dispatch.</li>
<li>Opie Cyrus 2012-03-21

   Further investigation is required in terms of identifying the correct fix but this appears to be a issue with the lifecycle event of the top activity finishing being blocked on another event from the runtime thread.</li>
<li>Hieu Pham 2012-03-23

   We were unable to reproduce this issue on latest master. Marking as Unable to reproduce.</li>
<li>Lee Morris 2017-03-10

    Closing this ticket as the issue cannot be reproduced.</li>
