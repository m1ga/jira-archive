<h3>Description</h3>

Details: Mike received the same bug while testing analytics for iOS regression pass.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Launch a Titanium app
2. Monitor ti.start event from RightScale

Actual: city is San Francisco, postal_code is null, continent_code is NA

<code><pre>
{"city":"San Francisco","country_code":"US","country_name":"United States","postal_code":null,"latitude":37.7645,"longitude":-122.4294,"metro_code":807,"area_code":415,"continent_code":"NA","id":"F002D34E-D0A8-4E78-97A8-DF06F479EEDE","mid":"1695e43b6a2ef79a8ab6ce90d6ff78f313500671","rdu":null,"type":"ti.start","aguid":"d64cc020-bd6e-410c-88e6-3171df2dcccb","event":"ti.start","seq":0,"ver":"2","deploytype":"test","sid":"94844032-7DBD-4A89-9833-189F17ACE75E","ts":"2012-02-25T19:17:19.494+0000","data":{"tz":-480,"os":"iphone","nettype":"WIFI","un":"iPhone 4s Sprint","deploytype":"test","app_version":"1.0","osver":"5.0.1","version":"1.8.2.v20120223174636","platform":"iphone","model":"iPhone4,1"}}
</pre></code>
Expected: city, postal_code, and continent_code properties should contain the correct associated values.

   In order to fix this, we have 3 options:
   1) It sends start immediately with old values.
   2) It sends start immediately with NO values.
   3) There is a delay, possibly forever if there's success in location services, before the start event is sent.</li>

   I would prefer #1 if you don't foresee any issue with this approach.</li>
<li>Blain Hamon 2012-03-18

   Then I propose we mark the bug invalid, because this bug's behavior IS #1. The issue is that on start, the only geolocation information the phone has is the last geolocation information the phone obtained. The reason we don't see this more often is because:
   
   1) Look at maps app, find location
   2) Walk about building, stay in same city for 10 minutes.
   3) start app
   4) Ti.Start provides 10 minute old information that's still accurate.
   
   is more common than
   
   1) look at maps app, find location
   2) take a cross-country flight
   3) start app
   4) Ti.Start provides 8 hour old information that's cross-country.
   
   If the need to provide the age of the geolocation information is of use to analytics, we should open up a feature request linked to this.</li>
