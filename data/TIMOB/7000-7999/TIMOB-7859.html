   Apple has stated they are removing access to the macaddress and attempting to do so may cause app submission issues. We cannot guarantee continued access to the macaddress, but will investigate this issue.</li>
<li>Eric Merriman  2012-04-05

   Raising to blocker status as this will cause apps to fail verification since this is accessing the UDID. Unsure if Apple will have an issue with the MAC address per se.

   This should be handled as part of TIMOB-8173 (and is in fact covered in the documentation for the pull request for it). Going to mark it a duplicate.
   
   Although Apple is not yet blocking apps for macaddr access, I anticipate that they will be doing so for raw macaddr as it is what the current UDID is likely hashed from and falls under the umbrella of "unique device identifier".</li>
<li>Stephen Tramer 2012-04-05

   Actually going to mark this WON'TFIX, for two reasons:
   
   * Eric's blocker update is related to TIMOB-8173
   * Apple's UDID deprecation/reject policy does not appear to be leading to immediate macaddr rejections, but I anticipate that they will be checking for apps which access the raw macaddr as it is a "unique device identifier".</li>

   Closing ticket as the issue will not fix and with reference to the above comments.</li>
