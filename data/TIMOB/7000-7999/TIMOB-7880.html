   Hello,
   
   this is fixed in CI, in order to get it, you need to go:
   
   <a href="http://builds.appcelerator.com.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://builds.appcelerator.com.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html</a>
   
   select the "master" branch and copy the url for your OS.
   
   Then go to Ti Studio, and in the help menu, there is a "install sdk from url". Press there, paste the url and will install. 
   
   After that, go to your testing project, go to edit tiapp.xml, select SDK 2.0.x and save. Clean your project and build again. 
   
   Best,
   
   Mauro </li>

   Using SDK 2.0.0.v20120301000143 does not resolve the issue. I am still getting Uncaught Error: java.util.HashMap.</li>
<li>Jon Alter 2012-03-05

   Confirmed not working with 2.0.0.v20120302191704</li>
<li>Natalie Huynh 2012-03-12

   Confirmed fix with 2.0.0.v20120308234731 on Nexus Galaxy 4.0.2 Test ported in TIMOB-6956</li>

   In version 3.0GA the dialog doesn't show on top of my window, instead it is under my window, so only when the current window is closed can you see the dialog..</li>

   It works if I create a timePicker and then immediately show the timeDialog rather than pre-creating the timePicker, then it shows under the window..</li>

   Just wanted to thank @Mark from 2.5 years in the future. Your workaround works in 5.0.2.GA. This issue is still not fixed and is still open at TIMOB-16599.
   
   <code><pre>
   function openTimePicker() {
     Ti.API.info('Showing android time picker...');
     var timePicker = Ti.UI.createPicker({
       type: Ti.UI.PICKER_TYPE_TIME
     });
     timePicker.showTimePickerDialog({
       callback: function (e) {
         if (e.cancel) {
           Ti.API.info('Time picker cancelled');
           activeDateField.blur();
         }
         else {
           activeDateField.value = e.value;
           activeDateField.blur();
         }
       }
     });
   }
   </pre></code>

   Hi Cory, glad to be of service! I can't count the amount of times someone coming back to a question with a solution has saved my bacon, so glad to reciprocate.. 
   
   It appears the issue here is closed, could you re-submit for the current SDK version so they will look into it (hopefully)?

   Just found this and helped me fix the issue in my app too. Good stuff.</li>
