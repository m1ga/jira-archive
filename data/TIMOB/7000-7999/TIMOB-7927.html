<h3>Description</h3>

We have run into more ConcurrentModificationExceptions when sending out events by bubbling to the parent hierarchy of a ViewProxy. Since we are sharing event objects, this is causing the runtime and UI threads to iterate the same map at the same time.

The proposed solution would be to move bubbling over to the runtime thread (possibly in JS) so we can avoid having multiple jobs in the queue for one event. 

See my comment at the bottom of TIMOB-7774 for info about the original fail case
