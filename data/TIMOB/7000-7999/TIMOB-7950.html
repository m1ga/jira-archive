<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Request</h4>

Currently, permissions are automatically configured during the build process. While this is convenient, applications in the marketplaces may be perceived as more of a risk to install if they have WRITE access to a resource on the device when they only need READ access.

Hence, add a new setting in <code>tiapp.xml</code> that allows developers to enable/disable auto permissions (for example, <code>auto-permissions:true/false</code>) at their discretion.

   I believe this ticket refers to Android. Titanium doesn't seem to require permissions for any of the APIs to work.
   
   When building an app, the Android build parses the JavaScript code into an AST where we look for Titanium APIs that are used. From there, it can determine the minimum permissions needed for the Titanium APIs to work.
   
   This can be overwritten by using a custom AndroidManifest.xml. Simply build the app, then copy <code>build/android/AndroidManifest.xml</code> to <code>platform/android/AndroidManifest.xml</code>, then edit and remove the permissions. This is how to get rid of the <code>WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE</code> permission which was needed back in the day when apps were installed on an SD card and not the main storage.</li>
