Titanium doesn't seem to require permissions for any of the APIs to work.\r\n\r\nWhen building an app, the Android build parses the JavaScript code into an AST where we look for Titanium APIs that are used. From there, it can determine the minimum permissions needed for the Titanium APIs to work.\r\n\r\nThis can be overwritten by using a custom AndroidManifest.xml. Simply build the app, then copy {{build/android/AndroidManifest.xml}} to {{platform/android/AndroidManifest.xml}}, then edit and remove the permissions. This is how to get rid of the {{WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE}} permission which was needed back in the day when apps were installed on an SD card and not the main storage.",
