<h3>Description</h3>

Customer has requested a new feature to be included into the platform. 

The customer requested a property similar to the Titanium.API.setLogLevel property that exists for Titanium Desktop.

They want to be able to set the log level at production time to something like warn or error, and also eliminate other log statements including NSLog prints for trace and debug that come out of the Titanium native code.

This would include the Ti Platform Debug statements as well.
