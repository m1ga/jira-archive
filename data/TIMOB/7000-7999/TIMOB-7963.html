<h3>Description</h3>

On Android, the .top, .left, etc. properties on a tableviewrow affect the layout of the row text (but not the row decorations, such as checkboxes).

On iOS, these properties are ignored.

We should make this behavior more consistent.

   This was misfiled as a doc bug; it's a parity bug.

   IMHO, iOS behavior should be preferred. Positioning properties (top, left, ...) should have affect on component position within parent container. Row's parent container is TableView(Section) and positioning really doesn't make sense since TableView is a composite component. Text positioning is semantically wrong (although, I am exploiting this to have text padding in a row :) ) and should be replaced with proper property (padding).</li>
