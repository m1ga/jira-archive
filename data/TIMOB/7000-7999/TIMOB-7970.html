<h3>Description</h3>

We have a report from Dawson indicating that there are a set of "private symbols" contained within the latest TiCore rollup, related to libicu. Looking at the source, it turns out that this is the unicode collator, which we need to investigate a possible replacement for.

The private symbols that are being complained about are:

* ucol_close()
* ucol_getAttribute()
* ucol_getLocaleByType()
* ucol_open()
* ucol_setAttribute()
* ucol_strcoll()

Any TiCore which results from these changes will be labeled as TiCore-17 and tested/tagged appropriately.

   FR passed. I was the one to report this when an app validation failed through Xcode, and the same app with Tramer's PR is now passing. So I call this one resolved.
   
   To test, use Xcode's "Validate..." functionality to send an app to Apple for automated validation. If the app is detected to use private APIs, then you'll see a very easy to understand error message saying which are in use. If you don't, and the validate... passes, then we're in the clear.</li>

   Added a screenshot of the validate button I used.</li>

   First checked fail case. Note to all: When our project had "bad icon" and "bundle ID" mismatch it seemed to mask the private symbol errors. The validation reported these problems as expected, but nothing else. Once I fixed the icons and set the ID to match my entry on the developer portal, a new validation showed the fail case as expected.
   
   Verified fixed with SDK 2.0.0.v20120315131739. Used OS X 10.7.3, Xcode 4.3.1. See attached image for pass. Also checked the process with both Ad-hoc and Distribution provision. Checked Xcode 4.2 as well.
   
   Note to QE: This test case has existed for some time in the packaging test plan. There is no need to port this. I will add notes to ensure the application ID matches and the proper icons are included in the test project.</li>
