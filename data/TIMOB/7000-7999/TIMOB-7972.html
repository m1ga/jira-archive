<h3>Description</h3>

Description:
While testing the new builder.py script I ran through all possible iOS device targets with all deployment targets. When I packaged, my Xcode 4.2 application launched despite my desire for Xcode 4.3.1 to launch. I tried leaving 4.3 running, but this had no effect. This behavior is preceded by the log entry of:
«class menI» Organizer of «class menE» Window of «class mbri» Window of «class mbar» 1 of «class pcap» Xcode
Which is mentioned in a separate JIRA ticket and is being produced by the script: SDK/iphone/xcode_organizer.scpt

Steps to reproduce:
1) Install xcode 4.3 over 4.2
2) nullify your xcode-select setting by removing this file: /usr/share/xcode-select/xcode_dir_path
3) Install the SDK from pull 1638 
4) Run command-line command for packaging (using your valid provisioning profile)

Result:
Console output then 4.2 launches

Expected:
Xcode 4.3 launches

Note: 
Packaged applications will show up in the archive section of both Xcode versions since they share the same locations.

   Eric mentions PR 1638 in here, which was resolved and he signed off on the functional. Going to assume that means the problem is resolved/fixed.</li>

   I think this could be considered an invalid configuration. If a user has Xcode 4.2, Xcode-select would have been run. It would be set to /Developer. A subsequent Xcode 4.3 install over would be fine, but 4.3 would only be used if xcode-select were run and set to /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer. 
   
   With an Xcode 4.3 clean install one would expect the path to be empty, but since there is no 4.2 to launch, this issue is not observed.
   
   We need to message that a user installing 4.3 over 4.2 must use Xcode-select to choose the Xcode they wish to use. With the pull request I tested 4.3 clean with no path, plus 4.3 over 4.2 with the Xcode-select set in three ways: empty, set to 4.2 and set to 4.3. All worked as expected, but with no setting this bug was exhibited. Should we set this to invalid?</li>
