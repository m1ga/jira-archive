					"body": "I think this could be considered an invalid configuration. If a user has Xcode 4.2, Xcode-select would have been run. It would be set to /Developer. A subsequent Xcode 4.3 install over would be fine, but 4.3 would only be used if xcode-select were run and set to /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer. \r\n\r\nWith an Xcode 4.3 clean install one would expect the path to be empty, but since there is no 4.2 to launch, this issue is not observed.\r\n\r\nWe need to message that a user installing 4.3 over 4.2 must use Xcode-select to choose the Xcode they wish to use. With the pull request I tested 4.3 clean with no path, plus 4.3 over 4.2 with the Xcode-select set in three ways: empty, set to 4.2 and set to 4.3. All worked as expected, but with no setting this bug was exhibited. Should we set this to invalid?",
