<h3>Description</h3>

Developers would like more info about what JS is being evaluated when a crash happens posted to the crash log.  Any additional information that Titanium could output to a crash log would be appreciated.  Currently iOS crash logs sent in from users in the wild are very hard to correlate back to the application code.

   We should evaluate the same for Android platform as well.</li>

   Hello.
   
   
   This is, IMHO, extremely important topic. Currently on Android, when app crashes, Java exception is thrown (of course, when it is not related to JS directly) that can't be caught by try/catch in JS. Because of that, tracing the source of that exception and dumping execution stack is impossible (and that makes bug finding a hard task to do). Just by having the option to catch Java exception in JS we (developers) will have an option to build our own tools (by using JS) for debugging and tracing that would work on devices and not only on slow, buggy, slow and unreliable (did I say slow :) ) Android emulators.</li>
