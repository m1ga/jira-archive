<h3>Description</h3>

1. Open and compile the attached project
2. The first web view should come up and then the alert should have values false/false as there is no history.
3. Click on the link in the view to go to the second Web View.
EXPECTED RESULT: Alert should come up with values true/false as there IS an historical URL to go back to.
ACTUAL RESULT: Alert comes up with false/false. In different combinations it is clear the canGoBack() and canGoForward() are not working for local files.

NOTE: Also affects Android
NOTE: Mobile Web does not respond to the load event at all.

   Testing against master on Droid 2 (2.2) shows the correct behavior in terms of alert dialog values.  IE:  Open app ->  open second page -> open first page.  This sequence results in the alert dialog of "true / false" in the last two cases which is expected.  
   
   If I use a modified test case which allow for going back (in order to see the "can go forward" result) then I am able to see "true / true" alert dialog when using the following sequence:  "Goto Second Page -> Goto First Page -> <hit back button> -> <see "goback: true gofwd: true">
   
   Another issue is noticed is that the page content does not actually display when going forward or back via buttons.  New issue timob-8028 created to cover this issue and PR is being submitted shortly with fix.
   
   If issue still exists when built against master, can we please have any logcat data, device id and OS version provided as a update to this ticket?  This ticket will be resolved when 8028 is resolved through PR process.</li>

   Resolving based on successful results testing TIMOB-8028.  As Opie indicates, the true/false is correct in this item's test since goBack is **not** used to go back to the first page (therefore canGoForward does not come into play.)
   
   Indeed, even if goBack was used, there would be failure (as he also points out) since the page wouldn't load properly.  He fixed that via TIMOB-8028.  So the test cases in both of these tickets work fine now.</li>

   Closing as Fixed.
   
   SDK: 2.0.0.v20120315091738
   Android: V8, Rhino
   Studio: 2.0.0.201203142055
   OS: Snow Leopard
   Devices Tested: Droid3 2.3.4, GSlate 3.1, Emulator 4.0.3
   
   Bug Behavior: Back and forward load a blank page. See note below.
   
   Correct Behavior: Back loads any previous pages, stopping if there are none. Forward loads any pages that were navigated back from using the back button, stopping if there are no further pages. The alert dialogs accurately reflect the state of the webview history.
   
   Attaching new test project TIMOB-7991.zip.
   
   Note: This issue as-created is technically non-reproducible because the bad behavior originally indicated never existed. Any related issues have been addressed in TIMOB-8028.</li>
