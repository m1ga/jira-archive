<h3>Description</h3>

We've recently had a few community PRs that have brought up the fact that our current TCP socket implementation doesn't give enough control over timeouts in specific situations. We need to come up with a set of APIs that allow more granular control over timeouts for things like accept, soTimeout, etc.

Here's the links to the original community PRs:
