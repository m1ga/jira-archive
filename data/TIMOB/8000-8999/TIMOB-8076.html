<h3>Description</h3>

On older devices like Droid 2, GC lag cause result in a crash when:
1) alot of object are created resulting in high memory allocation on the java side
2) said objects are available for cleanup (no reference maintained in JS)
3) GC has not scanned yet due to the memory overhead on the V8 side not causing enough pressure on the GC

We need a way to notify V8 that we are running low on memory so that a GC occurs sooner than V8 would normally do on it's own.

A ticket has been linked that provides a fail case for this issue (original test case in ticket - not the one attached in the comments)
