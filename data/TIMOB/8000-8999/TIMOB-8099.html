<h3>Description</h3>

When attempting to build an application that uses an iPhone module with a custom module.xcconfig file, the module.xcconfig file is not processed during the build and the result is a build failure. 

Steps to reproduce:
1. Download Titanium SDK version 2.0.0 (06fdce0)
2. Create a new application is Titanium Studio
3. Copy the Styled Label module zip file into the project (or install in the Titanium system folder)
4. Update the tiapp.xml file to include the version of the styled label module
5. Build the application

The build should fail. If you examine the module.xcconfig file in the application's build folder you will see that none of the information from the styled label's module.xcconfig file has been added. The build log will list a number of undefined symbols due to the fact that the module.xcconfig information was not included.

This problem was introduced on March 9, 2012 with the change to compiler.py (commit: 7cccc3fccae5bf0cfaa4629afd17fb8f56012924). It appears that the indentation on lines 308-310 is incorrect, with the result being that none of the subsequent lines are processed. (See [TIMOB-7833])

   Note that the <code>all_load</code> also has to be removed from the <code>module.xcconfig</code> in order to get the build to work properly. The forced loading of symbols during the link causes a problem; there's an existing ticket for this.</li>

   <h4>TESTING</h4>
   ----
   
   <h4>Run tabnanny on the <code>support/iphone</code> contents from your project clone and make sure that there's no output:</h4>
   <code><pre>
   titanium_mobile&gt; python -m tabnanny support/iphone
   </pre></code>
   
   <h4>Run the scenario described as above (you will need to pull down the module, and change the <code>titanium.xcconfig</code> and <code>module.xcconfig</code> to point to the correct 2.0.0 version, and remove the <code>all_load</code>).</h4></li>

   Hello Stephen, 
   
   can you please share the ticket number of the forced loading? What does it mean for customers? Should they wait for a recompiled version of all paid modules? 
   
   Best,

   Hello Stephen,
   
   can you point out the solution for this issue? It is marked as dup. But I cannot find the thread that resolve this.
