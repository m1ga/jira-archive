<h3>Description</h3>

I don't know if this belongs here but, I'm seeing a situation where my ACS test app packaged for iOS devices doesn't send any analytics events. This includes ti.start and ti.end. We've been seeing this behavior ever since I updated my device to iOS 5.1 the events are not being sent. I've packaged several apps now that exhibit this behavior and Nika and I cannot seem to track down why this is occuring. We did manage to test the app in a 5.1 simulator and we saw a single ti.start event but no ti.enroll or ti.background events. We also attempted to get some ACS analytics events but they did not appear.

The weird part about this is that the app interacts with the Cocoafish API without difficulty. Any changes to the data stored by the backend can be seen with other devices so this isn't a problem with the connection to the api. This seems to be centralized around the sending of events.

iOS 5.0 doesn't seem to have the same issues (though the issues that we've been having with 5.0 aren't affecting the app in 5.1 (MOD-550)
