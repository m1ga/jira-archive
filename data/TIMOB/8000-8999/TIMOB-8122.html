<h3>Description</h3>

Ti.UI.INHERIT tells a control that it's width/height should be based on the parent's width/height, respectively. If the parent's width (for example) is SIZE, then the inherited width is SIZE, otherwise it is FILL. As a result, if a control inherits, the result will be either SIZE or FILL but nothing else. Another way to think about this is that inherit is a different type of "auto"...instead of looking to the controls default of FILL/SIZE, it looks to the parent to infer FILL/SIZE.

   I ended up tweaking the behavior for inherit some to better match how I needed it to act, and how I think people will want to use it. The behavior I implemented is that if the parent's width (for example) is SIZE, then the inherited width is SIZE, otherwise it is FILL. As a result, if a control inherits, the result will be either SIZE or FILL but nothing else. Another way to think about this is that inherit is a different type of "auto"...instead of looking to the controls default of FILL/SIZE, it looks to the parent to infer FILL/SIZE. I feel that this will be more useful for developers (plus it just feels less...hacky), but I'm certainly open for discussion.</li>
