<h3>Description</h3>

Mobile Web creates separators in table views by creating actual Ti.UI.Views. These are heavyweight and have other issues. We should rearchitect tableviews to set border-bottom instead. This is a technical debt issue and does not affect functionality.

   This bug is fixed in the Tizen repo. The fix may be directly ported to Mobile Web.</li>
<li>Bryan Hughes 2012-12-19

   Why is Tizen fixing bugs in Mobile Web? Mobile Web is supposed to form the base of Tizen, not the other way around. If they are hacking up the Mobile Web codebase, then they are doing it wrong because we will end up duplicating a lot of effort.</li>

    They were told not to change Mobile Web, and just file bugs. If they did find an issue and did a fix. There should be a bug for it and pull request.</li>
