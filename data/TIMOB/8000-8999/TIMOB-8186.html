<h3>Description</h3>

It has been requested to add the functionality to send x.509 certificate through SSL to the server while establishing HTTPClient connection.

So basically, during authentication process, client would be able to send a (.cer) file through HTTPS.

Essentially, something like this:

1) Package .p12 files/ .cer files as part of Resources, and 
2) Extract data from these files (an API from TiHTTPClient) and send it over to server.
