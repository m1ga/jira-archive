<h3>Description</h3>

With 2.3 Android, a new HTTP mechanism was introduced that gives us much greater power and flexibility.  We should investigate a full HTTP client refactor to address existing problems and re-evaluate the exposed API in order to provider a better interface for developers, increase maintainability and improve stability / performance.  This should first involve a overall parity and feature set discussion with iOS and other platform to settle on what the API should be (not simply a discussion of what's currently there).  Once the feature set is defined, we can evaluate how this can be incorporated into the existing API or if it should live alongside.
