   Reopening because issue is seen on Android 4.0.4 (Samsung galaxy S3) default browser.
   
   Titanium studio : 2.1.1.201207271312
   SDK version : 2.2.0.v20120810080115</li>

   Unfortunately we are already doing everything we can to prevent the text field from being edited (they were never intended to be non-editable). We simply can't do anything else unfortunately.</li>
