   Unfortuantely this is extremely non-trivial to fix. Right now, the only browser that supports date/time pickers is iOS, and even they don't support it well. To fix this, we need to implement our own date picker from scratch. The problem is that date pickers are very sensitive to internationalization/localization, and to implement them properly will take a very long time. Obviously we need to do this, but there is no way we can do it in Sprint 2012-07, so I changed it to a tbs-future.</li>

   Resolving ticket as Invalid as there is now a new version of Kitchen Sink available and we no longer support the version which relates to this ticket.</li>
