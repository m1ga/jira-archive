<h3>Description</h3>

When making Dev builds for testing locally on a device, my process has been to build the app -- which places my IPA in /Users/stevelombardi/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/Mobile Applications.

Since I need to get this onto iPads and/or iPhones which are paired with other iTunes libraries, I have been installing the apps by dragging them from the Finder to the device's icon in the Xcode Organizer window. As I said, I have been doing this ever since the release of Xcode 4, up through 4.2 and it's worked great.

However, now with 4.3.1, this process fails with the message

No application exists in /Users/stevelombardi/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/Mobile Applications/Tomato Match.ipa

I know the IPA is fine, because if I submit it to my TextFlight account, and install it on the iPad that way, it runs without incident.

So why can I no longer copy IPAs with the Organizer?

   @Steve - I believe, we fixed this issue a couple of days ago. Can you please try the latest master CI build (release 2.0)? Note that Titanium SDK 1.8.2 does not support Xcode 4.3 yet.</li>

   I ran into this problem (no .ipa files being created after selecting "Build For Device") yesterday when I removed my old installation of xCode (4.2) which was located in the /Developer folder on my hard drive.  After removing the folder, my 1.8.2 project would build apparently successfully from within Titanium but no .ipa file was created as the PackageApplication app could not be run. We tracked this down to a hard coded link to the old xCode /developer location on line 1446  of the 1.8.2 builder.py script:
   /Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/usr/bin/PackageApplication
   
   I copied the 2.0 builder.py script to my 1.8.2 SDK folder and commented out the two references to ensure_dev_path
   on lines 15 and 556, and the script runs successfully and the .ipa file is generated in the 
   build/iphone/build/Debug-iphoneos/ of my project folder.
   
   So it looks like the 2.0 release scripts are correctly supporting the location of xCode properly.
