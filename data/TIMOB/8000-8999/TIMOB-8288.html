<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Set up your Titanium SDK to exist under /Library rather than ~/Library on OS X Lion</h4>
<h4>Create a new Titanium Mobile Module project for iOS.</h4>
<h4>Build it. It will fail with the semi-cryptic error:</h4>
<code><pre>
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/ingo/Documents/Titanium Studio Workspace/testModule/build.py", line 217, in <module>
    build_module(manifest,config)
  File "/Users/ingo/Documents/Titanium Studio Workspace/testModule/build.py", line 162, in build_module
    from tools import ensure_dev_path
ImportError: No module named tools
</pre></code>

The fix is to open up /titanium.xcconfig and change the path of TITANIUM_SDK.

Since we store the path as a preference inside Studio, ideally this is a value we can pass in along the command line, or at the very least to the project creation scripts  (though this would not solve the issue  if they moved their SDK later)

My argument for bumping this higher in priority is that I've run into it, our QA has run into it, and other members of the team have run into it, leading me to believe a non-standard location (particularly for this people who upgraded from 10.6.8 to 10.7) is more common than not.
