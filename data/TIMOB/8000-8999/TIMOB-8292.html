<h3>Description</h3>

I came across an edge case which I think should really be fixed. By mistake I mistype the module which I wanted to include with the require function. The typo was a lowercase character instead of a uppercase character. Everything worked fine in the simulator but when I ran it on an iPad or iPhone the app crashed. After several hours of trail and error debugging by coincidence I saw the problem.

The expected result should in my opinion that the code should break also in the simulator.
