<h3>Description</h3>

Need to make mobile web as fast as possible. Ideas include:

* AST parser to optimize code
** Eliminate dead code
** Reduce size of code
** Detect event behavior, disable unused events and speed up responsiveness
** Use "Ti" instead of "Titanium"
** Remove named functions that are assigned to local variables
** Inline "small" constants (i.e. Ti.UI.FILL and Ti.UI.SIZE)
** Remove exceptions
** Convert all named colors to hex
* Custom AMD aware code minifier
** This would be an extension of the AST parser and would replace the closure compiler
** Remove comments
** Minify CSS, HTML, JSON
** Remove log calls based on log level
** Inline images
* General code reduction best practices
* Gestures/touch events
** Bind gestures on first use
** Queue and process touches every X milliseconds (where X could be 15ms)
* DNS prefetching
** Use <link rel="dns-prefetch" href="//somedomain.com">
* Lazy loading
** Split dependencies to soften the initial load time
* Deferred execution
** Only cache top priority JavaScript in require.cache()
** All other JavaScript is cached in commented <script> tags
* Local storage caching
** Cache modules in local storage with hash in cookie (requires server-side logic)
* Removing non-visible DOM nodes from view
* Moving static CSS styles out of code and into style sheets
** We set position, display, height, width, etc a lot and could be done using CSS
* Possibly use right and bottom styles to control width and height of elements instead of explicitly calculating width and height
** Browsers optimize for this
* Build a custom CSS manager to reduce number of CSS rules
* Make sure we're using hardware acceleration for all transforms and animations
** We may need to do a 3D transform to enable hardware acceleration
* Investigate the use of web workers to do background computations
** Layout computations
* Make layout UI elements lazy load (i.e. huge tableviews)
* Add support for appcache
** Device specific appcache optimizations
