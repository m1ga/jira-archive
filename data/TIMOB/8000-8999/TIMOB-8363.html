<h3>Description</h3>

Description:
On landscape mode keyboard does not fill the bottom of the screen. This bug occurs only on iPod 4.0.2 and exists in all test cases in Text Field and Text Area.

On iPod 4.3.5 when starting with the soft keyboard on screen, on orientation change, the keyboard animates off-screen then is redrawn after the UI has handled the orientation change. This occurred on both portrait to landscape and landscape to portrait orientation changes.

On iPod 5.1 the same behavior like on iPod 4.3.5, but this occurs only when making a portrait to landscape orientation change. For landscape to portrait orientation changes, the soft keyboard does not leave the screen during the orientation change, it simply rotates with the other UI elements.

Steps:
1. Run KitchenSink
2. Go to Controls-Text Field-Events
3. Click "Focus" button
4. Rotate device in landscape mode

Expected result:
Keyboard should fill the bottom of the screen and should not leave the screen during the orientation change.

Actual result:
Keyboard doesn't fill the bottom of the screen - on iPod 4.0.2
Keyboard animates off-screen then is redrawn after the UI has handled the orientation change - on iPod 4.3.5 and iPod 5.1
