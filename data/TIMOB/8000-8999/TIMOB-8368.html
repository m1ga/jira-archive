<h3>Description</h3>

Description:
While writing bug TIMOB-8363 we checked the behavior of this iOS feature on a variety of devices and found new behavior but unique in all of them. 

For the 4.0.2 device, the keyboard is not rendered correctly during rotation (see TIMOB 8363)

On 4.3.5 when starting with the soft keyboard on screen, on orientation change, the keyboard animates off-screen then is redrawn after the UI has handled the orientation change. This occurred on both portrait to landscape and landscape to portrait orientation changes.

On iPod 5.1 the same behavior like on iPod 4.3.5, but this occurs only when making a portrait to landscape orientation change. For landscape to portrait orientation changes, the soft keyboard does not leave the screen during the orientation change, it simply rotates with the other UI elements.

Steps to reproduce:
1) Using SDK 2.0.0.v20120328000206 build and install KS
2) Bring up the soft KB
3) Rotate the device

Result:
All devices show unique behavior, but in general there is a KB redraw. The older behavior was that the KB stayed on screen and rotated with the UI.

Expected:
The KB stays on screen and rotates with the UI.

Notes:
Does not occur with 1.8.2
