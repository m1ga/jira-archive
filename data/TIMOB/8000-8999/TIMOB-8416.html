   Also occurs on Emulator 3.0. Screenshot attached.</li>

   Bug persists.
   
   Studio: 2.0.2.201205292259
   SDK: 2.0.2.v20120530102130
   Android Runtime: V8
   Android Emulator: 3.0
   OS: Snow Leopard, Lion, Ubuntu 12.04</li>

   We have truly no control whatsoever as to whether or not the Emulator's Launcher app starts successfully. It has nothing to do with how we launch our apps.
   
   I have also seen this, particularly when running in VMs, low memory conditions, or when CPU is being considerably used up by another process.  (I.e., under conditions where the Emulator is starting up really slowly.)
   
   So unless I see a logcat that indicates that the launcher failure has anything to do with a titanium app, I consider this a "won't fix."</li>

   I believe this can also be caused by a corrupt emulator instance (AVD).  The attached log.txt looks like everything under the sun went haywire.</li>
