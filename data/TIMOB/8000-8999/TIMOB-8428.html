<h3>Description</h3>

Noted by Jeff H during a demo. Note that these steps _do_ appear to work for me, so I'm not sure if this was fixed already, or if there is a nuance I'm missing in the reproduction case.

<h4>Build an iOS project</h4>
<h4>Edit app.js to require the module</h4>
<h4>Add a new module to the project and edit the tiapp.xml manually to add the module</h4>
<h4>Rebuild the project. The app fails to run because it can't find the module. Doing a "Project > Clean" fixes it.</h4>

In speaking with Steven, it appears that platform needs to keep track of the last time the tiapp.xml was touched to know if it needs to do a rebuild.

   In Titanium SDK 3.0.0, the iOS build was completely rewritten and keeps track of a hash of all modules, then persists it to a build manifest. During the next build, it will compare the hashes and if it changed, it will correctly rebuild the app.</li>

   Closing ticket as fixed.</li>
