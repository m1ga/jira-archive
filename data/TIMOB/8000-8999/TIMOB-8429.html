   This appears to be a testing failure. Based on the log output, what may have happened is that a second instance of Kitchen Sink was launched while one was already operational (check the logs; there's a Kitchen Sink "startup" message after a bunch of layout warning output):
   
   bq. Mar 29 16:56:06 unknown UIKitApplication:com.appcelerator.titanium[0xaeb8][11556] <Notice>: [DEBUG] application booted in 1346.867025 ms
   
   In this case it may be that any connection that the first instance had to running services was terminated. We need more information before this bug can be closed as INVALID.</li>

   After talking with Dustin it looks like there may have been some kind of resource contention, and it's possible that the device itself has an issue; check the goog results for "endpointIOTimerExpired" (always seems to involve endpoint 81, as well).
   
   Going to mark the bug INVALID as a result and assume it's an apple firmware issue. If the issue can ever be reproduced, please reopen with some detailed information about what was occurring at the time of the crash.</li>

   Closing.
   
   This did appear to be a firmware issue.</li>
