<h3>Description</h3>

When the camera is opened for recording (video in this case), with the "Cancel" and red "Record" buttons displayed, the iPod and iPhone volume controls (on the side of the device) either do:
- Volume up: start recording
- Volume down: does nothing

This may be documented somewhere, but I cannot find anything about this. If it's by design, is there a way to work around this? I understand the up button is convenient to provide a "camera button" feel.
