<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Problem description</h4>
Density specific launcher icons are not used. Icons included in platform/res/drawable-<res>/ folders are not used.

<h4>Steps to reproduce</h4>
As described in <a href="https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides/Using+density-specific+resources+on+Android#Usingdensity-specificresourcesonAndroid-Theappicon" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides/Using+density-specific+resources+on+Android#Usingdensity-specificresourcesonAndroid-Theappicon</a>  , folders for specific icons resolutions are created. 

Different versions of myAppicon.png file is put inside each folder, however only the file icon specified in TiAPP.xml (<icon>/path-to-icon/myAppicon.png</icon>) is actually used. Other versions (set with the same name) inside res/drawable folder are ignored.

Same result if using the default appicon.png filename

   The filename (other than appicon.png) listed in the <icon> section of TiApp.xml isn't being carried into the AndroidManifest.xml file. I'd rather not name all of my apps' launcher icons "appicon.png"...that would get hard to manage with multiple apps.

   Still a problem in SDK 2.1.0.GA.</li>

   I just ran into this issue.   I have all my launcher icons setup in the platform directory, but Titanium is still requiring that the launcher icon ALSO exists in the /Resources/Android/ directory as well.  </li>
<li>Shawn Lipscomb 2012-09-28

   Ping, please take a look at the detail in the HD ticket referenced above..  Part of this problem is that the actual icon name listed in TiApp.xml is not carried over to the android:icon section of AndroidManifest.xml.</li>

   Based on the [doc](<a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/3.0/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/3.0/#</a>!/guide/Icons_and_Splash_Screens-section-29004897_IconsandSplashScreens-Icons%2Csplashscreens%2Candstorerequirements), the density-specific Android icons should be put inside platform/res/drawable-<res>/ folders and the file name has to be *appicon.png*. Tested with latest master and 3.0 branch. The density-specific icons work fine.
   Attached a test project "timob8507".</li>

   Ping, in your zip file, you still have appicon.png *also* listed under the Resources/android/ directory.  See Jon Barnhart's comment above about Titanium requiring it.  Under what circumstances does that copy of the icon get used?</li>
<li>Ping Wang 2013-01-22

   Shawn, I deleted the /Resources/android/image/appicon.png file and the attached project still works fine. When we build the project, we will always check whether /platform/res/drawable/*appicon.png* exists or not. If it does not exist, we will try to copy /Resources/android/image/appicon.png to /platform/res/drawable/. In this situation, the /Resources/android/image/appicon.png is used.</li>
<li>Shawn Lipscomb 2013-01-22

   Ping, thanks for clarifying.

   Does that go for any of the /platform/res/drawable-<res>/ directories, or just  /platform/res/drawable/ specifically?  I have \platform\android\res\drawable-hdpi, \platform\android\res\drawable-mdpi, and \platform\android\res\drawable-xhdpi directories, but no plain \platform\res\drawable\ directory.
   
   I just tried to do a clean build of a project and got this error in the Application Installer console window:
   {panel}
   <code><pre>
   IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: u'C:\\Titanium\\blablaWorkspace\\blablaProject\\build\\android\\bin\\assets\\Resources\\appicon.png'
   </pre></code>
   {panel}
   
   I'm using Windows 7.  I have appicon.png in these locations only:
   \platform\android\res\drawable-mdpi\appicon.png 
   \platform\android\res\drawable-hdpi\appicon.png 
   \platform\android\res\drawable-xhdpi\appicon.png
   
   So something is still wrong.  I have to throw a copy of the appicon.png file into this location to get it to build:
   /Resources/android/appicon.png
   </li>
<li>Ping Wang 2013-01-22

    Shawn, we only check for /platform/res/*drawable*/ directory. In your case, since you don't have /platform/res/drawable/appicon.png, we will try to copy it from /Resources/android/. And since there is no /Resources/android/appicon.png, it throws the error as you described.</li>
<li>Shawn Lipscomb 2013-01-22

    OK, got it.  I just tested and throwing the extra copy in /platform/res/drawable/ makes it happy.
    
    However, I still have two points:
    1. That's still an extra copy of the icon that will never be used.
    2. The only reason I have for the /platform/res/drawable-<res>/ directories is for the launcher icons.  Every other density-specific image is handled by the /Resources/android/images/low|medium|high|res-xhdpi/ directory structure.  It would be nice if Titanium would look in those (the latter) directories for the launcher icons also.</li>
