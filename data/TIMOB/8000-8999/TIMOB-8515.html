<h3>Description</h3>

A client has encounter a problem in the window.js file in the SDK.

I have not been able to reproduce it.

There is a "delete account" button than when pressed, it will fire a global app event. Ti.App.fireEvent();
This event will close all the open windows, except the "BaseWindow" (heavyweight window in declared in app.js), including the one where the button is. The button is in a lightweight window that sits on top of the BaseWindow. After the windows are closed, a lightweight window (login window) opens on top of the BaseWidow (in place of the previously closed one). And this is where they're seeing this runtime error.

   This is smallest test case I could come up with without leaving any major parts out:
   
   <a href="https://gist.github.com/fed5005b2ab33b6da445" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://gist.github.com/fed5005b2ab33b6da445</a>
   
   To reproduce:
   
   1. Run the code in app.js
   2. Click the login button.
   3. Login window (lightweight) will close and settings window (lightweight) will open
   4. Click the fireEvent and the app could throw a runtime error here.
   5. If #4 goes well without runtime error, that window will close and login will reopen
   6. Click login and then click on the "Open a window" button.
   7. Click the fireEvent button in this new window.
   8. If #7 goes well, all the windows will close and the login will reopen, otherwise, runtime error will occur.
   9. Repeat step #6
   10. Try closing the "other window" with the back button and click the fire event. It could fail here.
