<h3>Description</h3>

*Code*
<a href="http://pastie.org/3732988" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://pastie.org/3732988</a>

*Steps to reproduce*
Run the app inside the emulator/device, load up ddms, watch the heap size increase.

*Expected behavior*
The code is creating and releasing Ti objects, so it should allocate and deallocate memory over time.

*Actual behavior*
It actually keeps building up and gradually increases the heap size, it doesn't seem to go down a lot, it mainly increases. 

*Notes*
-You might have to run this for a few minutes, in order to replicate this behavior. 
-The app is opening a new window, and releases it. So you will see the window going back and forth, which is the expected behavior. It will automatically open/close the window over time. You should only have to observe the 'heap size' and 'allocated' in ddms.
-Only tested on the emulator.

   Hey Ryan,
   
   This fix has been scheduled for 'Sprint 8', which will be released on the 22nd of this month. The issue should be fixed before that date. Hope that's okay with you.</li>

   Okay, appreciate the update</li>

   This looks to be related to the issue fixed in TIMOB-7779. Tested on emulator using 2.0.1 and the leak appears to be gone.</li>
