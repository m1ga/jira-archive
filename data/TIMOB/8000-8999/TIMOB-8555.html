<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Problem Description</h4>
As there is no way to limit the iPad2/3 camera from automatically changing the orientation of the live camera if there is an orientation change, I need to find a way to dynamically change the overlay that we are showing over the live camera view.

I have added an orientationchange event handler to allow me to try to reset the overlay view width/height but any changes that I make to the overlay view width/height (changing from landscape to portrait and vica versa) do not appear to be picked up and applied to the overlay - the overlay remains showing with the original width and height in the live camera view.

<h4>Actual Results</h4>
The overlay won't change

<h4>Expected results</h4>
being able to provide the right overlay for landscape or portrait

<h4>Extra info</h4>
One way to accomplish this would be to provide a secondary overview for the landscape or portrait orientation

   How exactly does one change to a secondary landscape view after Ti.Media.ShowCamera has opened?  This is the problem I am battling - once the live camera view is showing with the overlay view that I passed in as a parameter to Ti.Media.ShowCamera, I can't seem to make changes to the overlay view or change the overlay to a different view formatted for landscape. This issue is only when using the camera module on an iPad2/3 where the camera rotates the live camera view and the overlay view on orientation change.</li>

    This can be achieved by  having all controls (for both landscape and portrait) inside the same overlay.Hide and show the controls by listening for change in Orientation. You can find an example for this in [here](<a href="https://gist.github.com/2408765)." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://gist.github.com/2408765).</a>
   
   So going to mark this ticket as invalid.</li>
