<h3>Description</h3>

When a project is packaged for production, every javascript file is duplicated and the duplicate contains "uncompressed" in the filename.

This does not occur in 1.8.1. This does not occur when "previewed in browser".

This also does not occur in iOS or Android, so any apps using the filesystem would behave differently in a MobileWeb production.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Create a new project.
2. Package for distribution.
3. Navigate to package directory.

Expected Result:

There should only be one copy of each javascript file.

Actual Result:

There are two copies of each javascript file, one containing "uncompressed" in the filename.

   This is by design. The idea is when you do a production build, the original uncompressed version is kept. If you run into a tricky bug, you can always restore the uncompressed file and see where it is causing problems.
   
   We have already planned to have a build profile setting "keep-uncompressed" that will remove those uncompressed files when set to false.</li>
