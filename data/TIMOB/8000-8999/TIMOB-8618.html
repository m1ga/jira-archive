   @Mauro
   
   Which option is crashing? "Take a picture" or "Choose a picture" ?</li>
<li>Mauro Parra-Miranda 2012-04-09

   @Marshall From the ticket: When trying to take a picture on an LG Optimus, the app crashes after seeing a preview of the photo and tapping "OK" to use the photo. Already updated the problem description. </li>

   On my Xperia-S this happens when I tap the shutter button. The picture gets taken and stored but the app crashes.
   In #TIMOB-4235 it is suggested to use an overlay, but this doesn't work: 
   - autohide : false
   - success : function(e) {alert("success");) is not called
   - all settings of the camera are ignored (such as shutter sound) and not available to set.
   I use Windows-7 and as of this morning the latest version of Titanium Studio(Titanium Studio, build: 2.0.1.201204132053), Android SDK etc.</li>

   Cannot reproduce this as well on DroidX (2.3.4) and Galaxy Tab (3.1) on master and 1_8_X.</li>

   Tested with LG Optimus 2.2.2 on both master/1_8_X. Unable to reproduce this issue. Marking as unable to reproduce.</li>

   Closing ticket as the issue cannot be reproduced and due to the above comments.</li>
