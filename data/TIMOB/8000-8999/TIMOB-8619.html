   I was able to work around this by adding a view to the overlay and setting a transform on that overlay with a rotate of 90 degrees. But it would be nice to have this working without having to add a second view.
   
   Also I noticed a different issue on the iPad. The overlay does rotate with the device however when I set the Orientation Modes to Landscape only it ignores the settings and rotates to Portrait. I have only tested this with SDK 2.0 at the moment.</li>

   On iPhone or iPod the camera window does not rotate natively, How it actually does is it captures the orientation change and animate a rotation on UI Elements visible on screen ( and some time hide and make some new controls visible accordingly).
   This is a [sample code](<a href="https://gist.github.com/2482221)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://gist.github.com/2482221)</a> that i have used to show similar behavior. You could do something similar to get the desired behavior.

   I know this issue is over two years old, but why was it marked as invalid? Surely the camera overlay not adapting properly to orientation changes is not the expected behaviour. I'm currently facing the same issue and these "workarounds" do not help.
   
   Currently using Titanium 3.4.1 (SDK 3.4.0.GA) compiling with Xcode 6.0.1 and testing on an iPhone 4 running iOS 7.1.2.</li>
