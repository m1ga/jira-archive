<h3>Description</h3>

It would be nice to be able to set a picker column to infinite, for example:

column: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0,etc etc

*notice the column would go back to the start after 9.

Currently, the only way to get a seemingly "infinite" column is to create an extremely long list of values for the picker, but this is not good for device resources, and is not clean in code. It would be better if a column could simply be set to infinite loop.
