<h3>Description</h3>

Playing a sound (Ti.Media.createSound) while the camera is open causes the shutter overlay to close, often not re-opening and causing the camera to be useless.

Playing a sound, then opening the camera fires camera error (i.e. the camera error function is called), then the camera cannot save the clip (i.e. clicking "Use"). The application then hangs, since the camera will not close and the "Cancel" button is disabled.

[DEBUG] Orphaned [object TiMediaSound] is trying to forget [object TiMediaSound].

This is the error object passed to the camera error function:
<Notice>: [DEBUG] [Thu Mar 08 2012 12:41:27 GMT-0500 (EST)] type = error
<Notice>: code = 1
<Notice>: source = [object MediaModule]
<Notice>: success = false

   Hey Richard,
   
   Eduardo posted a link to a community bug that has been submitted to Apple. This is a bug inside iOS, not Titanium, therefore we have no control over this. Once Apple fixes this issue, it should work again.

   Moved to Titanium Mobile section, this bug exists but needs to be followed up with Apple regarding this issue.</li>
