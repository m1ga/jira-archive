   @Wei
   
   I tested this again today and did not see this issue anymore. But I Believe there error was being caught in the following code snippet 
   <code><pre>
   Cloud.Objects.create(data, function (e) {
               if (e.success) {
                   alert('Created!');
                   for (var i = 0; i &lt; fields.length; i++) {
                       fields[i].value = '';
                   }
               }
               else {
                   error(e);
               }
               button.show();
           });
   </pre></code></li>

   Can you provide the actual data that was entered in the UI when attempting to create the object that failed?
   
   Also, what version of the module?</li>
<li>Michael Pettiford 2012-04-10

   @Jeff
   
   I no longer have the data that I used to create the object.
   
   However, I no longer am seeing this issue with the module from SDK 2.0.1.v20120410103239 hash rb11cc3e7</li>
