<h3>Description</h3>

Write a CLI specification that covers:
* CLI workflow
* Argument naming and value standards
* Initial set of CLI commands
* Initial set of CLI arguments
* External CLI APIs (for CLI modules)


The target list of commands should contain:
* Validation of project (module+app) creation arguments per platform
* Project creation - modules + apps
* Project migration between Titanium SDK versions
* Per-platform setup
* Environment / project validation
* Build project (APK, IPA, deployable web app in MobileWeb)
* Publish (may be type of build)
* Obfuscation/minification
* Optional Lint
* Emulator/Simulator launch
* Deploy project (to a device, to an emulator)
* Debugger / REPL

Other requirements that were gathered:
* Studio needs standardized logging and errpr message parsing
* Standard interfaces to basic commands across platforms
* Have a list of command capabilities / implementations per platform

   Do we have any existing information on the initial CLI spec from last June? Did we take photos or notes, or is that all lost?</li>
<li>Marshall Culpepper 2012-04-20

   AFAIK the list is completely lost, we will have to continue using the high level requirements we collected from our CLI meeting</li>
<li>Stephen Tramer 2012-04-24

   Driving CLI spec w/input from all core members</li>

   [CLI spec](<a href="https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/spe/Command+Line+Interface)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/spe/Command+Line+Interface)</a> has been taken to internal RFC: This ticket will remain open until RFC is closed (5/7) and comments from internal RFC are resolved. We will make the spec available for community input after internal RFC.</li>
<li>Stephen Tramer 2012-05-04

   Resolving this ticket a little early; comments from RFC appear to have ended and I don't anticipate any more by EOB Monday. There may be a second email blast.</li>
<li>Ingo Muschenetz 2012-10-07

   Reopened to fix remaining estimates.</li>
