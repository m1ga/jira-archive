<h3>Description</h3>

When an android app is installed, and that app is already installed using a different deploy type (i.e., production vs. testing), or a different app is installed with the same app id, there is an error INSTALL_PARSE_FAILED_INCONSISTENT_CERTIFICATES logged to the console.

I would expect the script to fail with a meaningful error message (and Titanium Studio to have an error prompt if necessary) indicating an app with the same app id and a different certificate is already installed on device, remove this app to continue installation.

Steps to Reproduce (Scenario 1):

1. Create a new Android project.
2. Distribute for production and install to device.
3. Deploy again to device from studio.

Steps to Reproduce (Scenario 2):

1. Create a new Android project.
2. Install to device in development mode.
3. Create another Android project with the same app id.
4. Deploy second app to device.

Expected Result:

Script fails with meaningful error message, studio prompts error if necessary.

Actual Result:

Failure [INSTALL_PARSE_FAILED_INCONSISTENT_CERTIFICATES] logs to console, difficult to know exactly what the problem is.

   This ticket may require Titanium Studio involvement.</li>

   This is actually an issue with development builds having a different keystore than the one installed by a production build.  In the new CLI, you can specify a keystore even in a device build.  This can be resolved if they specify a keystore for all their builds.</li>

   Tested Environment:
   
   Appcelerator Studio: 3.2.0.201311112306
   SDK:3.2.0.v20131111174605
   alloy: 1.3.0
   acs: 1.0.7
   npm: 1.3.2
   titanium: 3.2.0
   titanium-code-processor: 1.0.3
   Xcode:5.0.1
   Device: Google nexus 7(v4.3)
   OS: Mac OSX 10.9
   
   Not getting the INSTALL_PARSE_FAILED_INCONSISTENT_CERTIFICATES when installing different app with same app id.
   
   Tried for both the above mentioned Scenarios:
   Result for Scenario 1 was proper meaningful error message, studio prompts error as 
   <code><pre>
   [ERROR] :  Failed to install apk on "058429ec"
   [ERROR] :  The app is already installed, but signed with a different certificate
   [ERROR] :  You need to either manually uninstall the app or rebuild using the same certificate that was used to sign the installed app
   </pre></code>
   
   Result for Scenario 2 was it overrides the app as app ids are same.
   
   Hence Closing as working as expected and not getting the above mentioned error.</li>
