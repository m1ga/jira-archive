<h3>Description</h3>

In KitchenSink-Nook on the Kindle Fire, Facebook > Photos, when "Upload Photo from Gallery with Graph API" is click and the photo is selected, it is never uploaded to the Facebook page. There is no loading indicator, no success message, no error message.

The photo uploads correctly on all other tested Android devices (using regular KitchenSink where valid).

However, "Upload Photo from file with REST API" does work.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Run KitchenSink-Nook on the Kindle Fire.
2. Run Mashups > Facebook > Photos, login to Facebook as needed.
3. Click "Upload Photo from Gallery with Graph API" and select a photo.

Expected Result:

Photo should upload, there should be a success message, and the photo should be visible on the user's Facebook page.

Actual Result:

The photo gallery correctly closes and the app redisplays, but nothing else happens at all.
