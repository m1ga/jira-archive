<h3>Description</h3>

The documentation doesn't state that its impossible to run Ti.Database.install(Ti.Filesystem.applicationDataDirectory, 'mydb');

However not matter what you do, it is impossible, further more its a little frustrating as many a database strategy will involve remote files and source files that can be used for later purposes.

I can see no reason why the command has to default to the Resources directory.
Could there be some clarification on what you can and can't do. And if currently, you can't install from the appDataDirectory, can i suggest it goes high up on the roadmap.

this will cost days of developers time a) figuring out what works and doesn't work, then having to write a very long process in evaluating and inserting data, when its not necessary.

At the moment you can write to the DB storage space on iOS, it mainly affects android, but I think the SDK should allow for this behaviour.

   I will throw up a test case for this shortly

   You can use the following code to test this...
   <code><pre>
   function dbInsert(dbConnection, key, value) {
   	var sqlStatement = "INSERT OR REPLACE INTO properties(key, value) VALUES (?, ?);";
   	dbConnection.execute(sqlStatement, key, value);
   }
   
   var dbSourceFile = Ti.Filesystem.getFile(Ti.Filesystem.applicationDataDirectory, "Source.sqlite");
   Ti.API.info("@@@ dbSourceFile: " + dbSourceFile.nativePath);
   var dbConnection = Ti.Database.open(dbSourceFile);
   dbConnection.execute("CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS properties(key TEXT PRIMARY KEY, value TEXT);");
   dbInsert(dbConnection, "Message1", "This is message 1.");
   dbConnection.close();
   
   var dbConnection = Ti.Database.install(dbSourceFile.nativePath, "MyInstalledDatabase");
   dbInsert(dbConnection, "Message2", "This is message 2.");
   var resultSet = dbConnection.execute("SELECT key, value FROM properties");
   Ti.API.info("@@@ Database Table 'properties' row count: " + (resultSet ? resultSet.rowCount : "&lt;null&gt;"));
   if (resultSet) {
   	for (; resultSet.isValidRow(); resultSet.next()) {
   		Ti.API.info("- Key: '" + resultSet.field(0) + "', Value: '" + resultSet.field(1) + "'");
   	}
   }
   dbConnection.close();
   </pre></code>
