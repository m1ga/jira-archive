<h3>Description</h3>

It takes long to load contacts with images from the phone book. If I remove the imageView from the row the contacts (with no image) loads faster. It slows down the application incase the contacts are large in number. I've tested it for 20 contacts. Loading contacts with image takes 1 second (1000 milliseconds) and without image it takes 300 milliseconds
<h4>Repo Steps</h4>
1. Run the attached app.js file.
2. Check the DDMS for the timer values. 
3. Comment the imageView .
4. Run the app again and check the DDMS for the timer values (without image)

   The expensive part of loading the contents was calling compress() to output
   the images as PNG files.   With the change here, the images are now output
   as JPEG files.  It's quite likely that the images from the database are in
   JPEG format, and it makes sense that it would be expensive to convert those
   images to PNG.
   
   My test case has 121 contacts with photos.  Prior to the change it took 
   15.6 seconds to load, after the change it loads in 3.6 seconds.
