   We found a solution for this in the js code today:
   The "undefined" reference was caused by trying to register an eventListener with a function that was defined later in the scope. In the JS interpreter on Android, this is apparently fine, but in the JS to bytecode compiler, this is forbidden.
   
   But perhaps this should be handled by the compiler in some way, so that the user (we) get warned about this?</li>
