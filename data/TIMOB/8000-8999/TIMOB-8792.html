<h3>Description</h3>

We should create two "core" or "simple" controls for text and images. ImageView and Label are really heavy weight and are reused elsewhere...creating a simplified version that is used by those two controls, and any controls that use them, should give us a performance improvement (especially in memory usage).

These controls should inherit from Element to keep them lightweight.

We should go ahead and do the inheritence switch as Element->Widget->View, and move things like _add(), borders, etc into Widget to try and lighten up Element.
