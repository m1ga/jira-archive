   Attached picker.patch file which contains implementation of picker object with some (type, width, height, top, left) properties. 
   Because Cascades doesn't support generic Picker module (only Date/Time picker), we assume that when in JS we have
   createPicker, it should create DateTimePicker by default.
   By the time the patch was created, there was following issue issue:
    when we initialize value property in the JS, the V8 didn't make call back for that property e.g.:
   
   var picker = Ti.UI.createPicker({
     type:Ti.UI.PICKER_TYPE_DATE,
     value:new Date(2014,3,12)
   });
   
   and the other properties like, minDate, maxDate etc. which have JS Date had the same issue

   Harut, please list here all picker types that this control supports. Mention which ones you were able to implement, which ones can be done using combo box control (or some other suitable Cascades control) and which ones can only be done trough creation of a custom control.</li>

   Using BB DateTimePicker, I was able to implement following types of picker:
   PICKER_TYPE_DATE
   PICKER_TYPE_DATE_AND_TIME
   PICKER_TYPE_TIME
   
   for the PICKER_TYPE_PLAIN picker, we can use BB DropDown control consists of an expandable list of options.
   It is look like a picker, but the functionality is the same.
   
   PICKER_TYPE_DOWN_COUNT_PICKER picker type is crashing on android, according to the documentation it is a picker with a countdown timer appearance, showing hours and minutes. BB doesn't support suck kind of control, but we should be able to implement it as custom one.</li>

   Following are implemented in the scope of this task:
    properties: value, minDate, maxDate, type
    interface: setters and getters for above properties
    event: change (only type and value properties)
    inherited: top, left, width, height</li>
