<h3>Description</h3>

Every UI control in Titanium extends the View and as such inherit methods from it.  This implementation is missing from the current framework.  It needs to be implemented asap so as to minimize the rework to be done in existing controls at the time this is implemented.

To facilitate this change, we will likely include a container for all controls that we have, so the View methods to act upon.

   Downgraded to High priority.  The change will be to add a container at the NativeControlObject level, rename the class to NativeViewObject and implement all the View methods, properties and events.
   
   Talk to DavidC or JP for details.</li>

   Cascades Release: R4
   Elements Implemented: 106
   Elements Remaining: 25
   Details: anchorPoint, height, width need to be revisited to complete documented behaviour
            Many properties depend on R6 for getting the actual width and height of the container</li>

   Closing ticket as Blackberry is no longer supported.</li>
