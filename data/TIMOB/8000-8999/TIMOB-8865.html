<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Problem Description</h4>
Mail from FB with updates on the Android SDK, deprecating offline mode: 

"We recently made some important updates to the Facebook SDK for Android, and strongly encourage you to update to version 1.2.1 of the SDK in your app (VIN Viper). Specifically, this update includes:

A bugfix for a null pointer exception when using the SDK with older versions of the Facebook for Android App Full support for the offline_access deprecation Reduced debug logging by the SDK to make apps more secure by default for users who may have malware installed on their devices You can download the latest SDK here: <a href="https://github.com/facebook/facebook-android-sdk/." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/facebook/facebook-android-sdk/.</a> Offline access will no longer be available as of May 1, 2012, and you can make sure your Android app is prepared by following our guide here: <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/roadmap/offline-access-removal/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://developers.facebook.com/roadmap/offline-access-removal/</a>"

   See TIMOB 8339. Marking as hold.</li>
<li>Shannon Hicks 2012-08-07

   Blain - Looks like it's time to re-open this ticket, now that Facebook iOS SDK 3.0 is out of beta.</li>
<li>Ygor Lemos 2012-08-07

   agreed.
   
   It would be awesome to work on top of the 3.0.6 beta as it is going to release simultaneously with iOS6 presenting all new Facebook native integration features.</li>
<li>Blain Hamon 2012-08-13

   Leaving this as hold, or marking resolved, opening a new task specifically for 3.0. That way, there's no confusion between the original issue and things that are 3.0-related.</li>
<li>Lee Morris 2017-03-21

   Closing ticket due to the time that has passed since this was filed.</li>
