   Ironically enough, the fact that it got to documentation is a bug. The code itself has:
   <code><pre>
   // Not 'officially' a proxy since we don't want users being able to create these; they're
   // generated internally only for the media player.
   </pre></code>
   
   The reason for this is that TiMediaItem is a wrapper for MPMediaItem, which does not represent playlists but instead the read-only entities such as a song or book that can not be made on the iPhone.
   
   The class that we don't wrapper but what is desired for a playlist would be MPMediaItemCollection.</li>

   We do not want to expose this functionality at this point so the documentation should be fixed.</li>

   This is actually a TIMOB feature request, and a doc bug is already logged,  so moving back to TIMOB.
   
   Sounds like we're not going to implement it, so it should either be closed or moved to modules.</li>
<li>Arthur Evans 2012-05-16

   Per comments, the current implementation is as intended and the doc is wrong.
   
   If you need support for playlists, this should be raised as a separate feature request, although it sounds like this is more likely to happen in a module than in core.</li>

   Closing ticket as invalid.</li>
