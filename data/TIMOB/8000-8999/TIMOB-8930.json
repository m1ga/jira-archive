It is updated when the animation completes.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nThe problem is the dependency KineticScrollView has on Animate.js. If you stop a KineticScrollView (ScrollView, TableView, etc) via another touch, mid scroll, without having the rect updated, the scrollview will revert to its original position. \r\n\r\n{quote}\r\nWe're concerned about how the code parses the CSS transform settings. This should already be known because it was calculated during the animation.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nAgain, same issue. If you stop an animation mid-stream, like you can with a KineticScrollView (just touch the view while it is already scrolling), how do you know the position without parsing the CSS? \r\n\r\nI'm of the opinion that KineticScrollViews should not have a dependency on animation.js (via Ti.UI.2DMatrix). Tweening the css translation value via javascript it fine for small items, but leads to very poor performance on larger lists. KineticScrollView has quite a few issues including performance, and momentum (deceleration). I'm not sure what the policy is on using 3rd party libraries in TI, but refactoring KSV to use iScroll.js (http://iscrolljs.com/) would solve a lot of issues and simplify the codebase.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Mobile Web should probably just have a generalized animation engine that can be extended to handle Titanium's specifics.\r\n\r\nHonestly, I'd like to re-evaluate Mobile Web's entire layout engine, event system, and animation engine. They were all designed independent of each other and glued together. There's a bunch of places where we have duplicate code and hacks to get them working. Since they're all related, there should just be one engine that handles everything. This is outside the scope of this ticket and is not a priority either. :(\r\n\r\nFor the sake of this ticket, I'm not sure whether to merge the PR and resolve the ticket or to keep the ticket open until there's time to go in and properly overhaul Mobile Web.",

Without that, at least for me, they are non-starters.\r\n\r\nAppcelerator, as an organization may feel differently, but I think the real value proposition in \"mobile web\" isn't mobile web at all. The fact that you can build a \"*desktop web*\" app with the same basic code base as the native mobile app, now that is a value proposition. \r\n\r\nI don't have the resources to build a separate web app for desktop users, but with Titanium (plus 100 hacks or so and some jQuery) I do. \r\n\r\nPlease let me know if I can help at all.",
