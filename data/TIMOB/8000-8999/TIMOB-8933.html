<h3>Description</h3>

The <code>ScrollView</code> class has a <code>scroll</code> event which is fired repeatedly during scrolling.  However, the <code>ScrollableView</code> class does not have anything like this.

We need an event for <code>ScrollableView</code> s that informs us when a <code>ScrollableView</code> is being moved.  Tragically, the <code>scroll</code> event for <code>ScrollableViews</code> already does something else -- it fires when the whole view has been scrolled to another page.

So, I suggest we call the event <code>scrolling</code>.  It will be emitted continuously as the view is scrolled, and will contain such properties as

* <code>currentPage</code> - currently active page index
* <code>currentPageAsFloat</code> - currently active page index as a float, so if halfway between pages, this will have a value of 0.5
* <code>view</code> - currently active view

I'm working on an implementation of this and will pull request the iOS implementation, docs, and tests within the next couple of days.

   Changed title to reflect that this ended up being a redefinition of "scroll" and addition of "scrollEnd".</li>
