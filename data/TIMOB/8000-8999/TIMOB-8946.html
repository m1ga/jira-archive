<h3>Description</h3>

Need to ensure analytics is working properly.

* The deploytype is development, so it will be dropped by the analytics process. The deploytype needs to be production.
* There's no ti.enroll to create the app
* There's no ti.end to determine session duration.
* We need to verify the app GUIDs are different for different apps
* We need to verify that the sids are the same for different events in the same session
* We need to verify that the mid is different for each browser and machine
* We need to generate events with actual apps, and check that they show up in the analytics dashboard the next day
* We need to test app.feature events as well

The QA test plan for all these cases is similar to the end-to-end test cases for ACS analytics.
