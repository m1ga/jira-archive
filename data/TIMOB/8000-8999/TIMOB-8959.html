<h3>Description</h3>

The tiapp.xml allows for a property called "ti.ui.defaultunit" that sets the default unit. Mobile web's default unit is pixels (px).

For more information about the ti.ui.defaultunit property, look at the Ti.UI.View documentation: <a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/2.0/index.html#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/2.0/index.html#</a>!/api/Titanium.UI.View

   was this ever fixed in versions 3.x ?
   
   I am beginning to look into what it would take to change or set the default unit to dip. 
   This is actually important enough to be me to announce a bounty if I need to :-) 
   
   edit: when I generate a hello world classic titanium 3.x mobile web app I find this in index.html
   require("Ti/App/Properties", function(p) {
   	p.setString("ti.ui.defaultunit","system");
   });
   
   Does that mean that mobile web is actually now using dip or that system is actually still px?
   I'm still looking into this. this might be a closable ticket.</li>

   yeah. you should be able to close this issue. system really does seem to behave correctly. However, I am on a retina MBP. This should not matter, but it is worth testing on a non rMPB</li>

   ti.ui.defaultunit is not supported by Titanium Mobile Web yet. We haven't scheduled this yet and we haven't done the research to see how we should handle the various unit types.</li>

   Marking ticket as "Won't Fix" as MobileWeb has been deprecated.</li>

   Closing as will not fix.</li>
