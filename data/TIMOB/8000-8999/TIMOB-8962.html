<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Problem Description </h4>
It would be great if we didn't have to create our own Info.plist file to override common values. We can already specify android manifest parameters in tiapp.xml.

Examples:
I need an app with a shorter name for the Home screen (Bundle Display Name)
I would like to have a custom url scheme (URL Schemes array)
I want to specify all my icon files for a universal app (Icon files)

Since Info.plist is an XML file anyway, it seems like the same logic that went into the Android Manifest section of tiapp.xml could be applied here.

This would be something *really great* to have in 1.9 to bring parity between iOS & Android.

<h4>Extra info</h4>
The customer wants this happening in the tiapp.xml, so he doesn't need to edit a custom plist.
