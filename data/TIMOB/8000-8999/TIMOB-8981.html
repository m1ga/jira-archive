<h3>Description</h3>

Analytics.db, which is used by Ti Analytics, is being backed up to the iCloud by default, when the storage on device is backed up to iCloud.

The default analytics.db created has a size of 16.0 KB.

This could be found under Documents -> Application Support -> analytics -> analytics.db of the application sandbox.

*Steps to Reproduce*
1. Create a Titanium Mobile project with default template.
2. Load the app on to an iOS device and start the app.
3. Go to Settings app -> iCloud -> Storage & Backup and click "Back Up Now".
4. After it completes, click Manage Storage and select the backup for that particular device and see the list of apps.
5. It could be seen that the size of backup for this particular app would be 16.0 KB or more.

*Workaround*
1. Turn the analytics off before deploying the app to device through tiapp.xml by setting <analytics> to false.
