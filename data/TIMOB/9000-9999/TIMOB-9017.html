   This ticket requires some actual information about the requested feature. The summary is not enough.</li>

   Not critical anymore as we have been moving to commonjs so being compiled into binary not an issue. However the bug still is valid but on a low priority. Currently we are scanning the resource folder and when we see a JavaScript file *.js it is bundled in the binary and not available through the FileSystem poof - it automagically disappears so the following will not work:
   
   ...
   // bring in selector engine
   file  = Ti.Filesystem.getFile(Ti.Filesystem.resourcesDirectory, "lib", "sizzle.js");
   eval(file.read().text);	
   ...
   
   If more info is needed Blain explained the problem to me so understands what is sup here.</li>

   I got hit bug this bug. I have a .js file I use to inject some JS into a webView, and it worked perfectly on the Simulator, but on the device nothing happened. Finally after trying everything, I found this ticket. Can this please get fixed, or at least documented, so no one else have to waste time on this.
   
   For those wondering, the workaround is to just rename the .js file to another extension, like .txt.</li>
