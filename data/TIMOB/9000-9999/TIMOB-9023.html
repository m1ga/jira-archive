<h3>Description</h3>

Studio projects with filesystem changes do not rebuild on simulator deployment.

This is an edge case where files are added or removed from project sub-directories.

Attaching a project containing a module to demonstrate behavior.

This issue is not new.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Run attached project in iOS simulator.
2. Change '_modules' folder to 'modules'. This should cause a proper module include.
3. Re-run simulator.

Expected Result:

Module should load, app should work.

Actual Result:

Module fails to load. App only works on project clean and re-deploy.

   This ticket is basically saying that subsequent builds don't properly recover from a previously failed build due to missing ti modules.
   
   I tested with Titanium SDK master (6.1.0) and works just fine. I'm not sure exactly which version of Titanium SDK this was fixed. Titanium 5.0.0 had improved iOS builds, so certainly by then.</li>

   Closing ticket as the issue cannot be reproduced and with reference to the previous comments.</li>
