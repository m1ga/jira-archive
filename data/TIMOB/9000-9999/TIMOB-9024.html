<h3>Description</h3>

This task is for writing the <code>create</code> builtin as described in the [CLI spec](<a href="https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/spe/Command+Line+Interface)." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/spe/Command+Line+Interface).</a>

Depends upon the command API from TIMOB-9022 to be completed. This ticket *may* be performed in tandem with TIMOB-9022, in which case the "create" stub is unnecessary there.

Tasks include:

* Write "create" builtin
* Produce documentation (tdoc2, markdown, manpage, whatever)
* Test plan for "create" builtin
** We may want to consider using "node-unit" or another node unit testing framework. This could be an investigation task as part of this ticket as well.

   TIMOB-9180 also states CommonJS "create" is required.</li>
<li>Lee Morris 2017-03-22

   Closing ticket due to time passed since it was reported and the issue is no longer a problem.</li>
