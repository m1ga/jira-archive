<h3>Description</h3>

This ticket is for documenting and creating a test plan for the <code>build</code> command for the CLI. Note that this is a distinct task from implementation as it requires that *all platforms* have their implementations completed, and any specific settings/behaviors, documented.

Tasks include:
* Document build/install/run (tdoc2, markdown, manpage, whatever)
* Test plan for build/install/run

   Does this ticket mean that the titanium run command will come back?
   In titanium.py there use to be a run command which would be redundant if not for the fact that you could do:
   
   <code>titanium run --dir=module_directory_path</code> and directly execute that module without having the need for a 'test harness project'.
   
   This would be great to have back in the CLI. </li>

   [~sophrinix] No. There currently are no plans to implement a <code>run</code> command. I will fix the description.</li>

   [~bimmel], [~emerriman] Would you say that the Titanium build command has sufficient docs and "testing"?</li>
