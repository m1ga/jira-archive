   Just an update: no changes required in the code.  I have a request in (since Friday) to IT and to Cloud Engineering (e-mail to each of the Tonys) re what I need to do to get CI on ndk 8. As of yet, no response.</li>

   Update: in communication with Nikolai and access is being granted to me.  CLOUDENG-2558</li>

   NDK 8 is now successfully being used on the jenkins master server for titanium_mobile_master and titanium_mobile_2.0.x.
   
   Was unable so far to update the "Mac slave" for titanium_mobile_modules build because that machine is offline.  I alerted Nikolai.</li>
<li>Bill Dawson 2012-05-16

   Mac slave also updated, and a test run o the titanium_mobile_modules build was successful.</li>
<li>Bill Dawson 2012-05-17

   A test you can run to see if NDK8 was used on the build (run it from inside the version folder, i.e., /Library/Application Support/Titanium/mobilesdk/osx/2.1.0)
   
   <code><pre>
   $ strings android/native/libs/armeabi/libkroll-v8.so | grep udivsi3
   </pre></code>
   
   If it returns nothing, then it was built with NDK8.  If it returns anything else, then it wasn't built with NDK8.</li>

   Tested with 2.0.2.v20120516181650 ran strings android/native/libs/armeabi/libkroll-v8.so | grep udivsi3 did not return any values</li>
