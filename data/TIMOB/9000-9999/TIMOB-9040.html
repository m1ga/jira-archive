   While I'm working on this, I have to ask. 51 full-screen images is awfully expensive, and is causing memory panics (thus the crash on iPad 1). Why not use a video player and play this as a video clip? It'll be smoother and less a drain on resources.</li>

   I will be submitting a pull request as I did find ways we can shave some waste cycles and bytes when generating an image that is the same of the previous image. However, this will not solve the customer's issue. 51 full-sized images, even with fancy tricks, is too much for an iPad 1. I was able to recreate the memory-induced crash using as minimal and simple a native app as possible. In other words, Titanium is not at issue here.</li>

   Proposing this be marked invalid, and will be doing a pull request on related/linked issue.</li>

   Crash is caused by 51 images requiring too much RAM to be used on iPad 1. Could recreate natively.</li>

   Closing issue as invalid as per Blain's comments</li>
