   @amittal - Is this a platform or KitchenSink issue? Is this a new issue with 2.0.2 or does it occur with 1.8.2 release as well? Did you run this test with iOS platform? This tickets need to be filed properly with all the relevant information.</li>

   This is the platform issue. 'Focus' doesn't work with any android devices but works well with iOS devices.
   Tested devices: Samsung galaxy tab(V 3.2), Samsung Galaxy note(V 2.3.6), LG-p970(Android v 2.2), iPhone 3GS(5.0.1)</li>
