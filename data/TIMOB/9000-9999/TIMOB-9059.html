<h3>Description</h3>

Details: While testing a feature for ACS, I noticed when you login to Facebook, the default language will be set to Indonesian. You can get around this by switching to English at the bottom of the login screen.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Get and launch KS from 2_0_X branch
2. Go to Mashups > Login/Logout
3. Press Login with Facebook

Actual: Login window will appear in Indonesian. See attachments.
Expected: Login window should appear in English or the default language set by developer.

Note: This is *not* a regression. Appears in 1.8.2 and 2.0.1.GA2.

   Same situation with Chinese. I'm a Turk. But I use English locale and settings everywhere. my Facebook is in English. I do not know where this Chinese selection comes from.</li>

   Facebook login is Chinese in Android emulator and my Galaxy S2</li>

   I am seeing this also with Ingia in place of the word Login on the Facebook login web view, which Google tells me is Swahili.
   
   Swahili? Really? I certainly haven't selected this in the code anywhere.</li>

   Some more feedback on this. If I scroll down in the Facebook module's web view and select "English (US)" the page button text will change to English, however it introduces another problem. The new problem is that it is somehow triggering Facebook to maintain the Facebook app connection and asks if I want to install the mobile app, hitting cancel loads the Facebook main page after login (mobile version) still in the module's web view. If I close the web view by clicking the X in top right, this has the negative affect of not firing the event handler for the login. Which means the app appears to not do anything since the rest of the app is excepting to continue when the login event handler fires from the Facebook module.
   
   We are very close to releasing an app that is very much tied to Facebook. I believe there really could be 2 or 3 issues here.
   
   1) wrong language showing up (unknown reason)
   
   2) selecting language option on the module web view Facebook rendering is failing to let the module close the web view after the login process and the web view continues to act like  web browser on the Facebook page
   
   3) when closing the web view using the X, even if having logged in successfully to Facebook (due to item 2) the login event never fires - regardless of issue 2), the module should fire the login event if the user actually logged in because too much of how we code around this is relying on this event

   More research into this seems to suggest that the item 1) from my list above, the issue that is raised here with this JIRA ticket is actually occurring on mobile Facebook auth/login out side of Titanium.

   However, the other two items mentioned in my above comment seemed to be revealed as standalone issues with the Titanium Facebook module by this issue. If for whatever reason the Facebook language issue goes away, these other 2 items are still potential pitfalls that need to be addressed. 
   
   from above comment, the issues here are
   
   2) the module should not let its content navigation to continue once it has authorized the user (this is happening after changing the language)
   
   3) when closing the module's window through the X, if the user was authenticated and 1) or similar occurred, then the login even should fire (perhaps as an event on the web view close in the module)
