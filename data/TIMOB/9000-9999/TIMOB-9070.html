<h3>Description</h3>

Porting tool Stories

As a developer, I would like this tool to evaluate my titanium-developed application and provide a rating (preferably in a graphical manner) as to the suitability of this application for both android and IOS application compilation. I would like it to identify where modifications can be made to increase the suitability for multiplatform, or identify device/operation system specific functions that should be isolated to those folders. Success would be accurate representation of an titanium application's potential porting issues, and identification of where within the app those problems exist.

As a developer

As a development manager, I would like the tool to enable retroactive scanning of titanium developed apps and rate the suitability of those apps for porting to additional operation systems. Example would be a titanium built IOS App that has been deployed, the tool would enable inspection titanium code and identify potential problems for android port, could occur.  Success would be the tool's ability to examine titanium applications (in JavaScript) and provide reports consumable by developers and development managers

   AST parser (planned for 2.1.0 release) does the groundwork for this feature. AST parser would provide us the information we need for this tool. </li>
