		"description": "It would make the {{Resources}} folder in a Titanium project much cleaner if we had a {{platforms}} folder, under which all specific platform folders, like {{iphone}}, {{android}}, {{mobileweb}}, would reside. It just makes for less clutter in the overall project.\r\n\r\nWhile they serve 2 different purposes, we may also want to consider condensing what can be done with the root-level {{platform}} directory, and what can be done in the {{Resources/PLATFORM}} directories. Just throwing ideas out for discussion, but perhaps a layout like this would work...\r\n\r\n* Resources\r\n** app.js\r\n** platform\r\n*** android\r\n**** native\r\n***** AndroidManifest.xml\r\n***** res\r\n****** values\r\n******* strings.xml\r\n**** project\r\n***** app.js\r\n*** iphone\r\n*** mobileweb\r\n\r\nThis is probably not an ideal layout, but it gives an idea of how we can organize all platform-specific elements in one location without continue to crowd the project structure.\r\n",

					"body": "My concern is that the pollution of the {{Resources}} directory grows with each new platform we add. Soon a developer will have {{android}}, {{iphone}}, {{mobileweb}}, and {{blackberry}} dumped into their {{Resources}} path before they even start their project. As these folders pile up, they make for harder organization when a developer is attempting to establish their own structure, be it MVC or otherwise, or even eventually having ZipTi in their project. It seems to me that when a developer is defining a project structure, they will have a much easier time visualizing and creating it if they have 1 special folder to worry about accounting for instead of 4-5.\r\n\r\nI understand that we have a {{platform}} directory already, and I thought it may be beneficial to find a way to combine the project-level {{platform}} directory with the {{Resources}}-level directory, so as to provide a single home for all platform-specific code and resources. As stated above, I don't necessarily think that the structure I proposed is the best, or even a good one. I just wanted to get a conversation going on how we can better organize code and folders in such a way as to facilitate the building of scalable applications.\r\n\r\nWe are imposing structure now, just in a less structured manner. I'm suggesting we locate that imposition in a single, intuitive location. And yes, I share the concern of this potentially causing problems for existing apps. I don't think that precludes us from talking about how we can improve the structure of future (and many existing) apps though. ",

Instead of creating a \"platforms\" directory in the Resources directory, create \"Resources-ios\", \"Resources-android\", \"Resources-mobileweb\" (and so on) that would live NEXT to the Resources directory. This way things are explicit, more elegant, backward compatible, and we don't have to jump through hoops to blacklist platform folders from being bundled into the built app. I very much would like to add support for this in 3.2.0.
