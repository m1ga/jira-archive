<h3>Description</h3>

iOS has a disturbingly large number of "deprecated" properties and functions hanging around in the API, some of which have been deprecated since 1.6 (and declared to have been "removed" in 1.8). As a first step in codebase evaluation and maintenance, these deprecated properties/methods/classes should be removed.

Any property which is stated to have been removed in 1.9 or earlier should be removed from the codebase, and the documentation updated accordingly.
