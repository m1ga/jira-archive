<h3>Description</h3>

Currently iOS ships with two distinct versions of the <code>SBJSON</code> library - one which is compatible with (and has been modified for) Titanium since the early pre-0.9 release cycle, and a more modern, maintained version which ships for compatibility with the Facebook module.

We need to remove the older SBJSON library, update the latest version with the relevant parsing abilities from our managed SBJSON implementation, and clean code to make the code base more unified, consistent, and remove cruft.

   As we will use the iOS system-API's in TIMOB-24769, this ticket becomes obsolete. Resolving as <code>Won't Fix</code>.</li>

   Closing old "Won't fix" tickets. If you disagree, please reopen.</li>
