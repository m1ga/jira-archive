<h3>Description</h3>

Building tibbtest for Device-Release fails with the following error message:
<code><pre>
/Developer/SDKs/bbndk-10.0.03/host/macosx/x86/usr/bin/ntoarm-ld: /Users/jpl/src/titanium/titanium_mobile/blackberry/tibbtest/../libv8/lib/arm/libv8.a(api.o): relocation R_ARM_MOVW_ABS_NC against `a local symbol' can not be used when making a shared object; recompile with -fPIC
</pre></code>

NOTE: We've identified that the -pie flag causes the issue and removing it let's the build complete.

More investigation is needed to understand the implications of that flag and also ensure that the resulting app does run on a device

   Fixed by move to Cascades R4 and tools</li>

   Reopening as the issue reappeared with R6</li>

   Adding the request from Suavek for the build logs, i haven't followed up yet.
   
   "Can you send me the full output of the compile command line (I’d like to check the options you have)? The ‘-fPIC’ option should always be there in your case (<a href="https://developer.blackberry.com/native/documentation/com.qnx.doc.native_sdk.security/topic/compile_pic_pie.html)." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://developer.blackberry.com/native/documentation/com.qnx.doc.native_sdk.security/topic/compile_pic_pie.html).</a> Where did you insert the option?

   [JPL]Impact is we can't build release version of the apps.  As such without this fixed, apps created with titanium for BB can't be deployed to devices or the BB marketplace.  I don't think that you can use debug builds for that.</li>

   Closing ticket as BlackBerry is no longer supported.</li>
