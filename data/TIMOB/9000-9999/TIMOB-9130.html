<h3>Description</h3>

When an android project containing two versions of the same module is redeployed to the emulator using a different module version without cleaning the project, it appears both modules are included in the app.apk.

app.apk size with one module version: 5.5 MB
app.apk size with both module versions and project cleaning between deployments: 5.5 MB
app.apk size with both module versions when packaged for distribution: 5.5 MB

app.apk size with both module versions and no project cleaning between deployments: 6.2 MB

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Create a new Titanium Mobile project with Android selected.
2. Create a new Android Module with version set to 1.0.
3. Package the module to the project.
4. In the module "manifest" file, change the version to 2.0.
5. Package the module to the project (again).

There should now be a 1.0 and 2.0 version of the module in the project modules directory.

6. Copy the example app.js from the module to the project.
7. Clean the project.
8. Deploy project to emulator.
9. Check the app.apk size.
10. Change the module version in the project tiapp.xml to 1.0 (it was 2.0).
11. Without cleaning, deploy project to emulator.
10. Check the app.apk size.

Expected Result:

Both app.apk sizes should be identical.

Actual Result:

app.apk size is larger if the project is not cleaned and the module version is changed for the second emulator deployment.

   We are deprecating FastDev in version 3.2.0, so marking this as "Won't Fix"</li>
