<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Issue</h4>
----

On iOS 5.0+ only, the sound produced by Ti.Media.AudioPlayer (with default settings) only comes out of the right channel of a headset. The behavior (stereo sound) is correct on the 4.3.5 simulator, so this may be an Apple bug or behavior change between major versions.

<h4>Testing</h4>
----

You're going to want a pair of headphones for this one.

Kitchen Sink -> Phone -> Sound -> Remote Streaming -> "Start Streaming"

*PASS:* Sound comes from both channels
*FAIL:* Sound from right (or left) channel only
