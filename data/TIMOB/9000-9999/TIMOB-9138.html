<h3>Description</h3>

When a user purchases a module from the marketplace and tries to use it with an existing project, it doesn't work and shows the 'unlicensed module error' screen. It works fine if you create a new project and add the module to it.

A workaround is to create a new project and copy/paste the existing resource files into the new project, however this is not acceptable and shouldn't be happening.

   In this case, the client purchased the module called 'Cryptor' (3rd party) from the marketplace and it shows up the 'unlicensed module error' on existing projects. (Link to module: <a href="https://marketplace.appcelerator.com/apps/2479?1062962271" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://marketplace.appcelerator.com/apps/2479?1062962271</a> )
   
   This isn't just related to a specific module, this is for all modules, other customers get the same problem (no matter if 3rd party module or not).</li>

   To reproduce this issue:
   
   1. Purchase any NEW module that you haven't already bought before (try it with a free 3rd party module).
   2. Download it.
   3. Add it to any EXISTING project and try to run the app inside the iOS simulator.
   4. You should see the 'unlicensed module error' message appear.
   
   
   Workaround:
   
   1. Create a new project.
   2. Add the module to the new project
   3. Run it in the iOS simulator
   4. It will work fine, without any issues.
   
   
   I can't attach a sample project, because you have to manually purchase a module with the same account you use to log into TiStudio. 
   
   Let me know if you have any questions.</li>

   Junaid - we need the environment information for this ticket.</li>

   Added environment details, however this should be platform independent and should be reproducible on any host OS. 
   
   Let me know if there is anything else you need.</li>

   There are a few scenarios that cause this error;
   
   1. The project wasn't cleaned and the verification is cached as unlicensed
   
   2. The marketplace hasn't assigned the product correctly
   
   3. The user is running Studio without internet access
   
   Studio seems to play no part in this problem. I am marking the ticket as invalid and will re-open if I ever find an issue.</li>
