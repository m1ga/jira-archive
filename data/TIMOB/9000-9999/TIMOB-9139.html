<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Problem Description</h4>
When you do a deployment for distribution, you will think that the deploytype in analytics will switch to production. But it's not happening with some projects. A customer is not getting analytics from his app, and he reported it, the people in the Cloud replied that he didn't set the app to be in prod: 

The second issue, for the other app GUID 473b9203-836a-4d48-ac13-2993873efa2c, the problem is that the user is using deploytype:test, and analytics only shows up for deploytype:production.

When I asked the client to do for production (i.e., deploy it to the Market), he already did that, as the attached image shows. 

<h4>Actual Results</h4>
App is not set for production in the deploytype.

<h4>Expected results</h4>
If you build an app for distribution in the market, the deploytype should be production.

<h4>Extra info </h4>
See attached image.

   Some background on how the deploytype is set via build scripts:
   
   * User chooses "Distribute - Android Marketplace" in titanium studio and fills out the form.
   
   * Studio calls the android builder.py with the ["distribute" command](<a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/blob/2_0_X/support/android/builder.py#L2126)." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/blob/2_0_X/support/android/builder.py#L2126).</a>
   
   * builder.py's <code>build_and_run</code> function is called with the <code>install</code> argument set to <code>True</code>.  That - and the fact that the keystore information is also passed to builder - lead the <code>deploy_type</code> to be set to <code>production</code>.  ([code](<a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/blob/2_0_X/support/android/builder.py#L1663))." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/blob/2_0_X/support/android/builder.py#L1663)).</a>
   
   * That information is then used when we generate the Java source for the application's "AppInfo" class.  [My test app here](<a href="https://skitch.com/bill_dawson/84mm2/tistud1659appinfo.java-projects-ti-tistud1659-build-android-gen-com-billdawson-tistud1659-vim3)." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://skitch.com/bill_dawson/84mm2/tistud1659appinfo.java-projects-ti-tistud1659-build-android-gen-com-billdawson-tistud1659-vim3).</a> That sets the system "ti.deploytype" property for the application at runtime.
   
   * Then, when analytics is fired up at runtime, that "ti.deploytype" property [is read and sent along](<a href="https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/blob/2_0_X/android/titanium/src/java/org/appcelerator/titanium/TiApplication.java#L407)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/blob/2_0_X/android/titanium/src/java/org/appcelerator/titanium/TiApplication.java#L407)</a> with the analytics data.</li>

   Mauro--it appears that
   
   <h4>This should be working correctly</h4>
   <h4>The choice of deploy type is actually done inside the SDK scripts. There isn't anything Studio can do about it (in the code Bill links to, deploy type is not a parameter that's passed in).</h4>
   
   Have you replicated this yourself? If you have, it appears it should be a TIMOB issue.</li>
<li>Mauro Parra-Miranda 2012-05-15

   This is changing to TI mobile SDK, so they can give us their opinion. </li>
<li>Neeraj Gupta 2012-05-17

   @Mauro - Have you reproduced this issue yourself? All the issues that come from support team should have been verified? Why is this issue in the escalation list?</li>
<li>Mauro Parra-Miranda 2012-05-21

   Changing priority to next patch, working on a testcase. 
   
   Best,

   In the new CLI, the deploy can be set with the --deploy-type flag.  When building for distribution, it can only have a deploy-type of production.</li>

   Verified fixed on:
   Mac OSX 10.9 Mavericks
   Titanium Studio, build: 3.2.0.201312162209
   Titanium SDK, build: 3.2.0.v20131216191854
   CLI: 3.2.0-cr3
   Alloy: 1.3.0-cr
   
   CLI Android:
   --deploy-type can be set to test and development.
   --target can be set to dist-playstore for production.
   Production will override any --deploy-type parameters.
   Studio has package and run buttons which sort all this out for you successfully.
   Closing.</li>
