<h3>Description</h3>

Hi,
I've downloaded a new Version of Titanium Studio (2.0.1.201204132053) on OS X Lion 10.7.3, I've installed Xcode 4.3.1 But i have problems running a simple Test Application on the iPhone Simulator, I always get this error message:

[INFO] One moment, building ...

What's goin on? I couldn't find any solutions through Google :(


Best regards,

   Neeraj, I believe this is a TIMOB issue.</li>

   User has SIMBL installed and it's mess up the Applescript file that focuses the iOS Simulator. Not a Titanium problem.</li>
