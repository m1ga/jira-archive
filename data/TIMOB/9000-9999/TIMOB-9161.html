<h3>Description</h3>

Near as I can tell, both Android and iOS expose the Blob.type property, but not the constants for the type values (TYPE_IMAGE, TYPE_DATA, etc.)

At present, type is not documented in Blob.yml because it's not terribly useful without the constants. I think we should either expose the constants or not expose the 'type' property.

   Not actually a parity issue, as far as I can see--I don't think the constants are exposed on any platform.</li>

   Closing ticket due to time passed and lack of progress in the past 5 years.</li>
