		"description": "h2. Problem\r\n\r\nCurrently developers familiar with how to using Android's command line tooling can run Titanium-built APKs against Android new x86 emulator, so long as those APKs were built to run against the Rhino runtime. If the apps are built to run against the V8 runtime, they fail with the following errors from logcat indicating issues with missing stlport libraries. If necessary I can recreate these logs, but they should occur anytime you run a Titanium-built android app using V8 on the Android x86 emulator.\r\n\r\nh2. Proposed Solution\r\n\r\nThe way I understand it is that V8 is compiled with the Android NDK. All code compiled with the Android NDK is architecture-specific, and to this point it has only been built for ARM architectures. I'm sure I'm oversimplifying, but a build of V8 against the x86 architecture would likely make it possible for V8-driven Titanium Android apps to be run on the Android x86 emulator.",

Those emulators have to be installed separately from ARM emulators.\r\n* x86 may have launch errors involving HAXM (intel hardware acceleration) on some platforms.

Testing TiStudio\r\n\r\n*NOTE:* These steps are for Studio 2.0.2. Studio will eventually add ABI selection support and then testing will change significantly.\r\n\r\nStep 1.\r\n\r\n# Create a new app\r\n# Go to Run -> Run Configurations ...\r\n# Select \"Titanium Android Emulator\"\r\n# Select an API level which is NOT an x86 system image\r\n# Click \"Run\"\r\n\r\nPASS: App runs\r\nFAIL: Any other result\r\n\r\nStep 2.\r\n\r\n# Go to Run -> Run Configurations ...\r\n# Select \"Titanium Android Emulator\"\r\n# Select an API level which IS an x86 system image (currently only \"Intel Atom x86 System Image Android 2.3.3\")\r\n# Click \"Run\"\r\n\r\nPASS: App runs\r\nFAIL: Any other result\r\n\r\nh3.
