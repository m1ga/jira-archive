   The 2.0.1 and 2.0.2 CI build does not include support for BBOS7 devices. Furthermore, it also lacks some serious performance improvements we've done. We highly recommend you visit our CI build download site and download the latest master CI build: <a href="http://builds.appcelerator.com.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://builds.appcelerator.com.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html.</a>
   
   Once you install the latest master CI build, try your application again and if the performance is tolerable, let's close this issue. We have several other issues to improve performance across all environments.</li>

   The bad performance is partly due to the lack of power of the BlackBerry devices. Mobile Safari for iOS is much faster making it impossible for BlackBerry's web browser to run just as fast.
   
   Upon further investigation of the example link, the performance is greatly impacted by the poor design of the application and the lack of precaching includes and requires.</li>
