<h3>Description</h3>

We need to be able to support ti.verify on javascript (commonJS and MobileWeb) modules. This is a requirement for some of the enterprise-related modules that we are developing. In addition, module developers would like to put their javascript modules on the MarketPlace with ti.verify being used to confirm authorization to use the module.

   We require more information for this ticket. In the context of this request, does commonJS refer to:
   
   * Modules compiled from commonJS only for a specific system (i.e. prebuilt modules which are javascript implementations)
   * Modules which are raw javascript only</li>
<li>Jeff English 2012-05-22

   These tickets are for raw javascript only files. For example, the ti.cloud module is a raw javascript file in the commonjs folder. This is coming from community as well as internal needs to be able to package a single javascript module (commonjs) that can be used on all platforms.</li>
<li>Stephen Tramer 2012-05-22

   So the module will be completely in plaintext? That's what a CommonJS module that isn't compiled is. There's no way we can guarantee IP protection with that, although we could verify based on SHA1 hash.</li>

   Native JS module support has recently been added to Android so this is no longer a valid feature request.</li>

   Closing ticket as invalid with reference to the above comments.</li>
