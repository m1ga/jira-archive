   I would like to confirm this issue. 
   
   android 2.3.5
   Barcode module 2.3.0
   LG Optimus V
   Ti SDK 2.0.1.GA2
   
   Removing the strings.xml file results in a positive scan. With the strings.xml file in place, the app crashes as soon as the scan button is tapped.
   
   This is a critical issue for us, as we have a multilingual application to deliver with the scanning functionality. 
   
   Any word on a quick resolve regarding this issue ?
   
   Kind regards,
   Wouter van den Bosch</li>

   Created a module ticket as a TIMOB by mistake. Thats why closing it as invalid. Created the same issue as a module ticket.</li>

   Thx Nikhil. Can you link me to the new issue, so I can watch it ?</li>

   Hi,  
   I'm sorry Wouter. We are not allowed to make module ticket links public. Its a company policy. I'll make sure that it'll get fixed soon. We have one more customer who is facing the same issue. Could you please tell me your time frame to get a fix for this issue? I'll keep you updated here.
   
   Thanks</li>

   Hi Nikhil,
   
   Thanks for the update. No problem with your company policy.
   
   Our iOS version works just fine. Our Android version should be out within two weeks.
   
   Thanks for taking this into account!
   
   Best regards,
   Wouter </li>

   Hi Wouter,   
   Thanks for understanding. I'll try to get you a fix before that. Will tell our module expert about your time frame. I'll keep you updated.

   I'm having this same problem and would like to know what the fix was. This bug's status is closed but I don't see any documentation on the resolution. Would someone provide insight into what I can do to fix this problem?</li>
<li>Wouter van den Bosch 2012-06-08

   Hi Neal, 
   
   I've yet to hear from Appcelerator on the status of the fix to the module, mentioned by Nikhil.
   
   In the meanwhile, we have released a temporary single-language version of our Android app to the customer, without the strings file, which is far from ideal of course.
   
   @Nikhil, could you perhaps inform us on the status of the module's issue ?
   
   Thanks!</li>

    Hi All,  
    Sorry for the inconvenience. The fix is scheduled for Sprint 2012-13.</li>
