		"description": "h1. Problem\r\nWhen animating a view on Android through the transform property, the top left of the view is used, unlike on iOS where the center is used. Also, chained animations result in a jerky, unsmooth transition.\r\n\r\nh2. Reproduction\r\nOn iOS, this results in a blue box shrinking to 20% its size, then growing to 180%, then shrinking smoothly down to 20%, and so on, always centered. On Android, it shrinks to 20%, to the top left corner. Then it jumps to 100% size, and grows to 180%. Then it jumps to 100%, leaving the splash screen image visible through the white window, and shrinks to 20% the size.\r\n{code:title=app.js}\r\nvar win = Ti.UI.createWindow({\r\n    backgroundColor: '#fff'\r\n});\r\n\r\nvar box = Ti.UI.createView({\r\n    backgroundColor: 'blue',\r\n    width: 100, height: 100\r\n});\r\nwin.add(box);\r\n\r\nvar shrink = Ti.UI.createAnimation({\r\n    transform: Ti.UI.create2DMatrix().scale(0.2, 0.2),\r\n    duration: 1000\r\n});\r\nfunction doShrink() {\r\n    box.animate(shrink);\r\n}\r\nshrink.addEventListener('complete', doGrow);\r\n\r\nvar grow = Ti.UI.createAnimation({\r\n    transform: Ti.UI.create2DMatrix().scale(1.8, 1.8),\r\n    duration: 1000\r\n});\r\nfunction doGrow() {\r\n    box.animate(grow);\r\n}\r\ngrow.addEventListener('complete', doShrink);\r\n\r\nwin.addEventListener('open', doShrink);\r\n\r\nwin.open();\r\n{code}",

Testing Notes\r\n\r\n* Test on 2.2, 2.3, 3.1 and 4.x.\r\n\r\n* Run the attached project timob9207big.zip.\r\n\r\n* Test the \"fail\" branch (master).\r\n\r\n* * When you run the \"timob-9207\" test, you should really see awful behavior in versions < Honeycomb.  After a few animations, the background will show through and stick there.  Even if you run on Honeycomb, it will be jerky (though at least the background won't suddenly become transparent.)\r\n\r\n* * When you run the \"timob-8958\" test, when you touch \"Menu\" it will rotate, but then pop back.  (It's not supposed to pop back.)\r\n\r\n* * Run \"timob-7412\" test just to see how it looks.  The goal is to make sure the fix branch, which you'll be testing later, doesn't regress timob-7412.\r\n\r\n* * When you run \"timob-9433\" test, you'll see very jerky clockwise rotation.  It's supposed to be 7 clockwise movements in succession, then 1 that winds back counter-clockwise.  Instead you'll see that the 7 clockwise movements keep starting over from the original position, rather than moving in succession.\r\n\r\n* Test the fix branch (Bill's timob-9207 branch).\r\n\r\n* * When you run the \"timob-9207\" branch, any background that shows through should not be sticky. Unfortunately there is still a \"flash\" on <Honeycomb (whereas it should look pretty much perfect on >=Honeycomb.)  This flash has proved very difficult to get out.  The only big difference between a native app that I've created for testing it and our Titanium app is that we have our own custom views/layout (TiCompositeLayout).  I'm afraid it's somehow guilty in this.  Taking apart TiCompositeLayout (assuming I'm correct that it plays a role in this) to find out what it is about it that causes this to occur during animation is going to be a big task.  I want to at least get these current fixes in to stop the horrible background-shows-through-and-sticks problem, and to fix the >=Honeycomb jerkiness that was present in master.\r\n\r\n* * When you run the \"timob-8958\" test, when you touch \"MEnu\" it will stick in place after its rotation.  That's what it is supposed to do.\r\n\r\n* * When you run \"timob-7412\" you shouldn't see any real differences.  (This is just a regression check.)\r\n\r\n* * When you run \"timob-9433\", you should see 7 clockwise and successive steps (20 degrees each) without going backwards, and then one unwind step going counter-clockwise.\r\n",
