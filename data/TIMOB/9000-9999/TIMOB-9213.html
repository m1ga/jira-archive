<h3>Description</h3>

When the RSS Reader Sample is used, there is an intermittent crash on use. Log attached.

The crash occurred on a tab, so the back button was not a factor.

It is unknown if this is a regression due to the intermittent and unpredictable nature of the issue.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Download the RSS Reader sample from studio and deploy on Android device.
2. Navigate casually through the app.

Expected Result:

No crash.

Actual Result:

Intermittent crash.

   I was able to reproduce this issue via the same method as originally reported:
   
   1. Click on a feed.
   2. Scroll up and down on the feed detail window.
   
   Result:
   
   App intermittently crashes.
   
   This second crash occurred on the same feed as before, and only on that feed. Attached second log.</li>

   I'm unable to reproduce this crash after 15-20 mins with the app. Putting on hold for now until we can get a more consistent test case.</li>

   Closing this ticket as the issue cannot be reproduced.</li>
