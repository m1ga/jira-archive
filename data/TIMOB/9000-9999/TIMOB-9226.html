   We need to evaluate the JIRA feature requests and bug reports after 2.0.1 release related to composite layout feature and see if we need to enhance the spec and implementation.</li>

   I hope that composite layout specification will finally become publicly available since every developer should know it and understand it.
   
   
   I really don't understand the point in having it kept in private.</li>

   @Ivan - Composite layout specification has been available publicly for a while.  <a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/2.0/index.html#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/2.0/index.html#</a>!/guide/UI_Composite_Layout_Behavior_Spec</li>

   I wasn't aware of that link (there is also one private link), thanks.</li>

   @Neeraj - any info about vertical and horizontal layout specification? I have some issues with horizontal and vertical layout and I don't know what to expect (what is valid behavior). Having that two specs would clear things up.
   
   
   Thanks.</li>
