		"description": "IOS has a lot on limitations in the XML implementation. It is a partial DOM2 implementation. \r\n\r\nIt has no DTD support so notations, entities, entity references may not work at all. Also node mutation is only supported on the Ti.XML.Element so the following methods - `appendChild`, `removeChild`, `insertBefore` and `replaceChild`, although defined for type Ti.XML.Node will only work for Ti.XML.Element. They will throw an exception on all other kinds of nodes.\r\n\r\nThe `prefix` property for type Ti.XML.Node is read-write by definition but IOS defines it as read-only.\r\nThe method `normalize` is not implemented in IOS.",
