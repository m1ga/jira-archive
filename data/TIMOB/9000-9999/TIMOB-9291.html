   Investigations for this task:
   
   For generating moc files during the build we need to add target in the makefile which depends on main build targets.
   Currently tibb project is created as 'BlackBerry C/C++ project, which allows to build sources as static library.
   But this type of projects is building through the recurse.mk makefile which is the part of qnx
   (location C\bbndk-10.0.4\target\qnx\usr\inclue\recurse.mk), so we can't modify it to add new target.
   The solution could be to create 'BlackBerry Cascade C++ project' for the tibb', and modify the makefile and .pro project file
   to generate moc files during the build. For this type of project we also need to modify makefile so that it will build project as 
   static library (seems project properties doesn't allow to do it automatically.</li>
