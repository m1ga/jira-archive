<h3>Description</h3>

Credit to iotashan (Shannon Hicks) for finding this issue.

As of May 2012, Mountain Lion (with Xcode 4.4) breaks how we do builds. It's likely they've moved paths around again, or possibly even have changed or removed xcode command line options.

One issue that hasn't arrived yet is that our code (and assuming TISTUD as well) is not codesigned, which may cause issues in Mountain Lion.

We need to code sign the platform binaries for Mountain Lion.

   Looks like a temporary bug. <a href="https://devforums.apple.com/message/662314" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://devforums.apple.com/message/662314</a></li>

   Downgrading to something other than Xcode 4.4 DP5 resolves the error messages. This probably needs to stay open so that code signing can happen.</li>

   Getting the following message on builds:
   
   Build error after upgrade --- dyld: DYLD_ environment variables being ignored
   
   although it seems to run fine, at least on simulator...
   
   There is a public thread on it already:

   It also looks like it's not seeing anymore the distribution certificates, so it's no more possible to publish on the AppStore using Mountain Lion and Xcode 4.4 without using the workaround which consists of simply using Xcode to build and deploy, which, for Titanium Mobile project, is never recommended and also fails quite often due to some linker errors and signing errors (packaging operation failed).</li>
<li>Roger Mabillard 2012-07-31

   Quick suggestion: I think you guys should enroll in the Mac Developer program to get access to early releases from Apple so you can fix this kind of situation before it gets critical for us Titanium developers and customers. Anyway, thanks for the frequent updates lately! :)</li>
<li>Shannon Hicks 2012-07-31

   Roger,
   
   I can confirm that the problem is on your end. I'm having no issues publishing to iOS with OS X 10.8 & Xcode 4.4 using either the Ad-hoc/Enterprise or iTunes Store publish options. My guess is you didn't do one of the following:
   
   1. Used xcode-select to set your default Xcode instance.
   2. Downloaded the command-line tools in Xcode.</li>
<li>Roger Mabillard 2012-08-01

   Shannon,
   
   The command-line tools are installed, I used xcode-select to set my default Xcode, I regenerated all my certificates and provisioning profiles, still it doesn't show the distribution certificates, but instead it shows the development certificates. If you have any idea why that would be much appreciated :)</li>
<li>Shannon Hicks 2012-08-01

   I'm showing both my adhoc and distribution profiles. I would delete all the profiles & certificates from Xcode & Keychain Manager, and start over.
   
   Don't forget that you not only need the certificates, but the private key too.
   
   I would open a support request for help, since the problem you're having doesn't appear to be a bug</li>

   -There is also an iOS build to device error:-
   
   <code><pre>

    Running app in iphone simulator exits the simulator automatically.
    
    Getting the following in the console :
    
    <code><pre>
    [INFO] iPhone SDK version: 5.1
    [INFO] iPhone simulated device: iphone
    [INFO] Launching application in Simulator

    Additional information:
    - It seems that Xcode is now setting xcode-select. Although we were not looking for this at the time we started testing, we have discovered that the app is setting when you first launch. 
    - Xcode/app store is seeing cross-partition and updating on Lion when Xcode is installed there in Mountain Lion/Lion dual partition configurations.

    so any progress on this? I am seeing the exact same bug after upgrading</li>

    I solve "dyld: DYLD_ environment" error by change MYSDKVERSION/iphone/builder.py
    
    i insert "os.unsetenv('DYLD_FRAMEWORK_PATH')" before "# activate the simulator window"
    
    and this erro gone.
    
    now i running ok on simulator, but my studio can't encounter my mobileprovisions, and now i unable to package.</li>
<li>Adriano Paladini 2012-08-14

    Hi, i discovery the error with provisioning, Apple replace in Mountain Lion the OpenSSL for a common SSL (/usr/local/ssl), and this cause error in provisioner.py on line "from OpenSSL import crypto" on SDK version 2.2.x.
    
    If use 2.1.1GA, it works the provisioner. Titanium studio don't show my provisioning, but if i Browser it every time, it's compile.
    
    </li>
<li>Adriano Paladini 2012-09-03

    Hi All,
     I solve my Certificates error:
    
       In my 10.8.1, remove my python 2.7.3 from .bash_profile, now it's run on 2.7.2.
       This solve my error on provisioner.py on line "from OpenSSL import crypto".
    
       Then i delete on my titanium studio workspace the  ".log" file on ".metadata" folder.
       This make my provisioning's show on studio.
    
    Now i can compile with SDK 2.1.2GA and Mountain Lion 10.8.1  and Xcode 4.4.1</li>
