<h3>Description</h3>

After long press on two rows simultaneously,one row remains selected even after touch release

This is not a regression.It even occurs as far as 1.8.2

Steps to reproduce:
1. Install and launch KS 
2. Go to Base UI > Views > Table Views > Touch Events
3. Press and hold on a row with "Row Label" under your finger
4. without releasing the first row,Press and hold another row with "Row Label" under your finger.
5. Slightly swipe and release the finger of the row that you pressed first,without releasing the second.
6. Now remove the finger from the second row as well.

Actual: One row( the second selected row) remains highlighted even after the touch release and continues to remain highlighted even on Clicking the other rows of the table view. The selection of the row is removed only after clicking on the same row again. 
Expected: Row should not remain highlighted after the touch release.
