<h3>Description</h3>

Ti.UI docs mentions the following:

"Optimizations
UI objects are optimized by Titanium to not be realized into the drawing context and placed into the device UI surface until needed. That means that you can create UI objects, set their properties and add them to their hierarchy without much worry about memory or performance.
When the native drawing surface needs to render a specific view or control, Titanium will automatically create the view as needed. Additionally, Titanium is optimized to also release memory once the view is no longer needed, on screen or in low memory situations. However, it's a good idea to help Titanium along in certain cases where you are no longer using objects. For example, you should call close on a Window instance when you are no longer using it. You can safely call open on the window again to re-open it."


Profiling should be realized to verify if any modifications are necessary to align with this documented behavior.
