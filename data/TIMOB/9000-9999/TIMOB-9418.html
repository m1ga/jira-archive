<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Problem Description</h4>
Our customer is having different environments where the app is running (Dev, QA, Prod), and would like to do calls via httpclient into the right domain, according to where is it. 

Currently, there is no way to know where are you running, so you do a call properly to the right domain/server.

   Can't you just do this:
   
   <code><pre>
   var domain = Ti.Platform.osname == "mobileweb" ? location.hostname : "";
   </pre></code></li>

   notified the customer about this. 
   
   Thansk!
