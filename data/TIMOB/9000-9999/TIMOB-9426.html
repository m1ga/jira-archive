<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Request description</h4>

Customer wants to draw simple shapes and color. Currently, drawing a line can only be achieved by inserting a Canvas in a Webview, creating a View with 1px height or loading an image of a line.

The customer suggests to expose the coreGraphics API to javascript, so that it is possible to draw directly on the screen. One possible implementation could be the use of a dedicated Ti.Canvas view or space, with associated methods and properties such as drawLine, drawSquare, fillRect, etc... similar to html canvas.

   Also exposing/including CIImage and CIFilter would enable easy photo/video effects.
   
   I suppose all this could be done with a custom module too? </li>

   Very much so, Kosso. Putting everything into the core of Titanium doesn't scale anywhere as well as having CIImage and CIFilter and other such tools in the module marketplace. </li>
