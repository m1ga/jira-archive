<h3>Description</h3>

I have a webview that fire events inside the webview when user clicks on links and interacts with form elements. This functionality works fine when building for emulator or device but when building for distribution nothing happens when clicking links or any other form elements in the webview.

Use case is attached.  Using SDK 2.0.1.GA2 with the latest Titanium Studio on a Mac it works when selecting "Run on Device" but event does not work after a signed APK was generated with the "Distribute - Android Marketplace" option and the signed APK is installed on a device.
