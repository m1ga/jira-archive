<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Problem description</h4>

Customer is building a module for a third-party library and the developers of the library specify that you must use the -ObjC and -all_load flags when integrating into an app.

However, if they use -all_load to build the module, when they build the app they get this linker error:

<code><pre>
[ERROR] clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)
[ERROR]
[ERROR] Error: Traceback (most recent call last):
</pre></code>

Leaving out -all_load they get a boatload of unresolved symbol errors.

   From the customer: Integration of Titanium App with a Third-Party Automation Test Tool 
   
   We would like to use a third-party automation test tool that requires a module to be linked with the Titanium libraries. 
   However, there is an error in the linker process because the -all_load linker parameter is currently not accepted by Titanium's libticore.a library.

   This ticket does not have a full build log, including the exact link error, so we cannot resolve it. However:
   
   See the following for an alternative to <code>-load_all</code> which does not work with iOS for some (or even most) modules - it causes a namespace conflict:
   
   <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#qa/qa2006/qa1490.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#qa/qa2006/qa1490.html</a>
   
   Instead <code>-force_load</code> can be used with *specific library names only* to achieve the same effect without causing errors. Use that instead.</li>
<li>Stephen Tramer 2012-06-22

   Also note that using <code>-load_all</code> or <code>-force_load</code> on a library which contains an identical symbol name to something in Titanium will not compile. There is nothing we can do about this aside from internal symbol renaming, which is a viable alternative.</li>
<li>Stephen Tramer 2012-07-09

   Duplicate symbol issues may be resolved by TIMOB-5178. This is traditionally what causes problems with <code>-load_all</code> but it is still *recommended* to use <code>-force_load</code> on a case-by-case basis. We cannot really prefix/namespace category functions.</li>

   Did not receive requested information from ticket filer by sprint deadline.
   
   *DO NOT* reopen this ticket until the requested information is provided.</li>
