<h3>Description</h3>

Android and iOS have an API for accessing the device's compass.
Since not all devices have a hardware compass, you must test for its existence.

Android implements this as a getter property called "hasCompass".
Android also provides a function called "getHasCompass".
iOS implements this as a method called "hasCompass".

This creates an unnecessary parity difference. We should determine if this property
should be changed on one of the platforms to be either a function or getter property.
We could also introduce a new property/function to avoid breaking changes to this API.
