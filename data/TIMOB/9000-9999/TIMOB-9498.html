<h3>Description</h3>

Titanium.UI.Label.textPadding would be described as "Number of pixels before the text of a label."

At present the only way to pad is by adding a space character(s) to the beginning. This does not allow "fine" control of the text in a label when a background is utilized.

   TextFields have paddingLeft and paddingRight.  It would be nice to have these properties implemented for Label as well.  This would be especially useful when the label has a colored background, and you want a certain amount of that color to show on the left and/or right of the Label's text.</li>
