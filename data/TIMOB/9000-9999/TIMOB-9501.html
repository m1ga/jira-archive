<h3>Description</h3>

Titanium is great, but when it comes to give a client the mobile project, we see ourselves handing over 2 years of titanium javascript work.

I need a feature, where I can give my clients the source code, but not all of the source javascript files. 
The dream senario would be to let titanium generate all the javascript into objC .h and .m files, and .java files for android. I guess this is never going to happen?

The second solution would be to compile the javascript into one secure file, where its not possible to view the javascript source code.

   Hi Ivan
   That's only the apk. Not the source code project. 
   We need to deviler the project to our clients, how would I send them I java project without all the js files?</li>

   Hi everyone--I'm going to move this over into TIMOB, since the compilation/packaging bit is part of their tooling.</li>

   We do not provide the intermediate source code for the JavaScript code and we do not plan to add this feature in the near future.</li>
