   The events are firing correctly, but you can't see the label being updated due to it being covered up by the "tab change" label that keep appearing.</li>

   Once TIMOB-9487 is resolved this should go away.</li>

   Marking as invalid since this actually works correctly.
   The label is just getting covered by the tab change event window that keeps popping up.</li>
