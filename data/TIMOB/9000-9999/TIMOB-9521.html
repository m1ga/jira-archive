<h3>Description</h3>

Currently some events are sending more data than needed. We need to define what needs to be sent for each of the different events. Below is a list of data that is being sent:
id
mid
rdu
type
aguid
event
seq
ver
deploytype
sid
ts
data

Need to document when we should be sending all this information and when some information can be omitted
