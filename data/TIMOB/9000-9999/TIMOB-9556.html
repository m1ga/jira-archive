<h3>Description</h3>

Originally submitted as a doc bug, but it appears that we currently only support the ability to control whether or not files are backed up to iCloud. We don't support any of the synchronization and conflict resolution features of iCloud. For example, in answer the the last question in the original issue, I don't think we have any way to force a restore of a document that's synced to iCloud.


<h4>PROBLEM DESCRIPTION</h4>
The community has several questions about how to interact with icloud and their Ti Appcelerator apps. Common questions:

- How to use icloud?
- How to hide stuff from icloud?
- Where to put a db?
- What if I want that db to be synced with icloud?
- How to force a restore after a reinstall of the app?

Would be nice if we have an entry in the wiki or a blog post where we post how we handle icloud stuff.
