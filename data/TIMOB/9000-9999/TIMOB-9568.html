<h3>Description</h3>

While Testing Kitchen Sink, appending row and increasing height of current row also increases the height of another row.

This is regression. It works fine on 2.0.2.

Steps To Reproduce:

1. Install kItchenSink and launch it.
2. Click on Base UI.
3. Tap on Views>Table View.
4. Click on Append Row.
5. Tap on Append Row & height=100.
6. Tap on Append Row with Header 

Actual Result:
After step 5: New row gets appended.Height of clicked row ("Append Row & height=100") increases. But the height of row 1 also increases.
After step 6: New row gets appended.Height of clicked row ("Append Row with Header") increases. But the height of row 2 also increases.

Expected Result:

   This does not seem to be a regression.  I have tried to reproduce this on 2.1.0 (master), 2.0.2GA, 2.0.1GA2, 1.8.2, 1.8.0.1, and 1.7.5.  I get the fail case behavior for all of the versions mentioned.  This may be a bug, but probably not a regression.</li>
