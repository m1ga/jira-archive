<h3>Description</h3>

One issue not addressed from the original, cloned issue is the ability to specify 
 a shorter name for the Home screen (Bundle Display Name).

Test case:

Add the following code to <code>tiapp.xml</code>:

<code><pre>
    <ios>
    <plist>
        <dict>
		<key>CFBundleDisplayName</key>
		<string>Bob</string>
        </dict>
    </plist>
</ios>
</pre></code>

Build and run app. App should show up with the display name "Bob" (and the Info.plist in build/iphone should show "Bob" rather than ${PRODUCT_NAME}).

   Any progress on this? Having to create an /i18n/en/app.xml just to specify/set an 'appname' string seems overkill if all i want to do is change the CFBundleDisplayName.</li>

   Hi, It would be really good if this could be fixed soon. It used to work fine in prior releases, and should be a relatively easy Appcelerator to implement!</li>

   I do not see a resolution here, but I was able to rename the bundle display name by simply specifying the "name" attribute in the tiapp.xml file.</li>

   @Mike Neill, I think this means you can't have a different project name than the bundle name, and I've had issues in old versions of Titanium when project names have a space in them. This may not be the case any more, as I'm talking about Titanium 3.X and below.</li>

   Titanium 5.2.0 does seem to still honour having an info.plist file in the root of the project file. I noticed these values get copied into tiapp.xml on build, but it only works if you keep the info.plist file overriding the bundle name.
   
   What I've started doing is having a very simply info.plist that just does the bundle display name, and then specifying everything else in tiapp.xml
   
   <code><pre>
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "<a href="http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd</a>">
   <plist version="1.0">
   <dict>
   	<key>CFBundleDisplayName</key>
   	<string>BUNDLE_NAME</string>
   </dict>
   </plist>
   </pre></code>

   Thanks for the tip, James!</li>

   Hi James, thanks for the tip with custom info.plist, you saved my day!</li>
