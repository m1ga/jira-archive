<h3>Description</h3>

We are just seeing a facebook login button which tapping on does nothing & missing 'upload photos from gallery with graph API' & 'upload photos from file with REST API' .

4.Kitchen sink will fire up in the browser.
5.Tap on mashups tab.
6.Tap on the facebook table row.
7.Tap on the photos table row.
8.You will just see a facebook login page & tapping on it does not do anything,just an animation.
9.We are missing 'upload photos from gallery with graph API' & 'upload photos from file with REST API'.

Actual result:
