<h3>Description</h3>

If the element is visible=true and the animation is set to visible=false, then it should perform the animation, then set visible=false on the element. However, it immediately sets the visibility to hidden when the animation starts.

If the element is visible=false and the animation is set to visible=true, it immediately displays the element, but doesn't start animating. If you call animate() again on the element, it will properly animate. Based on the verbiage in the docs, it should animate it hidden, then show the element when the animation completes, but this doesn't make sense.

If the element is visible=true and the animation is set to visible=true, it works expected.

If both are visible=false (which makes no sense), then it should work as expected, but I didn't test it.

I have attached my test app that you can use to tweak and resolve.
