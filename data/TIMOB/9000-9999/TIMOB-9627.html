<h3>Description</h3>

Movie and its snapshot get merged on device rotation. Also, the labels displayed are being overlapped by movie snapshot.
This is not regression.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Go to Kitchensink >Phone >Play Movie >Embedded Video.
2. Rotate device.

Actual:
The movie and its snapshot get merged and the info labels are being overlapped by the snapshot.

Expected:
On device rotation also, the movie and its snapshot should be separate and info labels should be visible enough to be read.
