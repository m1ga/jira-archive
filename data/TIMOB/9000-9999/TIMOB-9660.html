   Unfortunately WP7.5 doesn't support touch events of any sort, so we can't support this functionality.</li>

   Just a clarification that the device itself supports the touch events but not the browser that ships on this device.</li>
<li>Chris Barber 2012-06-20

   Correct. The browser does not support mousemove or any touch events.</li>
