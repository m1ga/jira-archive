   lets make sure this is a valid bug please.</li>
<li>Eric Merriman  2012-06-20

   This is valid. Diff on the files show no change. Branch 2.0.X was checked out and 2.0.2GA used in regression test. 2.1.0 and Master for the original test.

   Based on discussion with Hieu, the behavior changed in the SDK, KS was updated to support the change, but KS Nook was not updated. Removing regression tag.</li>
<li>Tamila Smolich 2012-08-06

   Closing as fixed. Tested and verified on:
   Titanium Studio, build: 2.1.1.201207271312
   Titanium SDK, build: 2.1.1.GA
   Android emulator 2.2</li>
