<h3>Description</h3>

The remote streaming video when paused and application put to background, starts to play automatically when application brought to foreground. Also when it starts playing it initially plays video for first couple of seconds of the video and then resumes from the point where it was paused.

Not a Regression. This also occurs on 2.0.2

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Kitchen Application
2. Go to Phone -> Play Movie -> Remote Streaming
3. Let the video play for few seconds
4. Pause the video and background the Kitchen Sink application
5. Again open the Kitchen Sink application (to bring to foreground)

Actual: The video starts to pay itself. Also it initially plays video and sound of the first few seconds of the video and then resumes playing from the point it was paused.

Expected: The video should remain in paused state when the application again comes to foreground
