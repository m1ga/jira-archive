<h3>Description</h3>

Using the Titanium Create command through the command line, a titanium mobile project can be created in a directory with the same project name and App ID that already exists in that same directory. Also noticed that changes in Tiapp.XML of existing project get overwritten when project with same name gets created

Not a regression. This occurs as far as 1.8.2.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. In the terminal, run the following command
titanium create --platform=android --android=<path to android sdk> --id=COM.appcelerator.testapp --name=testapp --dir=/Appcelerator/Testing
2. After the project gets created make some changes in the Tiapp.XML file.
3. Again go to the terminal and re-run the above command

Actual: Success message is shown for creation of the project. Check the project and Tiapp.XML file. The updated time is  shown as the time when the command was run the second time. Also changes in XML file do not exist.

Expected: The creation of project with same should not be allowed through Titanium Create command

   You can no longer an issue for Titanium SDK 3.1.1.GA (and possibly others). If the project directory already exists, the new project creation is aborted unless the --force flag is specified.</li>

   Closing ticket as the issue cannot be reproduced.</li>
