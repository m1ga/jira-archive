Need to implement plain picker using BB drop down control.

Use the implementation matrix to see what's remaining (these are things that are not implemented but supported in Cascades):

   also need to implement following from the part 1:
   - conversion helpers all in the same place (should be in ConversionHelper.h)
   - setValue interface should take two param (implement second param)</li>

   The custom pickers in Cascades is only available in BlackBerry 10.1.
   Will postpone this feature until we bump our target version up to 10.1.</li>
<li>Russell McMahon 2013-05-26

   After talking to some BlackBerry folks I don't think we can assume shipping devices will have 10.1 by the time we GA. I also think do not think we should try to maintain 2 binaries at this point. We should postpone the 10.1 option picker until later in the year when more devices are upgraded and using 10.1. </li>

   Placing these items on hold for the moment based on community interest.</li>

   Closing ticket as BlackBerry is no longer supported by us.</li>
