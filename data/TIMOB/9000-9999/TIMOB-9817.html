<h3>Description</h3>

Reviewing TISTUD-568 and TISTUD-1524, it seems worthwhile to create some sort of description that encapsulates the possible values for per-platform configuration options.

The goal would be to provide a file Titanium Studio could read, interpret, and then display GUI configuration options for common platform settings as part of an extension of TISTUD-1824

While Studio could natively create a GUI for these items, the mix of an increasing number of supported platforms as well as version differences between SDKs makes this an increasingly problematic direction to take.

Some thoughts:
* XSD seems a natural option, but JSON is okay as well. We are alsread planning on creating an XSD for the root tiapp.xml file.
* Some items may require a drop down list of options, perhaps pulled from available SDKs (see iOS Deployment targets). Perhaps these could be encoded in a format Studio knows how to fill in with live values
* Android activities pose a problem, but perhaps there is some simple way that we can describe the common use case.

   This would be interesting, however it would be very time consuming and painful to maintain. Let's do it.</li>
