   This log file does not really help. We need more information to diagnose this issue. This may also be related to the third party module used by the application. We need this application and the module to make progress on this issue.</li>
<li>Chris Barber 2016-08-24

   The old Python-based tooling has been deprecated and replaced with a Node.js-based system back in 2012. I've never seen this issue with the new tooling.</li>
<li>Lee Morris 2017-03-24

   Closing ticket as the issue cannot be reproduced and with reference to the previous comments.</li>
