<h3>Description</h3>

Customer's comment:
"Currently, we have to use a web view with an HTML 5 canvas to draw lines, arcs, shapes, masks etc. In a canvas, we also have finer control over image manipulation. But a web view is pretty "heavy weight", presents challenges in the way that touch events are handled, and adds complexity when sharing data between the web view and the rest of the app. I'll be happy to talk to anyone on the dev team about details if the request is unclear."

   This feature request suggests a native canvas that can be used for drawing operations. This is going to be a huge undertaking.</li>

   There is a Module here for iOS: <a href="https://github.com/appcelerator-modules/ti.canvas" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/appcelerator-modules/ti.canvas</a></li>
