<h3>Description</h3>

The Android HTTPClient currently supports calling send() any time even if
a request is currently pending. We should not allow send() to be called if the ready state
is not "OPEN".

We should also make sure our ready state transitions match up with the other platforms.
Ex: make sure the ready state changes to OPEN once the request is done.

We need to document any of this behavior once it has been determined what is "correct".
