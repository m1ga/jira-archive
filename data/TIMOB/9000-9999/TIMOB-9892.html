   [Android Issue 33383](<a href="http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=33383)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=33383)</a> is still not resolved, but it does have an assignee and a status of "FutureRelease".  Some participants in the discussion indicate that a preview of ADT 21 may have fixed the resolution problem (though the virtual keyboard and trackball are missing.)
   
   Moving this JIRA ticket to next sprint to check Android's status again then.</li>

   [~dhyde] Could you please re-investigate this issue? The Android issue 33383 was resolved in July 2012 and so in theory a recent Android 4.x emulator will work properly on a retina MacBook Pro. Thanks!</li>

   I think this was fixed a long time ago.
   
   I remember it eventually went away, and I've never seen it again.
   
   I use a retina machine every day.</li>

   Resolving as not our bug and that we believe it has been fixed.</li>

   Closing with reference to the above comments.</li>
