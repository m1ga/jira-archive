<h3>Description</h3>

Code review identified that the level of class commenting was not sufficient.
We need to do a pass through the existing classes and ensure all of them have sufficient high-level description of the class purpose, its role in the hierarchy and its methods/properties.
This applies mainly to framework classes; and needs to be done before we can merge the work with the Appcelerator's main branch.

<h3>Comments</h3>

   I think reviewing the comments for any classes or methods that are "core"
   to the platform would be a good idea. Anything that may not be so trivial
   to understand from just reading the code. Any background knowledge or "why you did it this way"
   would be very helpful.</li>

   Closing ticket as BlackBerry is no longer supported.</li>
