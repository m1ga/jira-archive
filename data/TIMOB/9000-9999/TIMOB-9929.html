<h3>Description</h3>

With iOS 5, we now have the ability to customize aspects of iOS's button (and other views) that we previously have not. But in investigating a pull request, it has become obvious that there is an impedance mismatch with what Titanium exposes as backgroundColor (The color that most of the view is filled with) and what UIButton uses as backgroundColor (The color filling in the unused rectangle of the view) and tintColor (The color used by the button depending on circumstances).

   Wouldn't it make sense to implement one of the most common use cases, which is coloring the buttons in a nav bar context. Currently, they just adopt the navbar color.</li>
