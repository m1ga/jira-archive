   Hi Opie,
   
   I found this issue in Jira. Currently I am involved in specifing a system in which Bluetooth is essential. So for me it is important to know from which moment on a bluetooth api is integrated in appcelerator. In other words, I would like to have a formal statement from Appcelerator about this.
   
   Can you help me with that?
   
   Furthermore I am new to Jira, so I don't understand everything yet;
   Under 'fix versions' I see 'Release 3.1.0', 2012 sprint 22 core, 2012 sprint 22, what does that mean?
   
   Best regards,
   Raymond Verbruggen

   This can be a lower priority. We already iOS and Android Bluetooth support on the Marketplace.  
   Logical labs has written 2 of the modules (iOS Bluetooth LE and Android Bluetooth) and another party has written an Android Bluetooth module.  So this doesn't have to be done for 3.2

   No way!
   
   I am waiting for this functionality for over a year now. Every release coming out, this functionality is shifted for a release...
   Despite the availability of the modules you mention (in fact I am using both Logical labs modules and are very happy with that) I think they have to be present in the API to make Bluetooth easily available in Titanium using a common interface.</li>

   Hello, i´m also searching for the Bluetooth API and now see the Modules at the MarketPlace like Stephen Feloney point to but the Price is very heavy ...
   
   
   I hope that TI will integrate the Bluetooth API inside their framework because it´s really important to have standart Parts included like Other Frameworks done ....
   
   And if somebody says .. we have the party modules so we don´t need to integrate them, TI integrated NFC Module .. newer Phones used it but bluetooth is on "every" phone available!!
   
   
   Best regards,

   Sorry, sirs, but I *cannot understand* the very reasons why those expensively paid modules in the Marketplace would be any way better than official Bluetooth modules.
   
   Titanium is free, and it does support many networking features such as Wifi, NFC, and etc. Why does it not support Bluetooth? Is there any special reason for this being quoted to be in the 1.0 roadmap and now, after ~4 years, it's still forgotten?
   
   Why does Tizen, an almost unknown platform has Bluetooth support, and mainstream platforms are completely forgotten and we have to pay $700 if we want to support bluetooth in our apps? That's completely against the idea of sole developers that are very well encouraged by the original app stores - we'll never ever have money to invest on those libraries.</li>

   We are investigating how to speed up the delivery of this component by using Hyperloop to generate the module classes, but it is unlikely this will make it into the 3.3.0 release.</li>
<li>Michael 2014-01-16

   It's very disappointing that this won't make it into the 3.3.0 release. I have been waiting for this for a long time! Not sure why Bluetooth isn't given a higher priority as it's an equally important feature in a phone as location.
   
   I have also begun playing with the idea on creating a Hyperloop module for iOS. I am willing to help with this if it will speed things up? Let's make this happen!</li>

   Is there any specific reason as to why BT support is not provided out of the box and that we need to depend on external modules. We do not have any issues in creating a module or using the existing ones, but it will be very good if we know the reason for the delay or is there some other plan.
   
   The reason being that, when this same is questioned by us developers, we are in no position to answer them, apart from saying, "We do not know". Would request you to please provide us some more update.
   
   We have been using Appcelerator now for more then 2.5 years for most of our projects, so hope like always, will get a response from the AppC team.</li>
