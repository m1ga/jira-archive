   @NEERAJ: Is our goal to make it such that no code changes will be required at all by a Titanium developer using these modules?  
   
   I.e., should we still treat them as "internal" modules rather than external modules from the perspective of a developer using Titanium?  Our cloud stuff (for example), though packaged in the SDK, is treated as _external_, meaning a developer using Titanium needs to use <code>require</code>, like <code>var cloud = require("ti.cloud");</code>.
   
   So using Yahoo as an example, current code (by a Titanium developer) looks like:
   
   <code><pre>
   Ti.Yahoo.yql("SELECT ___ FROM ___ WHERE __", function(e) {//callback});
   </pre></code>
   
   Do we want them to continue to use it that way, or is it okay to make them switch to <code>require</code> such as:
   
   <code><pre>
   var yahoo = require("ti.yahoo");
   yahoo.yql("SELECT ___ FROM ___ WHERE ___", function(e) {//callback});
   </pre></code>
   
   The latter is a) easier for me; b) a cleaner separation; c) makes it clear that yahoo/facebook not part of core.
   
   The former is simply easier for our customers/users, of course.

   I think given that we are already moving facebook out of core in 3.1, this ticket may be invalid. </li>
