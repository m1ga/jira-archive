<h3>Description</h3>

This task actually involves two components:

<h4>Some kind of service which will serve the application to device - this can be local (i.e. a node service which pushes a notification to available devices and then terminates upon acceptance) or remote (i.e. part of our growing cloud infrastructure)</h4>
<h4>Tooling to interact with the service</h4>

Note that this is essentially the service which [Test Flight](<a href="https://testflightapp.com/)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://testflightapp.com/)</a> offers and some of our developers already use this service. The solution may simply be offering explicit Test Flight integration.

   I *cannot* have on-device debugging dependent on an active internet connection, a 3rd party service, and however fast my upstream is/how big my binary is. Presumably this ticket now blocks TIMOB-4626, so I wanted to get my $0.02 in now.</li>

   On-device debugging has nothing to do with OTA deployment. They are separate issues. On-device debug will only require that the device and the machine running the interactive debugger are on the same wifi network, which is the same condition as any direct-install solution would require. OTA installs will not be required for on-device debugging.</li>

   Should this ticket get closed, since TiShadow pretty much addresses it?</li>

   I think that Titanium should generate the ipa and maybe serve it over HTTP with the proper manifest plist file for Apple Wireless Distribution.
   
   This way, developers could simply access their host on the local network / specific port and get their apps delivered over local wireless. This avoids big binary uploads over the internet and solves the painful, slow and pointless iTunes sync.
   
   I already do this using a python+cherrypy script that scans ipas on the directory and manifests on the directory and serves them for wireless installs on the local network (and possibly over internet should your firewall rules and port redirects allows it). Maybe Appcelerator could do that on the titanium cli as a separate module / functionality, mirroring all built apps over an HTTP port.
   
   We can also study the possibility of doing this for Android APKs, leveraging a single solution for both platforms.
