<h3>Description</h3>

While running the refactored kitchen sink on android emulator, it keeps on crashing and retrying(do not renders finally).The logs have been attached with the bug.

This is not a regression. It also occurs on 2.1.0.

Steps to reproduce
1) Run the app on android 2.2 emulator

Expected result:
1) App should get installed successfully and appear on the screen

Actual result:
1) App displays appcelerator splashscreen and then a blank screen. This keeps on repeating.
Note: This happens only for android 2.2 emulator(HVGA and WVGA854) . Runs expectedly on 2.3,3.x,4.x.

   I am unable to reproduce this with the 2.2. emulator WVGA854. 
   Since your console seems to indicate perhaps a damaged SD card, Please try the following:
   1. Check your AVD manager (using "android" terminal command then "tools > Manage AVDs" see if the icon next to the emulator you are using is a check mark or a broken file icon
   2. If broken, or even just to be sure, go to "<YOUR USER FOLDER>/.android/avd/" and delete all those AVD files to create new ones with Studio. 
   
   Recheck the bug. If still occurring:
   Check that you are using "Google APIs 2.2"
   Try this on someone else's system and see if they have the same problem</li>

   I tried the steps mentioned above(removing device from AVD manager and re-creating it through studio) but its still giving the same error.This is occurring only for android google api 2.2 . 
   However this is not reproducible on other machines.</li>

   @Shyam-
   We would like to come to resolution on this issue for 2.1.1 release. Please investigate and provide any additional information. Please ensure your android SDK, NDK and any other tools are up-to-date.</li>

   The issue still occurs(on only my machine) with latest sdk,ndk. It occurs atleast as far as 2.0.1.</li>
<li>Eric Merriman  2012-07-27

   Shyam, when you get the opportunity, we need to fully investigate this. We understand it still occurs on your system, but we need to know why. We need solid data about your steps to isolate the root cause. Reducing severity since this only affects a single system.</li>

   Duplicate of TIMOB-10687.
   Tested on 2.2 Emulator on both v8 and rhino with the latest master. Can not reproduce the crash.</li>
