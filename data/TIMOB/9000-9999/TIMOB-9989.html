   FastDev is being deprecated in SDK 3.2.0. If you wish to use it, you still can from the command line following the instructions in <a href="http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#</a>!/guide/Fastdev_Reference_for_Android.
   
   It will be removed in version 3.3.0.</li>

   Can you give me more information why fast dev is being deprecated?
   It's very useful to me and faster than tishadow.
   Are there any alternative functions to quick test? :)</li>

   [~yomybaby] I am curious how it feels faster to you than TiShadow. Can you explain more?
   
   Our plan is to allow better usage of faster emulators like Genymotion, which have very quick startup times. You can experiment with Genymotion by turning on a flag in the CLI: TIMOB-15722</li>

   [~ingo] I love fastDev because there are no setting required.
   I add some shell script to External Tool of Ti Studio.
   When need to re-run, I just use keyboard shortcut.
   See this video.

   I love tishadow too! But tidev is a little faster on EMULATOR. 
   
   If titanium can re-run with only alloy build on Genymotion (like tidev), I can't ask for better. :)</li>

   Jong Eun Lee, 
   wow, so fast!
   
   Can you share your shell script or can you explain better "I add some shell script to External Tool of Ti Studio.
   When need to re-run, I just use keyboard shortcut." ?
   
   Thanks</li>
