<h3>Description</h3>

If I create window a with z-index 1, and then I create window b with z-index 0, window b is still in front of window a).  While coding windows which require the original window to stay stationary (such as coding window a to "slide-over" window b), I can't make this work because window b appears in front of window a (even if I set the z-index).

The layering of the windows, it seems, it only defined by the order in which they were created (ignoring z-index).

The only solution I have found, is to destroy window a, and re-create it, ensuring that it will be placed above window b.

Thanks for your help :),

   I believe this is also an issue with all components (views too).</li>

   For those who are interested, a work-around (not solution) to this issue, is to "push" window b down with window a, circumventing the need for z-index, since window b never needs to be position over window a.  But this requires a reference to window a, when animating window b.</li>

   Code to reproduce
   
   <code><pre>
   var win1 = Ti.UI.createWindow({
   	backgroundColor: 'pink',
   	zIndex: 2
   });
   
   win1.open();
   
   var win2 = Ti.UI.createWindow({
   	backgroundColor: 'orange',
   	zIndex: 1
   });
   
   win2.open();
   
   
   </pre></code></li>

   This is an invalid ticket. zIndex will only used to windows that being placed on the same view hierarchy and not on independently opened windows. The following code is how it should actually be added and it works. 
   <code><pre>
   var win = Ti.UI.createWindow({
       backgroundColor: 'green',
   });
   
   var win1 = Ti.UI.createWindow({
       backgroundColor: 'red',
   	height:120,
   	width:120,
   	top:50,
   	right:30,
       zIndex: 2
   });
    
   var win2 = Ti.UI.createWindow({
       backgroundColor: 'blue',
       height:120,
   	width:120,
   	top:100,
   	right:60,
   	zIndex: 11
   });
   win.add(win1);
   win.add(win2);
   win.open();
   
   </pre></code>

   So then is there no way to layer independently opened windows other than in the order that they are opened?</li>

   Dear Sabil Rahim,
   
   I think you guys should really consider adding this to the documentation. I have been looking for a way to open a window behind another one for ages, without making the app flash a black background (open back first invisible, then front). If I knew this, it would have saved me hours of time.</li>
