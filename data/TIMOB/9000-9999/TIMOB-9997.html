<h3>Description</h3>

<h4>Problem description</h4>

Built project for Android (%project_dir%/build/android) cannot be imported into Eclipse (that has ADT plugin) and compiled without modification.


<h4>Steps to reproduce</h4>
- compile small Titanium application:

<code><pre>
var win = Ti.UI.createWindow({
	navBarHidden: true,
	backgroundColor: '#000'
});
	
win.open();
</pre></code>

- inside Eclipse, run the import and select "%project_dir%/build/android"

<h4>Expected behavior</h4>
Titanium should generate Android project that can be compiled without any modifications.
Titanium project compiled for iOS has no problem with importing and compiling with Xcode

<h4>Current behavior</h4>
Eclipse shows the following error message:

"Android requires compiler compliance level 5.0 or 6.0. Found '1.4' instead. Please use Android Tools > Fix Project Properties."

   Hello.
   
   
   Could you please not change the reporter from community tickets that are accepted. The problem is that original reporter don't get any notification after reporter is changed to other person. Or at least add original reported to the watch list.
   
   
   (this is not the first time this happened)
   
   
   
   Thank you.</li>

   @Davide - Please do not change the reporter field when you move or update these tickets. Only time when it is permissible is when you are cloning the tickets.</li>

   @Ivan - i am a bit curious as to what purpose will it serve importing that project in Eclipse and running from there as it does not contain any source code (.java)</li>
<li>Ivan Skugor 2012-10-05

   Check "android/gen" directory.</li>

   Thanks Ivan for pointing but it still does not solves the purpose as my main app source "app.js" is either converted to CharBuffer or used as is. 
   So, what would be the intent of a person importing this project in eclipse as a person working on Titanium won't bother importing such a project.
   
   Therefore, this ticket should go with Low priority instead of High.</li>

   For possible solution, investigate the ti_eclipsify.py script here: <a href="https://github.com/billdawson/tidevtools." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/billdawson/tidevtools.</a></li>
